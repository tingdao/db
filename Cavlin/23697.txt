<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Then Jesus said to his disciples. </em>As Christ saw that Peter had a dread of <em>the cross</em>, and that all the rest were affected in the same way, he enters into a general discourse about <em>bearing the cross</em>, and does not limit his address to the twelve apostles, but lays down the same law for all the godly. <span class="cite-ref">(463)</span> We have already met with a statement nearly similar, (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:38</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(464)</span> But in that passage the apostles were only reminded of the persecution which awaited them, as soon as they should begin to discharge their office; while a general instruction is here conveyed, and the initiatory lessons, so to speak, inculcated on all who profess to believe the Gospel. </p><p><em>If any man will come after me. </em>These words are used for the express purpose of refuting the false views of Peter <span class="cite-ref">(465)</span> Presenting himself to every one as an example of self-denial and of patience, he first shows that it was necessary for him to endure what Peter reckoned to be inconsistent with his character, and next invites every member of his body to imitate him. The words must be explained in this manner: “If any man would be my disciple, let him <em>follow me by denying himself and taking up his cross</em>, or, let him conform himself to my example.” The meaning is, that none can be reckoned to be the disciples of Christ unless they are true imitators of him, and are willing to pursue the same course. </p><p>He lays down a brief rule for our imitation, in order to make us acquainted with the chief points in which he wishes us to resemble him. It consists of two parts, <em>self-denial </em>and a voluntary <em>bearing of the cross. Let him deny himself. </em>This <em>self-denial </em>is very extensive, and implies that we ought to give up our natural inclinations, and part with all the affections of the flesh, and thus give our consent to be reduced to nothing, provided that God lives and reigns in us. We know with what blind love men naturally regard themselves, how much they are devoted to themselves, how highly they estimate themselves. But if we desire to enter into the school of Christ, we must begin with that folly to which Paul (<span class="bvs">1Co_3:18</span>) exhorts us, <em>becoming fools</em>, <em>that we may be wise; </em>and next we must control and subdue all our affections. </p><p><em>And let him take up his cross. </em>He lays down this injunction, because, though there are common miseries to which the life of men is indiscriminately subjected, yet as God trains his people in a peculiar manner, in order that they may be <em>conformed to the image of his Son, </em>we need not wonder that this rule is strictly addressed to them. It may be added that, though God lays both on good and bad men the burden of the cross, yet unless they willingly bend their shoulders to it, they are not said to <em>bear the cross; </em>for a wild and refractory horse cannot be said to admit his rider, though he carries him. The patience of the saints, therefore, consists in <em>bearing </em>willingly <em>the cross </em>which has been laid on them. <span class="cite-ref">(466)</span> Luke adds the word <em>daily </em>— <em>let him take up his cross Daily </em>— which is very emphatic; for Christ’s meaning is, that there will be no end to our warfare till we leave the world. Let it be the uninterrupted exercise of the godly, that when many afflictions have run their course, they may be prepared to endure fresh afflictions. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(463)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A tous fideles</span>;” — “to all believers.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(464)</span> Harmony, vol. 1 p. 472. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(465)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour refuter l’imagination que Pierre avoit en son corveau</span>;” — “to refute the imagination which Peter had in his brain.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(466)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A porter la croix qua Dieu leur met sur les epaules</span>;” — “in bearing the cross which God lays on their shoulders.” </p></div></div>
