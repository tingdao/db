<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Have you not read? </em>Christ does not indeed reply directly to what was asked, but he fully meets the question which was proposed; just as if a person now interrogated about the Mass were to explain faithfully the mystery of the Holy Supper, and at length to conclude, that they are guilty of sacrilege and forgery who venture either to add or to take away any thing from the pure institution of the Lord, he would plainly overturn the pretended sacrifice of the Mass. Now Christ assumes as an admitted principle, that at the beginning God <em>joined the male to the female, </em>so that the two made an entire man; and therefore he who <em>divorces his wife </em>tears from him, as it were, the half of himself. But nature does not allow any man to tear in pieces his own body. </p><p>He adds another argument drawn from the less to the greater. The bond of marriage is more sacred than that which binds children to their parents. But piety binds children to their parents by a link which cannot be broken. Much less then can the husband renounce his wife. Hence it follows, that a chain which God made is burst asunder, if the husband divorce his wife. <span class="cite-ref">(594)</span></p><p>Now the meaning of the words is this: God, who created the human race, <em>made them male and female, </em>so that every man might be satisfied with his own wife, and might not desire more. For he insists on the number <em>two</em>, as the prophet Malachi, (<span class="bvs">Mal_2:15</span>,)when he remonstrates against polygamy, employs the same argument, that God, whose <em>Spirit was so abundant </em>that He had it in His power to create more, <em>yet made but one man, </em>that is, such a man as Christ here describes. And thus from the order of creation is proved the inviolable union of one husband with one wife. If it be objected, that in this way it will not be lawful, after the first wife is dead, to take another, the reply is easy, that not only is the bond dissolved by death, but the second wife is substituted by God in the room of the first, as if she had been one and the same woman. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(594)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que le mari qui se separe d’avecques sa femme rompt le lien dupuel Dieu estoit autheur</span>;” — “that the husband, who separates from his wife, bursts the chain of which God was the author.” </p></div></div>
