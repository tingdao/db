<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>And I am Jehovah thy God. </em>Again the Lord declares his power; for so great is the unbelief and sluggishness of men, that, although it is frequently declared, yet the very smallest temptation shews that they are not fully convinced of it. They quickly fall back upon themselves, when they are hard pressed by afflictions; and when they hear that anything is in the power of God, they do not think that it belongs to them. </p><p><em>Who divide the sea. </em>He does not speak in general terms, but brings forward the instance which he had often mentioned before; for, by once redeeming the fathers, he held out to posterity the hope of eternal salvation. Justly, therefore, does he exclaim that he is the same God who long ago “divided the sea;” and next he magnifies the miracle by saying that its roaring billows were stilled at his command. (<span class="bvs">Exo_14:21</span>.) We ought to know, therefore, that there are no raging billows which God cannot allay and calm in order to deliver his Church. “It is he who,” by his power, “stills the sea and makes it calm,” (<span class="bvs">Job_26:12</span>,) though it rage furiously; and he likewise drives and swells its waves, when he thinks fit; though literally, as I have remarked, the Prophet alludes to the history of the deliverance from Egypt. <span class="cite-ref">(30)</span></p><p><em>Jehovah of hosts. </em>The Lord is adorned with this title, that we may know how extensive is his power; and he exhibits that power as often as he is pleased to render assistance to his Church. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(30)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A l’histoire de la deliverance d’Egypte</span>.” </p></div></div>
