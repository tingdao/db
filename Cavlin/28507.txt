<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Every man in the calling in which. </em>This is the source from which other things are derived, — that every one should be contented with his <em>calling</em>, and pursue it, instead of seeking to betake himself to anything else. A <em>calling </em>in Scripture means a lawful mode of life, for it has a relation to God as <em>calling </em>us, <span class="cite-ref">(407)</span> — lest any one should abuse this statement <span class="cite-ref">(408)</span> to justify modes of life that are evidently wicked or vicious. But here it is asked, whether Paul means to establish any obligation, <span class="cite-ref">(409)</span> for it might seem as though the words conveyed this idea, that every one is bound to his <em>calling</em>, so that he must not abandon it. Now it were a very hard thing if a tailor <span class="cite-ref">(410)</span> were not at liberty to learn another trade, or if a merchant were not at liberty to betake himself to farming. I answer, that this is not what the Apostle intends, for he has it simply in view to correct that inconsiderate eagerness, which prompts some to change their condition without any proper reason, whether they do it from superstition, or from any other motive. Farther, he calls every one to this rule also — that they bear in mind what is suitable to their <em>calling </em>He does not, therefore, impose upon any one the necessity of continuing in the kind of life which he has once taken up, but rather condemns that restlessness, which prevents an individual from remaining in his condition with a peaceable mind <span class="cite-ref">(411)</span> and he exhorts, that every one stick by his trade, as the old proverb goes. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(407)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car d’autant que ce nom vient d’vn mot qui signifie </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Appeler</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, il ha vne correspondance mutuelle a Dieu, qui nous </span><em class="lang fr-fr">appelle </em><span class="lang fr-fr">a ceci ou a cela</span>;” — “For as this term comes from a word which signifies <em>to call</em>, it has a mutual relationship to God, who <em>calls </em>us to this or that.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(408)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceque ie di, afinque nul n’abuse ceste sentence</span>;” — “Which thing I say, in order that no one may abuse this statement.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(409)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vne obligation et necessite</span>;” — “An obligation and necessity.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(410)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vn cordonnier</span>;” — “A shoemaker.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(411)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Paisiblement, et en repos de conscience</span>;” — “Peaceably, and with quiet of conscience.” </p></div></div>
