<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Thou madest him, etc. </em>A new difficulty now arises as to the explanation of the words. I have already shown that the passage is fitly applicable to the Son of God; but the Apostle seems now to turn the words from that meaning in which David understood them; for <em>a little, </em><span class="lang el-gr">βραχύ τι </span> seems to refer to time, as it means a little while, and designates the abasement of Christ’s humiliation; and he confines the glory to the day of resurrection, while David extends it generally to the whole life of man. </p><p>To this I answer, that it was not the Apostle’s design to give an exact explanation of the words. For there is nothing improperly done, when verbal allusions are made to embellish a subject in hand, as Paul does in quoting a passage in <span class="bvs">Rom_10:6</span>, from Moses, “Who shall ascend into heaven,” <em>etc.</em>, he does not join the words “heaven and hell” for the purpose of explanation, but as ornaments. The meaning of David is this, — “O Lord, thou hast raised man to such a dignity, that it differs but little from divine or angelic honor; for he is set a ruler over the whole world.” This meaning the Apostle did not intend to overthrow, nor to turn to something else; but he only bids us to consider the abasement of Christ, which appeared for a short time, and then the glory with which he is perpetually crowned; and this he does more by alluding to expressions than by explaining what David understood. <span class="cite-ref">(35)</span></p><p>To be <em>mindful </em>and to <em>visit </em>mean the same thing, except that the second is somewhat fuller, for it sets forth the presence of God by the effect. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(35)</span> See Appendix G. </p></div></div>
