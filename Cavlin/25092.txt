<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Were filled with wrath </em>They perceived that the object of those two examples, which Christ had produced, was to show, that the grace of God would be removed from them to others: <span class="cite-ref">(327)</span> and therefore they considered that he had spoken to their dishonor. But, instead of having their consciences stung to the quick, and seeking a remedy for their vices by correcting them, they are only driven to madness. Thus ungodly men not only resist, with obstinacy, the judgments of God, but rise into cruelty against his servants. Hence it is evident, how forcible are the reproofs which proceed from the Spirit of God: for the minds of those who would willingly evade them, <span class="cite-ref">(328)</span> are inflamed with rage. Again, when we see that the minds of men are so envenomed, that they become mad against God, whenever they are treated with some degree of roughness, we ought to implore the Spirit of meekness, (<span class="bvs">Gal_5:23</span>,) that we may not be driven, by the same fury, into such a destructive war. <span class="cite-ref">(329)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(327)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que la grace de Dieu leur seroit ostee, et envoyee a autres</span>;” — “that the grace of God would be taken from them, and sent to others.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(328)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui les laisseroyent volontiers escouler sans y penser</span>;” — “who would willingly allow them to steal away, without thinking of them.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(329)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin que ne soyons transportez a entreprendre une guerre si folle, a nostre grande confusion</span>;” — “in order that we may not be hurried away, to undertake a war so foolish, to our great confusion.” </p></div></div>
