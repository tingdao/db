<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong>Luke hath hitherto declared that the Church was wonderfully increased, that it was furnished <span class="cite-ref">(254)</span> with divers gifts, that it excelled in miracles; finally, that the kingdom of Christ did flourish there by all means. Now he beginneth to show that the fury of the wicked was kindled with these things, so that they raged sorer afresh. <span class="cite-ref">(255)</span> Whence we may gather with what blind fury and rage Satan driveth them forward, when as they are so little terrified with such evident power of God, that they run headlong more boldly, and with greater force, and bend all their force, as it were, to overthrow the very heaven. As this so great blindness is a horrible punishment of Almighty God, so ought it to teach all men to submit themselves betimes to God, lest that they themselves, being taken with the spirit of giddiness, (whilst they run against the hand of God,) be broken in pieces with the same. Nevertheless, let us know that God will so increase his Church with spiritual good things, that yet, notwithstanding, he suffereth the same to be vexed of the wicked. Therefore we must alway be ready for the combat; for our estate at this day is not unlike to theirs. Especially the knowledge of the gifts of God, whereby he testifieth that he is present with us, ought to encourage us, lest the fury and boldness of the wicked do terrify and dismay us. For this is no small comfort, when we know that God is present with us. </p><p><em>Which were with him. </em>He meaneth those which were most familiar, and the highest linked in friendship with the chief priest, whose counsel he was wont to use, and whom he had, being, as it were, gathered and culled out of the whole order, not for judgment, or discretion, but for the love of his faction; as they did then contend among themselves shamelessly, like mortal enemies. Furthermore, Luke saith again, that the Sadducees did bear the greatest swing at that day; to the end we may know that the government was then confused with horrible wasteness; <span class="cite-ref">(256)</span> when as such a sect could bear rule. But God suffered the synagogue to be drowned in such extreme reproach, after that he had separated his Church from it, to the end they might have the less excuse, who despising the gospel, did continue in such a sink of filthiness. In the mean season, what did enforce and drive forward those swine, who were touched with no care of the life to come, save only mere ambition, and desire to keep that lordship and pre-eminence which they had gotten? </p><p><em>They were filled with zeal. </em>I had liefer keep the Greek word still (especially seeing it is common enough otherwise) than to translate it <em>emulation </em>(or <em>indignation;) </em>for he speaketh generally of the perverse and violent force wherewith hypocrites are carried and inflamed to maintain their superstitions; whereby it appeareth what account God maketh of zeal, and what praise it deserveth, when as it is not governed by reason and wisdom, that is, when it is not led and guided by the Spirit of God. We see at this day those men moved and stirred with devilish fury, who will be counted the most devout of all men, who rage horribly to shed innocent blood. Nevertheless, let us note that he speaketh not in this place of an unadvised or blind zeal, which was in many of the Jews, as Paul affirmeth, but we understand rather a hot and unbridled violence; for although the wicked be accused of their own consciences, because they wittingly resist godliness, yet do they deceive themselves with a false show of zeal, because it is lawful to prevent new things. <span class="cite-ref">(257)</span> So at this day almost in all Popery they boast only of zeal, whereas notwithstanding they are zealous for their belly. But admit we grant that that is true which they pretend, how can this excuse the heat of their cruelty whereunto they are enforced by their blindness? as if this were a chief virtue to grant liberty to their wrath, <span class="cite-ref">(258)</span> to be avenged of that which displeaseth them; but this was former in order, to make a difference between good and evil, lest any thing be dissolved <span class="cite-ref">(259)</span> unadvisedly. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(254)</span> “Magnifice ornatum,” magnificently furnished. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(255)</span> “Ut de integro violentius saevirent,” so that they anew become more violently enraged. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(256)</span> “Totem Ecclesiae gubernationem horrenda vastitate tunc fuisse confusam,” that the whole government of the Church was then confused and lying waste. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(257)</span> “Novis rebus,” a revolution. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(258)</span> “Frena iracundiae suae laxare,” to give loose reins to their wrath. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(259)</span> “Atqui hoc ordine prius erat, habere boni et mali discrimen, ne temere quicquam improbetur,” but the first thing in order was to observe the distinction between good and evil, that nothing might be rashly disapproved. </p></div></div>
