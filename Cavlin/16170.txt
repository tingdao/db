<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>His enemies will I clothe with shame. </em>The priests were said above “to be clothed with righteousness and salvation,” now the enemies of David are represented as “clothed with shame.” It is not enough that all go well within. God must keep us from the various harms and evils which come upon us from without, and hence we have this second promise added, which is one wherein we recognize often the goodness of God even more than in the blessings which he may shower upon us in the day of prosperity. The greater that fear which seizes upon us when exposed to aggression from enemies, the more are we sensibly awakened to take hold of divine help. The passage teaches us that the Church and people of God will never enjoy such peace on earth as altogether to escape being assaulted by the variety of enemies which Satan stirs up for their destruction. It is enough to have it declared, upon divine authority, that their attempts shall be unsuccessful, and that they will retire eventually with ignominy and disgrace. The, clause which follows has been variously interpreted. The verb which we have translated <em>to flourish, </em>in the Hiphil conjugation means sometimes <em>to see, </em>so that some have explained the words ­ In that place shall the crown of David be seen, when the horn shall have been made to bud. Some derive the word from <span class="lang he-il">ציף</span><em>, tsits, a plate, </em>as if it had been said that the crown of the king would be resplendent with plates of gold. But I consider that the crown is here said to <em>flourish, </em>just as formerly the allusion was to budding or germinating. Isaiah, on the other hand, speaks (<span class="bvs">Isa_28:5</span>) of the crown of drunkenness of Ephraim as being a fading flower. Thus we have it here declared that however frail to appearance the crown of David might be in his posterity, it would be invigorated by some secret virtue, and flourish for ever. </p></div>
