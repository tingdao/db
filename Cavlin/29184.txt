<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>But the fruit </em><span class="cite-ref">(93)</span><em>of the Spirit</em>. In the former part of the description he condemned the whole nature of man as producing nothing but evil and worthless fruits. He now informs us that all virtues, all proper and well regulated affections, proceed from the Spirit, that is, from the grace of God, and the renewed nature which we derive from Christ. As if he had said, “Nothing but what is evil comes from man; nothing good comes but from the Holy Spirit.” There have often appeared in unrenewed men remarkable instances of gentleness, integrity, temperance, and generosity; but it is certain that all were but specious disguises. Curius and Fabrieius were distinguished for courage, Cato for temperance, Scipio for kindness and generosity, Fabius for patience; but it was only in the sight of men, and as members of civil society, that they were so distinguished. In the sight of God nothing is pure but what proceeds from the fountain of all purity. </p><p><em>Joy </em>does not here, I think, denote that “joy in the Holy Ghost” (<span class="bvs">Rom_14:17</span>,) of which he speaks elsewhere, but that cheerful behavior towards our fellow-men which is the opposite of moroseness.<em>Faith </em>means truth, and is contrasted with cunning, deceit, and falsehood, as <em>peace </em>is with quarrels and contentions. <em>Long-suffering </em>is gentleness of mind, which disposes us to take everything in good part, and not to be easily offended. The other terms require no explanation, for the dispositions of the mind must be learned from the outward conduct. </p><p>But if spiritual men are known by their works, what judgment, it will be asked, shall we form of wicked men and idolaters, who exhibited an illustrious resemblance of all the virtues? for it is evident from their works that they were spiritual. I reply, as all the works of the flesh do not appear openly in a carnal man, but his carnaltry is discovered by one or another vice, so a single virtue will not entitle us to conclude that a man is spiritual. Sometimes it will be made evident, by other vices, that sin reigns in him; and this observation may be easily applied to all the cases which I have enumerated. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(93)</span> “In the service of <em>sin </em>the toil is so great that, in comparison thereof, the benefit is as nothing; in the service of <em>God </em>the benefit is so great that, in comparison thereof, the labour is as nothing. Where the flesh rules all, the ‘work’ exceeds the ‘fruit;’ and therefore, without even mentioning the ‘work,’ it is called the ‘fruit’ of the Spirit.
