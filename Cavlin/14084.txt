<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Every one of them has gone aside. </em>Some translate the word <span class="lang he-il">סר</span>, <em>sar, </em>which is here used, <em>to stink</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(282)</span> as if the reading were, <em>Every one of them emits an offensive odour, </em>that it may correspond in meaning with the verb in the next clause, which in Hebrew signifies <em>to become putrid </em>or <em>rotten. </em>But there is no necessity for explaining the two words in the same way, as if the same thing were repeated twice. The interpretation is more appropriate, which supposes that men are here condemned as guilty of a detestable revolt, inasmuch as they are estranged from God, or have departed far from him; and that afterwards there is pointed out the disgusting corruption or putrescence of their whole life, as if nothing could proceed from apostates but what smells rank of rottenness and infection. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">סר</span>, <em>sar, </em>is almost universally taken in this sense. In the 53<span class="cite-ref">rd</span> Psalm, the word <span class="lang he-il">סג</span><em>, sag, </em>is used, which signifies the same thing. In short, David declares that all men are so carried away by their capricious lusts, that nothing is to be found either of purity or integrity in their whole life. This, therefore, is defection so complete, that it extinguishes all godliness. Besides, David here not only censures a portion of the people, but pronounces them all to be equally involved in the same condemnation. This was, indeed, a prodigy well fitted to excite abhorrence, that all the children of Abraham, whom God had chosen to be his peculiar people, were so corrupt from the least to the greatest. </p><p>But it might be asked, how David makes no exception, how he declares that not a righteous person remains, <em>not even one, </em>when, nevertheless, he informs us, a little after, that the poor and afflicted put their trust in God? Again, it might be asked, if all were wicked, who was that Israel whose future redemption he celebrates in the end of the psalm? Nay, as he himself was one of the body of that people, why does he not at least except himself? I answer: It is against the carnal and degenerate body of the Israelitish nation that he here inveighs, and the small number constituting the seed which God had set apart for himself is not included among them. This is the reason why Paul, in his Epistle to the <span class="bvs">Rom_3:10</span>, extends this sentence to all mankind. David, it is true, deplores the disordered and desolate state of matters under the reign of Saul. At the same time, however, he doubtless makes a comparison between the children of God and all who have not been regenerated by the Spirit, but are carried away according to the inclinations of their flesh. <span class="cite-ref">(283)</span> Some give a different explanation, maintaining that Paul, by quoting the testimony of David, did not understand him as meaning that men are naturally depraved and corrupt; and that the truth which David intended to teach is, that the rulers and the more distinguished of the people were wicked, and that, therefore, it was not surprising to behold unrighteousness and wickedness prevailing so generally in the world. This answer is far from being satisfactory. The subject which Paul there reasons upon is not, what is the character of the greater part of men, but what is the character of all who are led and governed by their own corrupt nature. It is, therefore, to be observed, that when David places himself and the small remnant of the godly on one side, and puts on the other the body of the people, in general, this implies that there is a manifest difference between the children of God who are created anew by his Spirit, and all the posterity of Adam, in whom corruption and depravity exercise dominion. Whence it follows, that all of us, when we are born, bring with us from our mother’s womb this folly and filthiness manifested in the whole life, which David here describes, and that we continue such until God make us new creatures by his mysterious grace. </p><p><strong>(282)</strong><em>Hammond </em>admits that the word <span class="lang he-il">סר</span>, <em>sar, </em>means <em>to go aside, </em>or <em>to decline, </em>and that it is commonly applied to a way or path, declining from the right way, or going in a wrong way. But he thinks that the idea here is different, that it is taken from wine when it grows dead or sour, just as the word is used in this sense in <span class="bvs">Hos_4:18</span>, <span class="lang he-il">סר סבאם</span>, <em>sar sobim, </em>“Their drink is gone aside, or grown sour.” He considers this view corroborated from the clause which immediately follows, <span class="lang he-il">נאלחו</span>, <em>ne-elachu, they are become putrid, </em>which is derived from <span class="lang he-il">אלה</span>, <em>alach, to be rotten </em>or putrified, referring properly to flesh which has become putrid. “Thus,” says he, “the proportion is well kept between drink and meat, the one growing dead or sour, as the other putrifies and stinks, and then is good for nothing, but is thrown away.” </p><p><strong>(283)</strong> David speaks of all mankind, with the exception of the “people of God,” and “the generation of the righteous,” spoken of in verses 4, 5 who are opposed to the rest of the human race. </p></div>
