<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>60.</strong><em>This is a harsh saying. </em>On the contrary, it was in their hearts, and not in the <em>saying, </em>that the <em>harshness </em>lay. But out of the word of God the reprobate are thus accustomed to form stones to dash themselves upon, and when, by their hardened obstinacy, they rush against Christ, they complain that <em>his saying is harsh</em>, which ought rather to have softened them. For whoever shall submit with true humility <span class="cite-ref">(168)</span> to the doctrine of Christ will find nothing in it <em>harsh </em>or disagreeable; but to unbelievers, who oppose themselves with obstinacy, it will be <em>a hammer which breaketh the rocks in pieces</em>, as the Prophet calls it, (<span class="bvs">Jer_23:29</span>.) But since the same hardness is natural to us all, if we judge of the doctrine of Christ according to our feelings, his words will be just so many strange and incredible <span class="cite-ref">(169)</span> statements. All that remains for us, therefore, is, that every one commit himself to the guidance of the Spirit, that he may inscribe on our hearts what otherwise would never have even entered into our ears. </p><p><em>Who can hear it? </em>Here we see the awful wickedness of unbelief; for they who impiously and basely reject the doctrine of salvation, not satisfied with excusing themselves, have the hardihood to put the Son of God in their room as if he were guilty, and to declare that he is unworthy of being <em>heard </em>Thus, in the present day, Papists not only reject the Gospel in a daring manner, but likewise break out into horrid blasphemies, that it may not be thought that they have no good reason for opposing God. And, indeed, since they desire darkness, we need not wonder if Satan deceives them by strange monsters, where there is nothing but the open highway. <span class="cite-ref">(170)</span> But that which they, through their rage and fury, cannot endure will not only be tolerable to modest and teachable persons, but will support and comfort them. Yet the reprobate, by their obstinate slanders, will do nothing more than bring down on themselves more dreadful condemnation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(168)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En vraye humilite</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(169)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estranges et incroyables</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(170)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La ou il n’y a que le beau plein chemin</span>.” </p></div></div>
