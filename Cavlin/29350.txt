<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Wherefore take unto you. </em>Though our enemy is so powerful, Paul does not infer that we must throw away our spears, but that we must prepare our minds for the battle. A promise of victory is, indeed, involved in the exhortation, <em>that ye may be able. </em>If we only <em>put on the whole armor of God, </em>and fight valiantly to the end, we shall certainly <em>stand. </em>On any other supposition, we would be discouraged by the number and variety of the contests; and therefore he adds, <em>in the evil day. </em>By this expression he rouses them from security, bids them prepare themselves for hard, painful, and dangerous conflicts, and, at the same time, animates them with the hope of victory; for amidst the greatest dangers they will be safe. <em>And having done all. </em>They are thus directed to cherish confidence through the whole course of life. There will be no danger which may not be successfully met by the power of God; nor will any who, with this assistance, fight against Satan, fail in the day of battle. </p></div>
