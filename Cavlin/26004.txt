<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_24:12</span><strong>.</strong><em>And Peter arose, and ran to the tomb. </em>I have no doubt that Luke here inverts the order of the narrative, as may be readily inferred from the words of John, (<span class="bvs">Joh_20:3</span>;) and, in my opinion, the word <em>ran </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">ἔδραμεν</span>) might justly be rendered as a pluperfect tense, <em>had run. </em>All who possess a tolerable acquaintance with Scripture are aware that it is customary with Hebrew writers to relate afterwards those occurrences which had been omitted in their proper place. Luke mentions this circumstance for the purpose of showing more strongly the obstinacy of the apostles ill despising the words of the women, when Peter had already seen the empty grave, and had been compelled to <em>wonder at </em>an evident proof of the resurrection. </p></div>
