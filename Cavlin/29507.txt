<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And you, when ye were dead. </em>He admonishes the Colossians to recognize, what he had treated of in a general way, as applicable to themselves, which is by far the most effectual way of teaching. Farther, as they were Gentiles when they were converted to Christ, he takes occasion from this to shew them how absurd it is to pass over from Christ to the ceremonies of Moses. <em>Ye were</em>, says he, <em>dead in Uncircumcision</em>. This term, however, may be understood either in its proper signification, or figuratively. If you understand it in its proper sense, the meaning will be, “<em>Uncircumcision </em>is the badge of alienation from God; for where the covenant of grace is not, <em>there </em>is pollution, <span class="cite-ref">(376)</span> and, consequently, curse and ruin. But God has called you to himself from <em>uncircumcision</em>, and, therefore, from death.” <span class="cite-ref">(377)</span> In this way he would not represent <em>uncircumcision </em>as the cause of death, but as a token that they were estranged from God. We know, however, that men cannot live otherwise than by cleaving to their God, who alone is their life. Hence it follows, that all wicked persons, however they may seem to themselves to be in the highest degree lively and flourishing, are, nevertheless, spiritually dead. In this manner this passage will correspond with <span class="bvs">Eph_2:11</span>, where it is said, </p><p>Remember that, in time past, when ye were Gentiles, and called uncircumcision, by that circumcision which is made with hands in the flesh, ye were at that time without Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the promises. </p><p>Taking it metaphorically, there would, indeed, be an allusion to natural uncircumcision, but at the same time Paul would here be speaking of the obstinacy of the human heart, in opposition to God, and of a nature that is defiled by corrupt affections. I rather prefer the former exposition, because it corresponds better with the context; for Paul declares that uncircumcision was no hinderance in the way of their becoming partakers of Christ’s life. Hence it follows, that circumcision derogated from the grace of God, which they had already obtained. </p><p>As to his ascribing death to uncircumcision, this is not as though it were the cause of it, but as being the badge of it, as also in that other passage in the Epistle to the Ephesians, which we have quoted. It is also customary in Scripture to denote deprivation of the reality by deprivation of the sign, as in <span class="bvs">Gen_3:22</span>, — </p><p>Lest peradventure Adam eat of the fruit of life, and live. </p><p>For the tree did not confer life, but its being taken away was a sign of death. <span class="cite-ref">(378)</span> Paul has in this place briefly expressed both. He says that these were <em>dead in sins</em>: this is the cause, for our sins alienate us from God. He adds, <em>in the uncircumcision of your flesh. </em>This was outward pollution, an evidence of spiritual death. </p><p><em>By forgiving you. </em>God does not quicken us by the mere remission of sins, but he makes mention here of this particularly, because that free reconciliation with God, which overthrows the righteousness of works, is especially connected with the point in hand, where he treats of abrogated ceremonies, as he discourses of more at large in the Epistle to the Galatians. For the false apostles, by establishing ceremonies, bound them with a halter, from which Christ has set them free. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(376)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Là il n’y a que souillure et ordure</span>;” — “There, there is nothing but filth and pollution.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(377)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il vous a donc retirez de la mort</span>;” — “He has, therefore, drawn you back from death.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(378)</span> See Calvin on Genesis, vol. 1, p. 184. </p></div></div>
