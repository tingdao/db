<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24</strong><em>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down </em>This verse has generally been interpreted proverbially, and as meaning, that though the righteous may fall into sin, his fall is not deadly; but this is not at all in accordance with the design of the prophet, who is discoursing of the happiness of the godly. The simple meaning is, that when God visits his servants with severe afflictions, he at the same time mitigates them that they may not faint under them; <span class="cite-ref">(40)</span> as Paul declares, </p><p>“We are persecuted, but not forsaken; <LineBreak />cast down, but not destroyed.”— (<span class="bvs">2Co_4:9</span>) </p><p>Some say that the righteous are not utterly cast down, because they lose not their courage, but rather bear with invincible fortitude whatever burden is laid upon them. I readily admit that the reason why they are not overwhelmed is, that they are not so tender and delicate as to sink under the burden. I, however, understand the words in a more extensive sense, and explain them thus: That the miseries of the godly are so tempered with God’s fatherly mercy, that they fail not under their burden, and even when they fall, sink not into destruction. From these words we learn that the godly, although they serve God sincerely, and study to lead a blameless life, are not suffered to continue unmoved, and always in the same condition, but are often afflicted and cast down by various trials; and that the only difference between them and the unbelieving is, that their falls are not deadly. We know that if God smite the reprobate, though it be but very slightly, it becomes the cause of their final destruction. Solomon speaks still more expressly when he says, </p><p>“For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Pro_24:16</span>,) </p><p>and by these words he teaches us, that the godly are not only subjected to frequent afflictions in this life, but that they are visited with daily trials, and yet are never forsaken of the Lord. We must also shortly observe, that even the slightest fall would be enough to destroy us utterly, did not God uphold us by his hand. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(40)</span> “Neither the text,” says Dr Adam Clarke, “nor any of the versions, intimate that a falling into sin is meant; but a falling into <em>trouble</em>, <em>difficulty</em>, ” etc. </p></div></div>
