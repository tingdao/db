<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_8:24</span><strong>.</strong><em>I see men. </em>Our Lord had put the question to <em>the blind man </em>for the sake of his disciples, to inform them that the man had received something, but that hitherto nothing more than a slight commencement of the cure had been effected. The reply is, that he <em>sees men</em>, because he perceives some persons <em>walking </em>who are upright <em>like trees </em>By these words he acknowledges that his sight is not yet so clear as to distinguish <em>men </em>from <em>trees</em>, but that he has already obtained some power of seeing, because he conjectures from the motion that those whom he perceives to be in an erect posture are men; and it is in this respect that he says they are <em>like trees </em>We see then that he speaks only by conjecture when he says that he <em>sees men </em></p></div>
