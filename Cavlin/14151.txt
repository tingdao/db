<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>It is God who hath girded. </em>This is a metaphor taken either from the belt or girdle of a warrior, or from the reins, in which the Scripture sometimes places a manâ€™s vigor or strength. It is, therefore, as if he had said, I, who would otherwise have been feeble and effeminate, have been made strong and courageous by the power of God. He afterwards speaks of the success itself with which God had favored him; for it would not be enough for persons to have prompt and active courage, nor even to excel in strength, if their undertakings were not at the same time crowned with a prosperous issue. Irreligious men imagine that this proceeds from their own prudence, or from fortune; but David ascribes it to God alone: <em>It is God who hath made my way perfect. </em>The word <em>way </em>is here to be understood of the course of our actions, and the language implies, that whatever David undertook, God, by his blessing, directed it to a successful issue. </p></div>
