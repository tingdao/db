<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>But though I am rude </em>There was one thing <span class="cite-ref">(814)</span> in which he might appear, at first view, to be inferior — that he was devoid of eloquence. This judgment, <span class="cite-ref">(815)</span> therefore, he anticipates and corrects, while he <em>acknowledges </em>himself, indeed, to be <em>rude </em>and unpolished <em>in speech, </em>while at the same time he maintains that he has <em>knowledge </em>By <em>speech </em>here he means, elegance of expression; and by <em>knowledge </em>he means, the very substance of doctrine. For as man has both a soul and a body, so also in doctrine, there is the thing itself that is taught, and the ornament of expression with which it is clothed. Paul, therefore, maintains that he understands, what should be taught, and what is necessary to be known, though he is not an eloquent orator, so as to know how to set off his doctrine by a polished and eloquent manner of expression. </p><p>It is asked, however, whether elegance of <em>speech </em><span class="cite-ref">(816)</span> is not also necessary for Apostles; for how will they otherwise be prepared for teaching? <em>Knowledge </em>might perhaps suffice for others, but how could a teacher be dumb? I answer, that, while Paul acknowledges himself to be <em>rude in speech, </em>it is not as though he were a mere infant, but as meaning, that he was not distinguished by such splendid eloquence as others, to whom he yields the palm as to this, retaining for himself what was the principal thing — the reality itself, <span class="cite-ref">(817)</span> while he leaves them talkativeness without gravity. If, however, any one should inquire, why it is that the Lord, <em>who made men’s tongues, </em>(<span class="bvs">Exo_4:11</span>,) did not also endow so eminent an apostle with eloquence, that nothing might be wanting to him, I answer, that he was furnished with a <em>sufficiency </em>for supplying the want of eloquence. For we see and feel, what majesty there is in his writings, what elevation appears in them, what a weight of meaning is couched under them, what power is discovered in them. In fine, they are thunderbolts, not mere words. Does not the efficacy of the Spirit appear more clearly in a naked rusticity of words, (so to speak,) than under the disguise of elegance and ornament? Of this matter, however, we have treated more largely in the former Epistle. <span class="cite-ref">(818)</span> In short, he admits, as far as words are concerned, what his adversaries allege by way of objection, while he denies in reality what they hold forth. Let us also learn, from his example, to prefer deeds to words, and, to use a barbarous but common proverb — “Teneant alii quid <em>nominis, </em>nos autem quid <em>rei </em>;” — “Let others know something of the <em>name, </em>but let us know something of the <em>reality. </em>” <span class="cite-ref">(819)</span> If eloquence is superadded, let it be regarded by us as something over and above; and farther, let it not be made use of for disguising doctrine, or adulterating it, but for unfolding it in its genuine simplicity. </p><p><em>But everywhere. </em>As there was something magnificent in placing himself on a level with the chief Apostles, that this may not be ascribed to arrogance, he makes the Corinthians judges, provided they judge from what they have themselves experienced; for they had known sufficiently well, from many proofs, that he did not boast needlessly, or without good reason. He means, therefore, that he needs not make use of words, inasmuch as reality and experience afford clear evidence of every thing that he was about to say <span class="cite-ref">(820)</span></p><p><strong>(814)</strong><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’y auoit que ceci seul</span>;” — “There was only this one thing.” </p><p><strong>(815)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce fol iugement</span>;” — “This foolish judgment.” </p><p><strong>(816)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La faculte de bien parler et auec grace</span>;” — “The power of speaking well and gracefully.” </p><p><strong>(817)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La substance de la chose</span>;” — “The substance of the thing.” </p><p><strong>(818)</strong> See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, pp. 75-77. </p><p><strong>(819)</strong><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Et afin que i’vse d’vn prouerbe des Latins barbare, commun toutesfois — ‘Que les autres scachent les mots, mais que nous ayons bonne cognoissance de la chose</span>;’” — “And to use a proverb of the Latins, barbarous, indeed, but common — ‘Let others know the words, but let us have a good acquaintance with the reality.’” Tymme, in his translation of Calvin on the Corinthians, (1573,) renders this proverb as follows: “Let other haue the shell, so we may haue the kernell.” — Ed. </p><p><strong>(820)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Monstrent audoigttout ce qu’il en pourroit dire</span>;” — “Show with the finger every thing that he might be prepared to say as to it.” </p></div>
