<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Who are Israelites, etc. </em>Here the reason is now more plainly given, why the destruction of that people caused him so much anguish, that he was prepared to redeem them by his own death, namely because they were Israelites; for the relative pronoun is put here instead of a causative adverb. In like manner this anxiety took hold on Moses, when he desired that he should be blotted out of the book of life, rather than that the holy and chosen race of Abraham should be reduced to nothing. (<span class="bvs">Exo_32:32</span>.) Then in addition to his kind feeling, he mentions also other reasons, and those of a higher kind, which made him to favor the Jews, even because the Lord had, as it were, by a kind of privilege, so raised them, that they were separated from the common order of men: and these titles of dignity were testimonies of love; for we are not wont to speak thus favorably, but of those whom we love. And though by their ingratitude they rendered themselves unworthy to be esteemed on account of these gifts of God, yet Paul continued justly to respect them, that he might teach us that the ungodly cannot so contaminate the good endowments of God, but that they always deserve to be praised and admired: at the same time, those who abuse them acquire thereby nothing but a greater obloquy. But as we are not to act in such a manner as to contemn, through a detestation of the ungodly, the gifts of God in them; so, on the other hand, we must use prudence, lest by our kind esteem and regard for them we make them proud, and especially lest our praises bear the appearance of flattery. But let us imitate Paul, who conceded to the Jews their privileges in such a manner, that he afterwards declared that they were all of no worth without Christ. But it was not in vain that he mentioned this as one of their praises, — that they were <em>Israelites; </em>for Jacob prayed for this as a great favor, that they should be called by his name. (<span class="bvs">Gen_48:16</span>.) </p><p><em>Whose are the adoption, etc. </em>The whole drift of Paul’s discourse is to this purpose, — that though the Jews by their defection had produced an ungodly divorce between God and themselves, yet the light of God’s favor was not wholly extinguished, according to what he had also said in <span class="bvs">Rom_3:3</span>. They had indeed become unbelievers and had broken his covenant; but still their perfidy had not rendered void the faithfulness of God; for he had not only reserved for himself some remnant seed from the whole multitude, but had as yet continued, according to their hereditary right, the mime of a Church among them. </p><p>But though they had already stripped themselves of these ornaments, so that it availed them nothing to be called the children of Abraham, yet as there was a danger, lest through their fault the majesty of the gospel should be depreciated among the Gentiles, Paul does not regard what they deserved, but covers their baseness and disgraceful conduct by throwing vails over them, until the Gentiles were fully persuaded, that the gospel had flowed to them from the celestial fountain, from the sanctuary of God, from an elect nation. For the Lord, passing by other nations, had selected them as a people peculiar to himself, and had adopted them as his children, as he often testifies by Moses and the prophets; and not content simply to give them the name of children, he calls them sometimes his first-begotten, and sometimes his beloved. So the Lord says in <span class="bvs">Exo_4:22</span>, — </p><p>“My first-begotten son is Israel; let my son go, <LineBreak />that he may serve me.” </p><p>In <span class="bvs">Jer_31:9</span>, it is said, </p><p>“I am become a Father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-begotten:” </p><p>and again, “Is not my son Ephraim precious to me? Is he not a delightful child? Hence troubled for him are my bowels, and I will yet pity him.” By these words he means, not only to set forth his kindness towards the people of Israel, but rather to exhibit the <em>efficacy </em>of adoption, through which the promise of the celestial inheritance is conveyed. </p><p><em>Glory </em>means the excellency into which the Lord had raised up that people above all other nations, and that in many and various ways, and especially by dwelling in the midst of them; for besides many other tokens of his presence, he exhibited a singular proof of it in the ark, where he gave responses, and also heard his people, that he might show forth his power in helping them: and for this reason it was called “the glory of God.” (<span class="bvs">1Sa_4:22</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(287)</span></p><p>As he has distinguished here between <em>covenants </em><span class="cite-ref">(288)</span> and <em>promises, </em>we may observe this difference, — that a covenant is that which is expressed in distinct and accustomed words, and contains a mutual stipulation, as that which was made with Abraham; but promises are what we meet with everywhere in Scripture; for when God had once made a covenant with his ancient people, he continued to offer, often by new promises, his favor to them. It hence follows, that promises are to be traced up to the covenant as to their true source; in the same manner as the special helps of God, by which he testifies his love towards the faithful, may be said to flow from the true fountain of election. And as the law was nothing more than a renewal of the covenant, and more fully sanctioned the remembrance of it, <em>legislation, </em>or the giving of the law, seems to be here peculiarly applied to the things which the law decreed: for it was no common honor conferred on the Jewish people, that they had God as their lawgiver. For if some gloried in their Solons and Lycurguses, how much more reason was there to glory in the Lord? of this you have an account in <span class="bvs">Deu_4:32</span>. By <em>worship </em>he understands that part of the law in which the legitimate manner of worshipping God is prescribed, such as rites and ceremonies. These ought to have been deemed lawful on account of God’s appointment; without which, whatever men devise is nothing but a profanation of religion. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(287)</span><em>Vitriaga </em>thinks that “the glory” was the pillar of fire and the cloud in the wilderness: but [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] <em>, </em>and [<span class="bvs">Hammond </span>] agree with [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] <em>, </em>that the ark is meant. See <span class="bvs">Psa_78:61</span>. It seems to refer to those manifestations made in the tabernacle, and afterwards in the temple, by peculiar brightness or splendour. See <span class="bvs">Exo_40:34</span>. This splendour or glory signified God’s presence, a privilege peculiar to the Israelites. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(288)</span> Why he mentions “covenants<span class="lang el-gr">,” αἱ διαθὢκαι</span><em>, </em>in the plural number, has been variously accounted for, — “there were various things included — the land of Canaan, prosperity, and the priesthood, — there were three laws — the moral, ceremonial, and judicial, — there were several repetitions of the covenant made to the patriarchs;” but if we read <span class="bvs">Gal_3:17</span>, we shall see the true reason, for the Apostle there makes a distinct difference between the Abrahamic and the Mosaic covenant; but both these belonged to the Jews. See also <span class="bvs">Eph_2:12</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
