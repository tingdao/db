<div class="comment-content"><p>Now, why he names the <em>house of Levi</em>, and the <em>house of Shimei</em>, or <em>of Simeon</em>, and the <em>house of David</em>, and <em>the house of Nathan</em>, rather than the other tribes, is uncertain: yet it seems to me probable that by the family of David he means the whole tribe of Judah, and the same by the family of Nathan. As to the tribe of Levi it excelled in honor on account of the priesthood, but no honor belonged to Simeon. Why then are Issachar and Reuben the first-born, and the other tribes omitted here? It might indeed have been, that there were then remaining more from the tribes of Simeon and Levi than from the tribe of Zebulon or of Issachar or of Reuben; but this is uncertain, and I am not disposed to make much of mere conjectures. But I am inclined to think that the family of David and the tribe of Levi are here mentioned not for the sake of honor but of reproach, because the royal family and the priests were those who crucified Christ, and pierced God in the person of his only-begotten Son. <em>Jerome </em>conjectures, that the family of Nathan is named, because he was a celebrated Prophet and eminent above others, and that the Prophets are designated by him. He says that many teachers arose from the tribe of Simeon; but I know not where he got his information, for he adduces no proofs. <span class="cite-ref">(166)</span></p><p>But I am satisfied with the simple view already given, — that the Prophet by mentioning certain families meant to include the whole people, and that he does not omit the royal family nor the priests, because they were especially those who crucified Christ: and we know that Christ descended from Nathan, though Jerome thought the Prophet to be intended here rather than Nathan, one of Christ’s progenitors: but these things are of small moment. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(166)</span> What he says in substance is, that the family of David represented the royal order — of Nathan, the prophetic — of Levi, the sacerdotal — and of Simeon, the order of teachers, as from that tribe many of them had proceeded. The same view was taken by <em>Theodoret </em>and <em>Cyril</em>. It was thought by <em>Marckius </em>that Nathan the son of David is meant, who represented, not the royal line, but his other descendants, and that Shimei belonged to the tribe of Levi, and represented the Levites, not the priestly line; see <span class="bvs">Num_3:18</span>; and <em>Henderson’s </em>view is the same. But <em>Blayney </em>though that they were all the progenitors of our Savior. <span class="bvs">Luk_3:29</span>. </p><p>Instead of “Shimei,” the <em>Septuagint</em>, the <em>Arabic</em>, and <em>Syriac</em>, have a “Simeon,” which <em>Newcome</em>, adopts as the true reading. Three MS., the <em>Syriac</em>, and the <em>Targum</em>, supply “house” before it. </p><p>Was not this prophecy literally fulfilled in the time of Ezra? His return, and the reformation he effected, were several years <em>posterior </em>to the time when this prophecy was delivered. The brief account, given in the ninth and tenth chapters of Ezra, clearly intimates a state of things similar to what is here described. See especially <span class="bvs">Ezr_9:1</span>; and the names of those who had transgressed, <span class="bvs">Ezr_10:20</span>. The priestly line of Levi and those of inferior order are mentioned, and also those “of Israel,” denominated “princes and rulers” in <span class="bvs">Ezr_9:2</span>. We hence see a reason for the lamentation of the “wives,” and these apart. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
