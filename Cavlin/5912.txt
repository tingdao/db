<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>l.</strong><em>And it came to pass, </em>etc The brief and obscure allusion previously made with regard to the twelve men he now explains more at length. He had said that they were chosen by the order of God, one each from his own tribe; but breaking off his discourse, he had not mentioned for what purpose. He now says, that by command of Joshua <span class="cite-ref">(47)</span> they took up twelve stones and placed them in Gilgal, that a well marked memorial might exist among posterity. Moreover, as he only relates what was done after the passage of the people, what is interposed should be interpreted as in the pluperfect tense. <span class="cite-ref">(48)</span> It is also very obvious that the copula is used instead of the rational particle. <span class="cite-ref">(49)</span> The substance is, that before the priests moved their foot from the middle of the river where they stood, the stones at their feet were taken and placed in Gilgal, to be perpetual witnesses of the miracle, and that Joshua thus faithfully executed what God had commanded. Joshua, therefore, called the men whom he had previously chosen, but not without the command of God, that through it he might have a stronger attestation to his authority. For had Joshua raised up a trophy of that kind of his own accord, the piety which dictated it might indeed have been laudable, but the admonition founded only on the will of man might perhaps have been despised. But now when God himself raises the sign, it is impious to pass it carelessly by. He intimates, accordingly, that it was a monument deserving of the greatest attention when he introduces the children asking, what mean these stones? </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(47)</span> “Joshua.” Apparently a misprint for “Jehovah;” as the French says more accurately, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le commandment de Dieu</span>;” “The command of God.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(48)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par un temps passe plus que parfait (comme parlent les Latins;)</span> “ “By a past time more than perfect, (as the Latins speak.)” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(49)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et quant a ce mot </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Et</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, on peut aisement juger qu’il se prend pour </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Car </em>;” And as to this word <em>And</em>, we may easily judge that it is taken for <em>For</em>. ” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
