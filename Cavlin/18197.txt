<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And I will camp against thee round about. </em>By the word <span class="lang he-il">כדור</span> (<em>kāddūr</em>) <span class="cite-ref">(257)</span> he alludes to the roundness of a ball; and the expression corresponds to one commonly used, (“<span class="lang fr-fr">Je l’environneray</span>,”) “I shall surround it.” Thus he shews that all means of escape will be cut off. </p><p><em>And will lay siege against thee. </em>This alludes to another method of invading the city; for either attacks are made at various points, or there is a regular siege. He confirms the doctrine of the former verse, and shews that this war will be carried on under God’s direction, and that the Assyrians, though they are hurried on by their passions and by the lust of power, will undertake nothing but by the command of God. He reckoned it to be of great importance to carry full conviction to the minds of the Jews, that all the evils which befell them were sent by God, that they might thus be led to enter into an examination of their crimes. As this doctrine is often found in the Scriptures, it ought to be the more carefully impressed on our minds; for it is not without good reason that it is so frequently repeated and inculcated by the Holy Spirit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(257)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
