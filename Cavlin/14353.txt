<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Blessed be Jehovah! </em>These general truths the Psalmist here proceeds to apply to his own circumstances, and he declares that the goodness of God in preserving his life was wondrously displayed. As he speaks of aid which had been suddenly and unexpectedly afforded him in very desperate circumstances, those interpreters judge aright who here supply <em>as, </em>the mark of similitude, <span class="cite-ref">(653)</span> in this way, <em>as in a fortified city </em>David lay open to every blow, and had been exposed to every sort of injury, and he boasts that in his nakedness and destitution the assistance of God had been of greater service to him than a city well fortified, or an impregnable fortress would have been. </p><p><strong>(653)</strong> “The particle of similitude is wanting in Hebrew, as is not uncommon. The intention of the Psalmist is evidently to describe by a metaphor his signal deliverance, as if he had been guarded by invincible fortifications.” — <em>Walford. </em></p></div>
