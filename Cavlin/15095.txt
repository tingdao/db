<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>My voice came to God, and I cried. </em>This is not a mere complaint, as some interpreters explain it, denoting the surprise which the people of God felt in finding that he who hitherto had been accustomed to grant their requests shut his ears to them, and was called upon in vain. It appears more probable that the prophet either speaks of the present feeling of his mind, or else calls to remembrance how he had experienced that God was inclined and ready to hear his prayers. There can be no doubt that he describes the greatness of the sorrow with which he was afflicted; and, in nay opinion, he denotes a continued act both by the past and the future tenses of the verbs. In the first place, he declares that he did not foolishly rend the air with his cries, like many who pour forth bitter cries without measure and at random under their sorrows; but that he addressed his speech to God when necessity constrained him to cry. The copula <em>and, </em>which is joined to the verb <em>cried, </em>should be resolved into the adverb of time <em>when, </em>in this way, <em>When I cried my voice came to God </em>At the same time, he also shows, that although he had been constrained often to reiterate his cries, he had not given over persevering in prayer. What is added immediately after is intended for the confirmation of his faith: <em>And he heard me. </em>The copula <em>and, </em>as in many other places, is here put instead of the causal adverb <em>for. </em>The meaning is, that he encouraged himself to cry to God, from the consideration that it was Godâ€™s usual manner to show his favor and mercy towards him. </p></div>
