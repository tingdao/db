<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25</strong><em>The perfect law of liberty</em>. After having spoken of empty speculation, he comes now to that penetrating intuition which transforms us to the image of God. And as he had to do with the Jews, he takes the word <em>law</em>, familiarly known to them, as including the whole truth of God. </p><p>But why he calls it <em>a perfect law</em>, and <em>a law of liberty</em>, interpreters have not been able to understand; for they have not perceived that there is here a contrast, which may be gathered from other passages of Scripture. As long as the law is preached by the external voice of man, and not inscribed by the finger and Spirit of God on the heart, it is but a dead letter, and as it were a lifeless thing. It is, then, no wonder that the law is deemed imperfect, and that it is the law of bondage; for as Paul teaches in <span class="bvs">Gal_4:24</span>, separated from Christ, it generates to condemn and as the same shews to us in <span class="bvs">Rom_8:13</span>, it can do nothing but fill us with diffidence and fear. But the Spirit of regeneration, who inscribes it on our inward parts, brings also the grace of adoption. It is, then, the same as though James had said, “The teaching of the law, let it no longer lead you to bondage, but, on the contrary, bring you to liberty; let it no longer be only a schoolmaster, but bring you to perfection: it ought to be received by you with sincere affection, so that you may lead a godly and a holy life.” </p><p>Moreover, since it is a blessing of the Old Testament that the law of God should reform us, as it appears from <span class="bvs">Jer_31:33</span>, and other passages, it follows that it cannot be obtained until we come to Christ. And, doubtless, he alone is the end and perfection of the law; and James adds <em>liberty</em>, as an inseparable associate, because the Spirit of Christ never regenerates but that he becomes also a witness and an earnest of our divine adoption, so as to free our hearts from fear and trembling. </p><p><em>And continueth</em>. This is firmly to persevere in the knowledge of God; and when he adds, <em>this man shall be blessed in his deed</em>, or work, he means that blessedness is to be found in doing, not in cold hearing. <span class="cite-ref">(111)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(111)</span> It may be rendered thus, — “The same shall be blessed in (or by) the doing of it,” that is, the work. The very doing of the law of liberty, of what the gospel prescribes, makes a man blessed or happy. </p></div></div>
