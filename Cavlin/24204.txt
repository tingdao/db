<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_28:8</span><strong>.</strong><em>And they departed quickly. </em>The three Evangelists pass by what John relates about Mary Magdalene, (<span class="bvs">Joh_20:2</span>,) that she returned into the city before she had seen the angels, and complained with tears that the body of Christ had been taken away. Here they mention only the second return to the city, when she, and other women who accompanied her, <em>told the disciples that Christ was risen; </em>which they had learned both from the words and testimony of the angel, and from seeing Christ himself. Now before Christ showed himself, they already <em>ran to the disciples, </em>as they had been commanded by the angel. On the road they received a second confirmation, that they might with greater certainty assert the resurrection of the Lord. </p><p><em>With fear and great joy. </em>By these words Matthew means that they were indeed gladdened by what the angel told them, but, at the same the were struck <em>with fear, </em>so that they were held in suspense between joy and perplexity. For there are sometimes opposite feelings in the hearts of the godly, which move them alternately in opposite directions, until at length the peace of the Spirit brings them into a settled condition. For if their faith had been strong, it would have given them entire composure by subduing <em>fear; </em>but now <em>fear, </em>mingled with <em>joy, </em>shows that they had not yet fully relied on the testimony of the angel. And here Christ exhibited a remarkable instance of compassion, in meeting them while they thus doubted and trembled, so as to remove all remaining doubt. </p><p>Yet there is some diversity in the words of Mark, that <em>they fled, seized with trembling and amazement, </em>so that through fear they were dismayed. But the solution is not very difficult; for though they were resolved to obey the angel, still they had not power to do so, <span class="cite-ref">(307)</span> if the Lord himself had not loosed their tongues. But in what follows there is greater appearance of contradiction; for Mark does not say that Christ met them, but only that <em>he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, </em>while Luke says nothing whatever of this <em>appearance. </em>But this omission ought not to appear strange to us, since it is far from being unusual with the Evangelists. </p><p>As to the difference between the words of Matthew and of Mark, it is possible that <em>Magdalene </em>may have been a partaker of so great a favor before the other women, or even that Matthew, by synecdoche, may have extended to all what was peculiar to one of their number. It is more probable, however, that Mark names her alone, because she first obtained a sight of Christ, and in a peculiar manner, in preference to the others, and yet that her companions also saw Christ in their order, and that on this account Matthew attributes it to all them in common. This was an astonishing instance of goodness<em>, </em>that Christ manifested his heavenly glory to a wretched woman, <em>who had been possessed by seven devils</em>, (<span class="bvs">Luk_8:2</span>,) and, intending to display the light of a new and eternal life, began where there was nothing in the eyes of man but what was base and contemptible. But by this example Christ showed how generously he is wont to continue the progress of his grace, when he has once displayed it towards us; and, at the same time, he threw down the pride of the flesh. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(307)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Toutesfois le moyen leur defailloit, et elles n’eussent sceu le faire</span>;” — “yet they wanted the means, and would not have known how to do it.” </p></div></div>
