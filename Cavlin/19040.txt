<div class="comment-content"><p><em>And come, </em>he says, <em>unto me </em>God, I doubt not, speaks here. Some think that the Prophet here represents the whole body of the people; and they consider them as saying, that there would come a wind which would rush on themselves. But this is too strained; and further, this explanation is disproved by the context: nor can what follows be applied to the Prophet, <em>I will now pronounce judgments against them </em>Here then God, in his office as a judge, declares that a wind was nigh, by which he would dissipate and overthrow the whole of Judea, and would no more cleanse it. And thus he shews, that the Chaldeans would not of themselves come, but would be sent to execute his orders; as though he had said, — that he would be the author of those calamities which were impending over the Jews: <em>come, </em>then, <em>shall wind unto me; </em>that is, it will be ready to obey my orders. </p><p>And he adds at last, by way of an exposition, <em>I will then speak judgments with them </em>To speak judgments is to execute the office of a judge, or to call to judgment, or to summon men to declare their cause, as kings are said to speak judgments when they constrain the guilty to render an account, of themselves. God briefly intimates, that he had hitherto exercised great forbearance towards the Jews; but that as he found that his indulgence availed nothing, except that they became more and more ferocious, he declares, that he would now become their judge to punish their wickedness. <span class="cite-ref">(108)</span> He afterwards adds — </p><p><strong>(108)</strong> The <em>Septuagint </em>version of these two verses is as foreign to the original as it can well be; and the <em>Syriac </em>and <em>Arabic </em>are nearly the same. The <em>Vulgate </em>gives a fair version; and the meaning, as given by the <em>Targum, </em>is nearly the same. The latter part of the 11th and 12th are thus rendered by <em>Blayney, </em>— </p><p>A wind that scorcheth the plains in the wilderness, [Shall come] toward the daughter of my people, Not to winnow, nor to cleanse; </p><p><strong>12.</strong>A full wind for a curse shall come at my bidding; Now even I will proceed judicially with them. </p><p><em>Horsley </em>differs as to the 11th verse, and renders it thus, — </p><p>The wind that scorcheth the craggy rocks of the wilderness Taketh its course against the daughter of my people, Not for winnowing or cleansing. </p><p>The reason assigned for rendering <span class="lang he-il">מאלה</span> for “a curse,” and not “from those <em>places</em>, “ as in our version, is, because the enemy did not come from that quarter. But this may be avoided, if we consider “as” or “like” to be understood before wind, which is no uncommon thing in Hebrew. To refer “those” or these to the winds implied in winnowing and cleansing, as <em>Calvin </em>does, and also <em>Gataker </em>and others, is not satisfactory, I would propose the following version, — </p><p>The dry wind of the cliffs in the wilderness Is advancing against the daughter of my people, Not to winnow, nor to cleanse; </p><p><strong>12.</strong><em>As </em>a full wind from these, it shall come for me: Then will I myself pronounce judgments on them. </p><p>The word <span class="lang he-il">דרך</span>, as <em>Horsley </em>takes it, is a verb, or rather a participle; and it is usual in Hebrew to put a participle in the first clause, and in the second a verb, as here, in the future tense. The verb means to come upon, so as to tread down or subdue, <span class="bvs">Jud_5:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Jud_20:43</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_91:13</span>. “The effect of this wind is not only to render the air extremely hot and scorching, but to fill it with poisonous and suffocating vapors.” — <em>Blayney. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
