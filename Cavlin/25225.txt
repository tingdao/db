<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_7:29</span><strong>.</strong><em>And all the people hearing. </em>This part is left out by Matthew, though it throws no small light on the connection of the words; for it was this circumstance which gave rise to Christ’s expostulation, when he perceived that the scribes persisted so obstinately in despising God. The substance of this passage is, that the common <em>people </em>and the <em>publicans </em>gave glory to God; while <em>the Scribes, </em>flattering themselves with confidence in their own knowledge, cared little for what Christ said. At first sight, this tends only to obscure, and even to disfigure, the glory of the Gospel, that Christ could not gather disciples to himself, except from the dregs and offscourings of the people; while he was rejected by those who had any reputation for holiness or learning. But the Lord intended, from the beginning, to hold out this example, that neither the men of that age, nor even posterity, might judge of the Gospel by the approbation of men; for we are all by nature inclined to this vice. And yet nothing is more unreasonable than to submit the truth of God to the judgment of <em>men, </em>whose acuteness and sagacity amounts to nothing more than mere vanity. Accordingly, as Paul says, <em>“God </em>hath chosen that part which is weak and foolish in the eyes of the world, that he may cast down from its height whatever appears to be mighty and wise,” (<span class="bvs">1Co_1:27</span>.) Our duty is to prefer this <em>foolishness of God, </em>to use Paul’s expression, (<span class="bvs">1Co_1:25</span>,) to all the display of human wisdom. </p><p><em>Justified God. </em>This is a very remarkable expression. Those who respectfully embrace the Son of God, and assent to the doctrine which he has brought, are said to ascribe righteousness to God. We need not therefore wonder, if the Holy Spirit everywhere honors faith with remarkable commendations, assigns to it the highest rank in the worship of God, and declares that it is a very acceptable service. For what duty can be deemed more sacred than to vindicate God’s righteousness? The word <em>justify </em>applies generally, no doubt, to every thing connected with the praises of God, and conveys the idea, that God is beheld with approbation, and crowned with glory, by the people who embrace that doctrine of which He is the author. Now, since faith <em>justifies </em>God, it is impossible, on the other hand, but that unbelief must be blasphemy against him, and a disdainful withholding of that praise which is due to his name. This expression also teaches us, that men are never brought into complete subjection to the faith until, disregarding the flesh and sense, they conclude that every thing which comes from God is just and holy, and do not permit themselves to murmur against his word or his works. </p><p><em>Having been baptized with the baptism of John. </em>Luke means that the fruits of <em>the baptism </em>which they had received were then beginning to appear; for it was a useful preparation to them for receiving the doctrine of Christ. It was already an evidence of their piety that they presented themselves to be <em>baptized. </em>Our Lord now leads them forward from that slender instruction to a higher degree of progress, as the scribes, in despising the baptism of John, shut against themselves, through their pride, the gate of faith. If, therefore, we desire to rise to full perfection, let us first guard against despising the very least of God’s invitations, <span class="cite-ref">(25)</span> and be prepared in humility to commence with small and elementary instructions. Secondly, let us endeavor that, if our faith shall have a feeble beginning, it may regularly and gradually increase. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(25)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Gardons premierement de mespriser un seul moyen par lequel Die nous convie</span>;” — “let us first guard against despising a single method by which God invites us.” </p></div></div>
