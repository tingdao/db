He hence concludes, that while the tabernacle under the Law was standing, the sanctuary was closed up, and that only through that being removed could the way be open for us to the kingdom of God. We see that the very form of the ancient tabernacle reminded the Jews that they were to look for something else.

He contends that this had fallen for our great benefit, for through its fall a more familiar access to God has been obtained for us. </p></div>
