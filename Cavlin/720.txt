<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me? </em>Isaac not only expostulates concerning injuries received, but protests that in future he can have no confidence in them, since he had found in them a disposition so hostile to himself. This passage teaches us, that it is lawful for the faithful to complain of their enemies, in order, if possible, to recall them from their purpose of doing injury, and to restrain their force, frauds, and acts of injustice. For liberty is not inconsistent with patience: nor does God require of his own people, that they should silently digest every injury which may be inflicted upon them, but only that they should restrain their minds and hands from revenge. <span class="cite-ref">(41)</span> Now, if their minds are pure and well regulated, their tongues will not be virulent in reproaching the faults of others; but their sole purpose will be to restrain the wicked by a sense of shame from iniquity. For where there is no hope of profiting by complaints, it is better to cherish peace by silence; unless, perhaps, for the purpose of rendering those who delight themselves in wickedness inexcusable. We must, indeed, always beware, lest, from a desire of vengeance, our tongues break out in reproaches; and, as Solomon says, hatred stirreth up strifes. (<span class="bvs">Pro_10:12</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(41)</span>Neque hoc a suis requirit Deus, ut quicquid noxae illatum fuerit, taciti devorent; sed tantum ut animos et manus contineant a vindicta. <span class="lang fr-fr">Dieu ne requiert point des siens, qu’ils avallent sans mot dire toutes les nuisances qu’on leur fera, mais seulement qu’ils gardent leurs coeurs et leur mains de vengence</span>. — <em>Fr</em>. <em>Tr</em>. </p></div></div>
