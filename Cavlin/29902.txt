<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>For there are many unruly. </em><span class="cite-ref">(224)</span> After having laid down a general rule, which ought to be everywhere observed, in order that Titus may be more attentive to adhere to it, he holds out to him the urgent necessity which ought to excite him more than all things else. He warns him that he has to deal with many obstinate and incorrigible persons, that many are puffed up with vanity and idle talk, that many are deceivers; and that therefore they ought to choose, on the other hand, such leaders as are qualified and well prepared to oppose them. For, if the children of this world, when dangers arise, increase their solicitude and watchfulness, it would be disgraceful for us, when Satan is using his utmost efforts to remain careless and inactive, as if we were in a state of peace. </p><p><em>Unruly </em>Instead of (inobedientes) <em>disobedient, </em>which <em>is </em>the rendering in the old translation for<span class="lang el-gr">ἀνυπότακτοι</span> Erasmus translates it (intractabiles) <em>incorrigible. </em>He means those who cannot endure to be brought to obey, and who throw off the yoke of subjection. He gives the appellation of <em>vain talkers</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(225)</span> not only to the authors of false doctrines, but to those who, addicted to ambitious display, occupy themselves with nothing but useless subtleties<span class="lang el-gr">. Ματαιολογία </span><span class="cite-ref">(226)</span> (vain talking) is contrasted with useful and solid doctrine, and therefore includes all trivial and frivolous speculations, which contain nothing but empty bombast, because they contribute nothing to piety and the fear of God. And such is all the scholastic theology that is found, in the present day, in Popery. Yet he calls the same persons <em>deceivers of minds</em>. It may be thought preferable to view this as relating to a different class of persons; but, for my own part, I think that it means the same class; for the teachers of such trifles entice and fascinate the minds of men, so as no longer to receive sound doctrine. </p><p><em>Chiefly they who are of the circumcision. </em>He says that they are chiefly of the Jews; for it is highly requisite that such plagues shall be known by all. We ought not to listen to those who plead that we should spare the reputation of this or that individual, when the matter in question is the great danger of the whole Church. And so much the greater danger was to be apprehended from that nation, because it claimed superiority above others on account of the sacredness of its lineage. This is therefore the reason why Paul reproves the Jews more sharply, in order to take from them the power of doing injury. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(224)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car il y en a plusieurs qui ne se peuvent ranger</span>.” — “For there are many of them who cannot submit.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(225)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Parlans vanitez</span>.” — “Speaking vanities.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(226)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vanite de paroles</span>.” — “Vanity of words.” </p></div></div>
