<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Now, after, </em>etc Here, first, we see the steadfastness of God in watching over his people, and providing for their safety. The sanction given to Joshua’s appointment, as new leader by a renewed commission, <span class="cite-ref">(13)</span> was intended to indicate the continuance of his favor, and prevent the people from thinking themselves forsaken in consequence of the death of Moses. Joshua, indeed, had already been chosen to rule the people; and not only invested with the office, but also endowed with spiritual gifts. But as the most valiant, however well provided, are apt to halt or waver when the period for action arrives, the exhortation to Joshua to make ready forthwith for the expedition was by no means superfluous. Still, however, the call thus formally given was not so much on his own account, as to inspire the people with full confidence in following a leader whom they saw advancing step by step in the path divinely marked out for him. <span class="cite-ref">(14)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(13)</span> “A renewed commission.” Latin, “Repetitis mandatis.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">En reiterant les articles de sa commission</span>;” “By reiterating the articles of his commission.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(14)</span> Or rather, “Who they saw, did not advance a single step till the Lord had preceded him.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
