<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet now sets forth how extremely shameful was the insensibility of the Jews, in not acknowledging that God had most severely and grievously punished the superstitions to which they had previously been addicted. At the same time, if we regard the word used, he seems not to understand punishments by <em>evils, </em>but raffler the wicked deeds by which they had provoked God. And this ought to be observed, for some interpreters give this rendering, “Have you forgotten your evils and those of your fathers;<em>” </em>that is, how severely God had afflicted you? But there is no doubt but that the Prophet means by <span class="lang he-il">רעות</span>, <em>rout, </em>their sins, by which they had exposed themselves to God’s judgment; for it immediately follows, <em>which they did, </em>or committed, <em>in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem </em>But though he means by this word the sins of the people, there is yet no doubt but that he includes also the punishments by which they ought to have known that the impiety in which they continued most obstinately had displeased God. </p><p>When therefore the Prophet says, <em>Have ye forgotten </em>your evils and those of your fathers? he takes it for granted that it was sufficiently known that God had taken vengeance on them for their sins; for he does not address the Jews in their prosperity, but when they were fugitives from their own land and under the curse of heaven. As, then, they were evidently condemned by God, the Prophet justly asks them, “Have ye forgotten that you have been condemned for the sins of your fathers and those of your kings, even for those which they had committed?” This he asked, because it was a horrid stupidity, that though the <em>city </em>had been overthrown and the temple burnt, they did not yet leave off their superstitions, especially when so singular a vengeance of God ought to have retained their posterity in fear and obedience even for ten ages. Thus we see that punishment is linked with sins. </p><p>He says, <em>of the kings of Judah and of their wives </em>The relative is singular, “his wives;<em>” </em>but no doubt it refers to the people. Some read, “of every one of them;<em>” </em>but there is no need, it being a singular number, referring to a collective noun, Judah. he afterwards adds, <em>which they did </em>This ought not to be confined to the women, (nor is it suitable,) but it refers to all the Jews as well as to kings of Judah, and also to the women, — <em>which </em>then <em>they did in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem </em></p><p>When he mentions <em>the streets of Jerusalem, </em>he exaggerates their wickedness. For we know that city to have been as it were the earthly sanctuary of God. It, was then a most disgraceful impiety to pollute that place which God had consecrated for himself. The whole land of Judah was indeed under his authority and power, but he had favored the city, and especially Mount Sion, with singular privileges. Then the Prophet amplifies the greatness of their sin, when he says that Jerusalem had been polluted by their superstitions. </p></div>
