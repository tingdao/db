It is uncertain for what cause he stayed at Charran; yet it may be that the weakness of his father caused him to tarry there, who, as we read, died there shortly after; or else, because he durst go no further, until such time as the Lord had told him whither he should go. It is more like to be true in mine opinion, that he was stayed there a while with the wearisomeness and sickness of his father, because Stephen saith plainly that he was brought thence after the death of his father. </p><p><strong>(376)</strong> “Non procrastinat, sed moras omnes rampit,” he does not procrastinate, but breaks off all delay. </p></div>
