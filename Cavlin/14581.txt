<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Nevertheless thou hast abhorred us </em>Here follows a complaint, in which they bewail their present miseries and extreme calamity. There is here described such a change as showed not only that God had ceased to exercise towards them his accustomed favor, but also, that he was openly adverse and hostile to his people. First, they complain that they have been rejected as through hatred, for such is the proper import of the word <span class="lang he-il">זנחת</span>,<em>zanachta, </em>which, along with others, I have translated <em>abhorred </em>If, however, any would rather translate it <em>to forget, </em>or <em>to be cast off</em>, I have no great objection to it. They next add, that they had been <em>put to shame, </em>namely, because it must necessarily follow that every thing should go ill with them when deprived of the protection of God. This they declare immediately after, when they say, that God <em>no longer goes forth with their armies </em>— goes forth as their leader or standard-bearer when they go forth to war. </p></div>
