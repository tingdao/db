<div class="comment-content"><p>He pursues the same subject, but in other words. He first says, that God <em>had without pardon destroyed all the habitations of Jacob</em>; some read, “all the beauty (or the ornament) of Jacob.” But the other rendering is more suitable, that he had destroyed all the <em>habitations </em>of Jacob; and then that he had <em>demolished in his indignation</em>, etc. The word is derived from what means excess; but we know that all words signifying wrath are transferred to God, but they do not properly belong to him. God, then, <em>in his violent wrath had demolished all fortresses</em>, and <em>cast them to the ground</em>; and afterwards, that he had <em>profaned</em>, etc. </p><p>This profanation of the kingdom, and of the princes, corresponds with the former verse, where he said that God had not remembered his footstool for we know that the kingdom was sacerdotal and consecrated to God. When, therefore, it was polluted, it follows that God in a manner exposed his name to reproach, because the mouth of all the ungodly was thus opened, so that they insolently poured forth their slanders. That God, then, spared not the kingdom nor the Temple, it hence followed that his wrath against the Jews was dreadful. Now, as he is a righteous judge, it follows, that such was the greatness of the sins of the Jews, that they sustained the blame for this extreme sacrilege; for it was through their sins that God’s name was exposed to reproach both as to the Temple and the kingdom. </p></div>
