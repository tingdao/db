<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>The work of God is this. </em>They had spoken of <em>works </em>Christ reminds them of one work, that is, <em>faith</em>; by which he means that all that men undertake without<em>faith </em>is vain and useless, but that<em>faith </em>alone is sufficient, because <em>this </em>alone does God require from us, <em>that we believe </em>For there is here an implied contrast between <em>faith </em>and the <em>works </em>and efforts of men; as if he had said, Men toil to no purpose, when they endeavor to please God without <em>faith</em>, because, by running, as it were, out of the course, they do not advance towards the goal. This is a remarkable passage, showing that, though men torment themselves wretchedly throughout their whole life, still they lose their pains, if they have not<em>faith </em>in Christ as the rule of their life. Those who infer from this passage that <em>faith </em>is the gift of God are mistaken; for Christ does not now show what God produces in us, but what he wishes and requires from us. </p><p>But we may think it strange that God approves of nothing but <em>faith </em>alone; for the love of our neighbor ought not to be despised, and the other exercises of religion do not lose their place and honor. So then, though <em>faith </em>may hold the highest rank, still other works are not superfluous. The reply is easy; for <em>faith </em>does not exclude either the love of our neighbor or any other good work, because it contains them all within itself. <em>Faith </em>is called <em>the only work of God</em>, because by means of it we possess Christ, and thus become the sons of God, so that he governs us by his Spirit. So then, because Christ does not separate <em>faith </em>from its fruits, we need not wonder if he make it to be the first and the last. <span class="cite-ref">(140)</span></p><p><em>That you believe in him whom he hath sent. </em>What is the import of the word <em>believe</em>, we have explained under the Third Chapter. It ought always to be remembered that, in order to have a full perception of the power of <em>faith</em>, we must understand what Christ is, in whom we <em>believe</em>, and why he was given to us by the Father. It is idle sophistry, under the pretext of this passage, to maintain that we are justified by works, if faith justifies, because it is likewise called <em>a work </em>First, it is plain enough that Christ does not speak with strict accuracy, when he calls faith <em>a work</em>, just as Paul makes a comparison between <em>the law of faith </em>and <em>the law of works</em>, (<span class="bvs">Rom_3:27</span>.) Secondly, when we affirm that men are not justified by <em>works</em>, we mean <em>works </em>by the merit of which men may obtain favor with God. Now <em>faith </em>brings nothing to God, but, on the contrary, places man before God as empty and poor, that he may be filled with Christ and with his grace. It is, therefore, if we may be allowed the expression, a passive work, to which no reward can be paid, and it bestows on man no other righteousness than that which he receives from Christ. </p><p><strong>(140)</strong> “Proram et puppim,” literally, “stem and stern,” a Latin idiom for <em>the whole</em>. The Author’s French version (ed. 1558) renders the clause, “<span class="lang fr-fr">il ne se faut point esbahir s’il constitue en elle la fin et le commencement</span>;” — “we must not be astonished if he makes it to be the end and the beginning;” and in ed. 1564, it runs thus, “<span class="lang fr-fr">ce n’est pas merveille que la foy est tout ce que Dieu requiert</span>;” — “it is not wonderful that faith is all that God requires.” </p></div>
