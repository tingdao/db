<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_28:16</span><strong>.</strong><em>And the eleven disciples went into Galilee. </em>Matthew, passing by those occurrences which we have taken out of the other three Evangelists, mentions only in what place <em>the eleven disciples </em>were appointed to the apostolic office. For—as we have already had frequent opportunities of perceiving—it was not the intention of the Evangelists to embrace every part of the history; because the Holy Spirit, who guided their pen, has thought fit to compose such a summary as we see out of their united testimonies. Matthew has therefore selected what was of the greatest importance to us, namely, that when Christ appeared to the disciples, he likewise commissioned them to be apostles, to convey into every part of the world the message of eternal life. </p><p><em>To the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. </em>Though <em>the mountain </em>is not mentioned any where else, yet we con-elude that this spot <em>in Galilee </em>was known to Mary. <span class="cite-ref">(323)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(323)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Christ enseigna nommément ce lieu-là a Marie</span>;” — “that Christ expressly informed Mary respecting that place.” </p></div></div>
