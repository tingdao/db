They say that Jesus ought not to be regarded as the Christ, because he said that he would die, while <em>the Law </em>ascribes perpetuity to the Messiah; as if both statements had not been expressly made in <em>the Law </em>that Christ will die, and that afterwards his kingdom will flourish to the end of the world. But they seize on the second clause, and make it a ground of calumny. The origin of their error was, that they judged of the splendor of Messiah’s kingdom according to their carnal views; in consequence of which, they reject Christ because he does not correspond to their foolish notion. Under the term <em>the Law </em>they embrace also the Prophets, and the present tense — <em>remaineth </em>— -is used, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, instead of the future tense, <em>will remain </em></p><p><em>Who is that Son of man? </em>This is a reproachful question, as if that short refutation vanquished Christ so completely that he had nothing more to say. <span class="cite-ref">(27)</span> This shows how haughty their ignorance was; for it is as if they had said, “Go now, and boast that thou art the Christ, since thine own confession proves that thou hast nothing to do with the Messiah.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(27)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme si Christ demeuroit confus, sans avoir plus que dire</span>.” </p></div></div>
