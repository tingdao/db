<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>47.</strong><em>And I will delight myself </em>The sentiment contained in this verse is similar to that which he had previously mentioned. The amount is, he held the commandments of God in such high esteem, that he experienced nothing more pleasant to him than the making of them his constant theme of meditation. By the term <em>delight, </em>he expresses the intensity of his love. The phrase <em>I will lift up my hands, </em>refers, to the same thing. It is a sure indication that we eagerly desire a thing when we stretch out the hands to grasp and enjoy it. This simile, therefor denotes the ardor of his desire. <span class="cite-ref">(416)</span> If a man, by his mien and gait pretend any such affection for the law of God, and yet pay no regard to it in the affairs of life, he would be justly chargeable with the basest hypocrisy. Again, he affirms, that that affection, so earnest and so ardent, springs from the sweetness of the law of God having knit our hearts to it. Finally, he says, he <em>would meditate on God’s testimonies. </em>Along with the majority of commentators, I have no doubt that the word <span class="lang he-il">שוח</span><em>shuach, </em>denotes that silent and secret musing in which the children of God exercise themselves. </p><p><strong>(416)</strong> “<em>The lifting up of the hands </em>is used in Scripture to denote, first, <em>praying</em>, (<span class="bvs">Psa_28:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Lam_2:19</span>; <span class="bvs">1Ti_2:8</span>;) secondly, <em>blessing</em>, (<span class="bvs">Lev_19:22</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_22:4</span>;) thirdly, <em>swearing</em>, (<span class="bvs">Gen_14:22</span>; <span class="bvs">Deu_32:40</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_106:26</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_36:7</span>; <span class="bvs">Rev_10:5</span>;) fourthly, <em>setting about any undertaking</em>, (<span class="bvs">Gen_41:44</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_10:13</span>; <span class="bvs">Heb_12:12</span>) Aben Ezra, however, explains, (and perhaps rightly,) that the metaphor, in this place, is taken from the action of those who receive any one whom they were glad or proud to see with uplifted hands.” — <em>Cresswell</em>. Merrick explains the phrase thus: “I will reach out my hands with eagerness, in order to receive thy commandments.” </p></div>
