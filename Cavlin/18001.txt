It is as if he had said that the most distant nations will be witnesses of this destruction, because not only will the <em>ensign </em>be beheld by all, but the sound of the trumpets will be heard throughout the whole world. This will plainly shew that the war did not originate with men, but with God himself, who will prove himself to be the author of it by remarkable tokens. When wars are carried on, every one sees clearly what is done; but the greater part of men ascribe the beginning and end of them to chance. On the other hand, Isaiah shews that all these things ought to be ascribed to God, because he will display his power in a new and extraordinary manner; for sometimes he works so as to conceal his hand and to prevent his work from being perceived by men, but sometimes he displays his hand in such a manner that all are constrained to acknowledge it; and that is what the Prophet meant. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(17)</span> Bogus footnote </p><p><span class="cite-note">(18)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
