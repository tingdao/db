<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Let confusion of which he is not aware come upon him. </em>David again prays that God would cause to return upon the head of his enemies the mischief which they had directed against a just and an inoffensive man. The change from the plural to the singular number, even when the same subject, is spoken of, is, we know, a thing very common among the Hebrews. Accordingly, what is here said of one man is applicable to all David’s enemies in general, unless, perhaps, we are rather inclined to suppose that allusion is here made to Saul or some one of his nobles. But as it is certain that the prayer which he here offers against Saul as the head extends to the whole body, in other words, to all his followers, <span class="cite-ref">(707)</span> it matters little in which way we understand it. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שואה</span>, <em>shoah, </em>sometimes signifies <em>confusion, </em>and sometimes <em>destruction; </em>and, therefore, many translate it, <em>Let destruction, </em>or <em>desolation, </em>or <em>ruin, come upon him. </em>The other rendering, however, seems more suitable, for he immediately adds, <em>Let his own net which he hath hidden catch him, let him fall into it with confusion </em>The way in which others render it, <em>Let him fall into destruction itself, </em>is certainly forced and unnatural. But the meaning of the clause will be brought out very suitable if it is viewed as a prayer of David, that as the wicked settle down like wine upon the lees, in present enjoyments, and fear nothing, as if they were placed beyond the reach of all danger, some calamity which they think not of may suddenly come upon them like a tempest, and overwhelm them. It never for a moment occurs to them as at all possible that their stratagems and craft, their wicked practices, and all the snares which they lay for the good and the simple, turn to the destruction of themselves who have devised them. David, therefore, very properly desires that they may fall with confusion into the nets which they have laid; in other words, that they may be filled with amazement and terror when they are suddenly and unexpectedly visited with calamity. The more unbounded and extravagant the exultation of men is, through their vainly and foolishly imagining that they shall escape unpunished, the more are they filled with amazement and fear when calamity suddenly overtakes them. I have, however, no doubt that David here refers to some strange and extraordinary calamity. Let <em>confusion, </em>then, of which he thinks not, come upon him; that is to say, when he shall have persuaded himself that all goes well with him, and promised himself peace in his deceitful fascinations, then let unwonted terror strike him to the heart, and let him feel by his tumultuous fear that he is caught in his own snares. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(707)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il fait yci contre Saul comme le chef, s’estend a tout le corps, c’est a dire, tous ses adherens</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
