<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>47.</strong><em>He who believeth in me. </em>This is an explanation of the former statement. For we are taught by these words that it is when we believe in Christ that God is made known to us; for then do we begin to see, as in a mirror, or as in a bright and lively image, God who was formerly invisible. Accursed then be every thing that is declared to us concerning God, if it do not lead us to Christ. What it is to believe in Christ I have already explained; for we must not imagine a confused and empty faith, which deprives Christ of his power, as the Papists do, who believe in Christ just as far as they think fit. For the reason why we obtain life by faith is, that we know that all the parts of our life are contained in Christ. </p><p>The inference which some draw from this passage — that <em>to believe in Christ </em>is the same thing as <em>to eat Christ</em>, or <em>his flesh </em>— is not well founded. For these two things differ from each other as former and latter; and in like manner, to <em>come to Christ </em>and to <em>drink </em>him, for <em>coming to him </em>is first in order. I acknowledge that Christ is not eaten but by faith; but the reason is, because we receive him by faith, that he may dwell in us, and that we may be made partakers of him, and thus may be one with him. To <em>eat </em>him, therefore, is an effect or work of faith. </p></div>
