<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>The ungodly walk about on every side. </em>The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">סביב</span>,<em>sabib, </em>which we have translated <em>on every side, </em>signifies <em>a circuit, </em>or <em>a going round; </em>and, therefore, some explain it allegorically thus: the ungodly seize upon all the defiles or narrow parts of roads, in order to shut up or besiege the good on all sides; and others expound it even more ingeniously, thus: that they lay snares by indirect means, and by inventions full of art and deception. But I think the simple meaning is, that they possess the whole land, and range about through every part of it; as if the Psalmist had said, Wherever I turn my eyes, I see troops of them on every side. In the next clause he complains that mankind are shamefully and basely oppressed by their tyranny. This is the meaning, provided the clause is read as a distinct one by itself, separate from the preceding, a point about which interpreters differ, although this view seems to come nearer to the mind of the inspired writer. Some render the verse in one continuous sentence, thus: <em>The ungodly fly about every where, when the reproaches among the children of men </em>(that is to say, when the worthless and the refuse of men) <em>are exalted, </em>an exposition which is not unsuitable. It commonly happens, that as diseases flow from the head into the members, so corruptions proceed from princes, and infect the whole people. As, however, the former exposition is more generally received, and the most learned grammarians tell us that the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">זלות</span>, <em>zuluth, </em>which we have translated <em>reproach, </em>is a noun of the singular number, I have adopted the former exposition, not that I am dissatisfied with the latter, but because we must needs choose the one or the other. </p></div>
