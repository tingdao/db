<div class="comment-content"><p>Now at length the Prophet openly attacks those by whom he was consulted. After showing that they sprang from impure fathers — which was sufficiently manifest from their never ceasing to provoke God in every age from the very beginning to the end — he turns their own language against them, and asks, <em>whether they were polluted after the superstitions of their fathers? </em>The old interpretation is “truly;” but <span class="lang he-il">ה</span>, <em>he</em>, the mark of interrogation, does not allow of that. I am surprised at the rendering of some expositors, are you not polluted?” as if the word were <span class="lang he-il">הלוא</span>, <em>hel-va</em>, for in my opinion they pervert the Prophet’s sense, for this would make him ask absurdly, <em>what? are you polluted in the way of your fathers? and are you gone astray after their idols? </em>For when they were in exile, that disinheriting ought to subdue them although they had been endued with a more than iron pride: and then they pretended to piety, when they came to the Prophet and desired to receive some consolation from him.
