<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>I indeed judge</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(258)</span><em>etc. </em>Though they take not altogether an unsuitable view who understand this as a kind of modification; yet I prefer to regard it in the light of an encouragement, for the purpose of anticipating an objection, according to this import, — “It ought not indeed to be grievous to us, if we must pass through various afflictions into celestial glory, since these, when compared with the greatness of that glory, are of the least moment.” He has mentioned <em>future </em>for eternal glory, intimating that the afflictions of the world are such as pass away quickly. </p><p>It is hence evident how ill understood has this passage been by the Schoolmen; for they have drawn from it their frivolous distinction between congruity and condignity. The Apostle indeed compares not the worthiness of the one with that of the other, but only lightens the heaviness of the cross by a comparison with the greatness of glory, in order to confirm the minds of the faithful in patience. </p><p><strong>(258)</strong> The particle<span class="lang el-gr">γὰρ </span> cannot be causal here. It has its primary meaning <em>truly</em>, <em>indeed</em>, or <em>verily</em>, though it has commonly its secondary meaning <em>for</em>, <em>because</em>, <em>therefore. </em>The context is our guide; when there is nothing previously said, for which a reason is given, then it has only an affirmative sense: or as some think, it is to be viewed as a particle of transition, or as signifying an addition, and may be rendered <em>besides</em>, <em>further</em>, <em>moreover</em>, perhaps this latter meaning would be suitable here. In the preceded verse the Apostle says, for the encouragement of Christians, that their conformity to Christ in suffering would terminate in conformity to him in glory: and then, as an additional consideration, he states his full conviction, that present sufferings are as nothing to the glory which they would have to enjoy. The connection can hardly be otherwise seen, except indeed we consider something understood, as, “Not only so;” and then it may be rendered<em>for</em>, as giving a reason for the qualifying negative. An ellipsis of this kind is not without examples in Greek authors, as well as in the New Testament. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
