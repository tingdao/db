<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>When affliction or persecution ariseth on account of the word. </em>By way of example, Christ says that such persons are made uneasy by the offense of the cross. And certainly, as the heat of the sun discovers the barrenness of the soil, so <em>persecution </em>and the cross lay open the vanity of those, who are slightly influenced by I know not what desire, but are not actually moved by earnest feelings of piety. Such persons, according to Matthew and Mark, are <em>temporary, </em><span class="cite-ref">(204)</span> not only because, having professed, for a time, that they are the disciples of Christ, they afterwards fall away through temptation, but because they imagine that they have true faith. According to Luke, Christ says that they <em>believe for a time; </em>because that honor which they render to the Gospel resembles faith. <span class="cite-ref">(205)</span> At the same time we ought to learn, that they are not truly regenerated by the incorruptible seed, <em>which never fadeth, </em>as Peter tells us, (<span class="bvs">1Pe_1:4</span>;) for he says that these words of Isaiah, <em>The word of God endureth for ever, </em>(<span class="bvs">Isa_40:8</span>; <span class="bvs">1Pe_1:25</span>,) are fulfilled in the hearts of believers, in whom the truth of God, once fixed, never passes away, but retains its vigor to the end. Still, those persons who take delight in the word of God, and cherish some reverence for it, do in some manner <em>believe; </em>for they are widely different from unbelievers, who give no credit to God when he speaks, or who reject his word. In a word, let us learn that none are partakers of true faith, except those who are scaled with the Spirit of adoption, and who sincerely call on God as their Father; and as that Spirit is never extinguished, so it is impossible that the faith, which he has once engraven on the hearts of the godly, shall pass away or be destroyed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(204)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Temporels, c’est a dire, de petite duree</span>;” — “temporary, that is to say, of short duration.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(205)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ressemble aucunement a la foy</span>;” — “somewhat resembles faith.” </p></div></div>
