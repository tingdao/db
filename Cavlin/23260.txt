<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Be agreed with thy adversary </em>Christ appears to go farther, and to exhort to reconciliation not only those who have injured their brethren, but those also who are unjustly treated. <span class="cite-ref">(401)</span> But I interpret the words as having been spoken with another view, to take away occasion for hatred and resentment, and to point out the method of cherishing good-will. For whence come all injuries, but from this, that each person is too tenacious of his own rights, that is, each is too much disposed to consult his own convenience to the disadvantage of others? Almost all are so blinded by a wicked love of themselves, that, even in the worst causes, they flatter themselves that they are in the right. To meet all hatred, enmity, debates, and acts of injustice, Christ reproves that obstinacy, which is the source of these evils, and enjoins his own people to cultivate moderation and justice, and to make some abatement from the highest rigor, that, by such an act of justice, they may purchase for themselves peace and friendship. <span class="cite-ref">(402)</span> It were to be wished, indeed, that no controversy of any kind should ever arise among us; and undoubtedly men would never break out into abuse or quarrelling, if they possessed a due share of meekness. But, as it is scarcely possible but that differences will sometimes happen, Christ points out the remedy, by which they may be immediately settled; and that is, to put a restraint on our desires, and rather to act to our own disadvantage, than follow up our rights with unflinching rigor. That Christ frequently gave this exhortation is evident from the twelfth chapter of Luke’s Gospel, where he does not relate the sermon on the mount, but gives an abridgment of various passages in our Lord’s discourses. </p><p><em>Lest the adversary deliver thee to the judge </em>This part is explained by some in a metaphorical sense, that the Heavenly Judge will act toward us with the utmost rigor, so as to forgive us nothing, if we do not labor to settle those differences which we have with our neighbors. But I view it more simply, as an admonition that, even among men, it is usually advantageous for us to come to an early agreement with adversaries, because, with quarrelsome persons, their obstinacy often costs them dear. At the same time, I admit, that the comparison is justly applied to God; for he will <em>exercise judgment without mercy </em>(<span class="bvs">Jas_2:13</span>) to him who is implacable to his brethren, or pursues his contentiousness to the utmost. But it is highly ridiculous in the Papists, to construct their purgatory out of a continued allegory on this passage. Nothing is more evident than that the subject of Christ’s discourse is the cultivation of friendship among men. They have no shame, or conscientious scruple, to pervert his words, and to torture them into a widely different meaning, provided they can impose on the unlearned. But as they do not deserve a lengthened refutation, I shall only point out, in a single word, their shameful ignorance. <em>The adversary </em>is supposed by them to be the devil. But Christ enjoins those who believe on him to <em>be agreed with the adversary </em>Therefore, in order that the Papists may find their purgatory here, they must first become the friends and brethren of devils. A <em>farthing </em>is well known to be the fourth part of a penny: but here, as is evident from Luke, it denotes a <em>mite, </em>or any small piece of money. Now, if we were disposed to cavilling, <span class="cite-ref">(403)</span> we might here obtain another exposure of the absurdity of the Papists. For, if he who has once entered Purgatory will never leave it, <em>till he has paid the last farthing, </em>it follows, that the suffrages (as they call them) of the living for the dead are of no avail. For Christ makes no allowance, that others may free a debtor by satisfying for him, but expressly demands from each person the payment of what he owes. <span class="cite-ref">(404)</span> Now, if Moses and other satisfactions are useless, however warm the fire of Purgatory may be, yet the kitchens of priests and monks, for the sake of which they are so anxious to maintain it, will be cool enough. </p><p><strong>(401)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais aussi ceux qui sont assaillis et provoquez les premiers</span>;” — “but also those who are first attacked and provoked.” </p><p><strong>(402)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin que ne prenans pas les choses a la rigueur, ils rachetent paix et amite en se monstrans ainsi traitables</span>.” — “That, not taking things to the rigor, they may purchase peace and friendship, by showing themselves so tractable.” </p><p><strong>(403)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui voudroit user de cavillation et chippoter sur chacun mot</span>.” — “One who would cavil and higgle about every word.” </p><p><strong>(404)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais il requiert nommement qu'un chacun satisface pour soy, et paye ce qu'il doit</span>.” — “But he requires expressly that each satisfy for himself and pay what he owes.” </p></div>
