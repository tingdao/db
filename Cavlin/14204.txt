<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>For thou wilt set them as a butt. </em>As the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שכם</span>,<em>shekem, </em>which we have rendered <em>a butt, </em>properly signifies <em>a shoulder, </em>some understand it in that sense here, and explain the sentence thus: Their heads shall be smitten with heavy blows, so that having their bodies bended, their shoulders shall appear sticking out. According to these interpreters, the subjugation of the enemies of God is here metaphorically pointed out. But there is another explanation which is more generally received even among the Jewish expositors, namely, that God will shut them up in some corner, and there keep them from doing mischief; <span class="cite-ref">(492)</span> and they take this view, because the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שכם</span>, <em>shekem, </em>is often used to denote a <em>corner, quarter, </em>or <em>place. </em>As, however, the sacred writer, in the clause immediately following, represents God as furnished with a bow, ready to shoot his arrows directly in their faces, I have no doubt that, continuing his metaphor, he compares them to a butt, or mound of earth, on which it is customary to plant the mark which is aimed at, and thus the sense will flow very naturally thus: Lord, thou wilt make them as it were a butt against which to shoot thine arrows. <span class="cite-ref">(493)</span> The great object which the Psalmist has in view is doubtless to teach us to exercise patience, until God, at the fit time, bring the ungodly to their end. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(492)</span><em>Kimchi </em>and others read, “Thou wilt put them into a corner;” which has been understood in this sense, “Thou wilt thrust them into a corner, and then direct thine arrows against their faces.” — See <em>Poole’s Synopsis Criticorum. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(493)</span> This is the view taken by <em>Ainsworth, Castellio, Cocceius, Diodati, Dathe, Horsley, </em>and<em>Fry. Horsley </em>translates the verse thus:— </p><p>“Truly thou shalt make them a butt for thine arrows; <LineBreak />Thou shalt take a steady aim against them.” </p><p>“I take,” says he, “<span class="lang he-il">כונך</span>, [the word which he translates <em>a steady aim, </em>] to be a technical term of archery, to express the act of taking aim at a particular object.” In our English version it is, Therefore thou shalt make them turn their backs.” In defense of this sense of <span class="lang he-il">שכם</span>, <em>shekem, </em>see <em>Merrick’s Annotations. </em>Gesenius takes the word in the same sense. Literally, “thy bow-string.” </p></div></div>
