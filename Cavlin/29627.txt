<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>Therefore let us not sleep</em>. He adds other metaphors closely allied to the preceding one. For as he lately shewed that it were by no means seemly that they should be blind in the midst of light, so he now admonishes that it were dishonorable and disgraceful to sleep or be drunk in the middle of the day. Now, as he gives the name of <em>day </em>to the doctrine of the gospel, by which the Christ, the <em>Sun of righteousness </em>(<span class="bvs">Mal_4:2</span>) is manifested to us, so when he speaks of sleep and drunkenness, he does not mean natural sleep, or drunkenness from wine, but stupor of mind, when, forgetting God and ourselves, we regardlessly indulge our vices. <em>Let us not sleep</em>, says he; that is, let us not, sunk in indolence, become senseless in the world. <em>As others</em>, that is, unbelievers, <span class="cite-ref">(595)</span> from whom ignorance of God, like a dark night, takes away understanding and reason. <em>But let us watch</em>, that is, let us look to the Lord with an attentive mind. <em>And be sober</em>, that is, casting away the cares of the world, which weigh us down by their pressure, and throwing off base lusts, mount to heaven with freedom and alacrity. For this is spiritual sobriety, when we use this world so sparingly and temperately that we are not entangled with its allurements. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(595)</span> “The <em>refuse</em>, as the word <span class="lang el-gr">λοιποὶ</span> emphatically signifies, or the reprobate and worst of men....
