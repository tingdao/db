<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>So that ye come behind in no gift </em><span class="lang el-gr">̔Υστερεισθαι</span> means to be in want of what you would otherwise stand in need of. <span class="cite-ref">(49)</span> He means, therefore, that the Corinthians abound in all the gifts of God, so as not to be in want of anything, as if he had said, “The Lord has not merely honored you with the light of the gospel, but has eminently endowed you with all those graces that may be of service to the saints for helping them forward in the way of salvation.” For he gives the name of gifts (<span class="lang el-gr">χαρίσματα</span>) to those spiritual graces that are, as it were, means of salvation to the saints. But it is objected, on the other hand, that the saints are never in such abundance as not to feel in want of graces to some extent, so that they must always of necessity be “<em>hungering and thirsting </em>” (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:6</span>.) For where is the man that does not come far short of perfection? I answer, “As they are sufficiently endowed with needful gifts, and are never in such destitution but that the Lord seasonably relieves their need; Paul on this ground ascribes to them such wealth.” For the same reason he adds: <em>waiting for the manifestation</em>, meaning, that he does not ascribe to them such abundance as to leave nothing to be desired; but merely as much as will suffice, until they shall have arrived at perfection. The participle <em>waiting </em>I understand in this sense, “In the meantime while you are waiting.” Thus the meaning will be, “So that ye are in want of no gift in the meantime while you are waiting for the day of perfected revelation, by which Christ our wisdom (<span class="bvs">1Co_1:30</span>) will be fully manifested.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(49)</span> The word is used in this sense in the following passages: <span class="bvs">Luk_15:14</span>; <span class="bvs">2Co_11:9</span>; <span class="bvs">Phi_4:12</span>; and <span class="bvs">Heb_11:37</span>. The proper meaning is — to come too late for a thing, and so miss of it. Xenophon uses it in this sense. <span class="lang el-gr">Αβροκόμας ὑστερησε τὢς μάχης</span> : — “Abrocomas came too late for the battle.” The word occurs in the same sense in Hebews 4:1 and Hebews 12:15. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
