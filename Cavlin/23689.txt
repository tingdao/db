<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Thou art the Christ. </em>The confession is short, but it embraces all that is contained in our salvation; for the designation <em>Christ</em>, or <em>Anointed</em>, includes both an everlasting Kingdom and an everlasting Priesthood, to reconcile us to God, and, by expiating our sins through his sacrifice, to obtain for us a perfect righteousness, and, having received us under his protection, to uphold and supply and enrich us with every description of blessings. Mark says only, <em>Thou art the Christ. </em>Luke says, <em>Thou art the Christ of God </em>But the meaning is the same; for the <em>Christs </em>( <span class="lang el-gr">χριστοί</span>) <em>of God </em>was the appellation anciently bestowed on kings, who had been anointed by the divine command. <span class="cite-ref">(438)</span> And this phrase had been previously employed by Luke, ( <span class="bvs">Luk_2:26</span>,) when he said that Simeon had been informed by a revelation from heaven that <em>he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ </em>For the redemption, which God manifested by the hand of his Son, was clearly divine; and therefore it was necessary that he who was to be the Redeemer should come from heaven, bearing the impress of the <em>anointing </em>of God. Matthew expresses it still more clearly, <em>Thou art the Son of the living God; </em>for, though Peter did not yet understand distinctly in what way Christ was the begotten of God, he was so fully persuaded of the dignity of Christ, that he believed him to come from God, not like other men, but by the inhabitation of the true and living Godhead in his flesh. When the attribute <em>living </em>is ascribed to God, it is for the purpose of distinguishing between Him and dead idols, who <em>are nothing</em>, ( <span class="bvs">1Co_8:4</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(438)</span> See Harmony, vol. 1, p. 92, n. 2; p. 142, n. 2. </p></div></div>
