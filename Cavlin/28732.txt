<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Then is our preaching vain </em>— not simply as having some mixture of falsehood, but as being altogether an empty fallacy. For what remains if Christ has been swallowed up by death — if he has become extinct — if he has been overwhelmed by the curse of sin — if, in fine, he has been overcome by Satan? In short, if that fundamental article is subverted, all that remains will be of no moment. For the same reason he adds, that their <em>faith will be vain, </em>for what solidity of faith will there be, where no hope of life is to be seen? But in the death of Christ, considered in itself, <span class="cite-ref">(35)</span> there is seen nothing but ground of despair, for he cannot be the author of salvation to others, who has been altogether vanquished by death. Let us therefore bear in mind, that the entire gospel consists mainly in the death and resurrection of Christ, so that we must direct our chief attention to this, if we would desire, in a right and orderly manner, to make progress in the gospel — nay more, if we would not remain <em>barren and unfruitful. </em>(<span class="bvs">2Pe_1:8</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(35)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, sans la </span><em class="lang fr-fr">resurrection </em>;” — “That is to say, apart from his resurrection.” </p></div></div>
