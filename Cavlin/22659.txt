<div class="comment-content"><p>Interpreters differ as to the word <span class="lang he-il">האש</span>, <em>eash</em>: some think that it ought to be read <span class="lang he-il">האיש</span>, <em>eaish, </em>with an addition of two letters, and render it, “Is it yet man?” But this would render the passage abrupt. Others translate, “Is there yet fire?” As though it was <span class="lang he-il">אש</span>, <em>ash</em>; and they suppose that wealth, wickedly and unjustly got, is so called, because it consumes itself. But as this is against what grammar requires, I am more inclined to take their view, who think that <span class="lang he-il">האש</span>, <em>eash, </em>is to be taken here for <span class="lang he-il">היש</span>, <em>eish, </em><span class="cite-ref">(172)</span><em>, aleph </em>being put for jod: and they rightly consider that the sentence is to be read as a question, <em>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the ungodly? </em>If this view be approved, then we must consider the Prophet as proposing a question respecting a thing really monstrous, — How can it be that treasures, gathered by plunder and wickedness, still remain with you, since ye have been so often warned, and since God daily urges you to repentance? How great is your hardness, that no fear of God lays hold on your minds? But the meaning would not be unsuitable were we to regard God as a Judge examining them concerning a matter unknown, Are there still the treasures of impiety in the house of the ungodly? that is, “I will see whether the ungodly and wicked hide their treasures:” for God often assumes the character of earthly judges; not that any thing escapes his knowledge, but that we may know that he is not precipitant in deciding a question. This view, then, is by no means inappropriate, that is, that God here assumes the character of an earthly judge, and thus speaks, “I will see whether there are still treasures concealed by the ungodly; I will search their houses; I will know whether they have as yet repented of their crimes.” thus, then, may be understood the words of the Prophet, <em>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the ungodly? </em>For God, as I have already said, shows that he would know respecting the plunders and the various kinds of cruelty which they had exercised. </p><p>He then adds, Is there <em>the bare measure, </em>that is, a measure less than it ought to be, <em>which is detestable? </em><span class="cite-ref">(173)</span> Then he says, </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(172)</span> One MS. Has <span class="lang he-il">היש</span>, which no doubt is the true reading. The Septuagint has <span class="lang el-gr">μηπυρ</span>, which seems to have no sense whatever. Many copies have <span class="lang he-il">האיש</span>, and this is the reading followed by <em>Junius </em>and <em>Tremelius, </em>and their version is this, — </p><p><em>Has any one still the house of a dishonest </em>man? <em><LineBreak /></em><em>The treasures of dishonesty? </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And the small detestable ephah? </em></p><p>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(173)</span> Literally it is, “And the ephah of detestable scantiness?” <em>Marckius </em>renders the words, “Et ephah tenuitatis abominabilis ?” <em>Henderson, </em>“And the accursed <em>scanty ephah? </em>” </p></div></div>
