<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Not as Moses </em>Paul is not reasoning as to the intention of Moses. For as it was his office, to publish the law to his people, so, there can be no doubt that he was desirous, that its true meaning should be apprehended by all, and that he did not intentionally involve his doctrine in obscurity, but that the fault was on the part of the people. As, therefore, he could not renew the minds of the hearers, he was contented with faithfully discharging the duty assigned to him. Nay more, the Lord having commanded him to put a <em>veil </em>between his face and the eyes of the beholders, he obeyed. Nothing, therefore, is said here to the dishonor of Moses, for he was not required to do more than the commission, that was assigned to him, called for. In addition to this, that bluntness, or that weak and obtuse vision, of which Paul is now speaking, is confined to unbelievers exclusively, because the law though wrapt up in figures, <span class="cite-ref">(405)</span> did nevertheless <em>impart wisdom to babes, </em><span class="bvs">Psa_19:7</span><span class="cite-ref">(406)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(405)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Figures et ombres</span>;” — “Figures and shadows.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(406)</span> “The clause rendered in our authorized version — making wise the simple, is rendered by Calvin, instructing the babe in wisdom.
