<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And God met Balaam. </em>It is wonderful that God should have determined to have anything in common with the pollutions of Balaam; since there is no communion between light and darkness, and He detests all association with demons; but, however hateful to God the impiety of Balaam was, this did not prevent Him from making use of him in this particular act. This <em>meeting </em>him, then, was by no means a proof of His favor, as if he approved of the seven altars, and sanctioned these superstitions; but as He well knows how to apply corrupt instruments to His use, so by the mouth of this false prophet, He promulgated the covenant, which He had made with Abraham, to foreign and heathen nations. </p><p>In truth, he boasts of his seven altars, as if he had duly propitiated God. Thus do hypocrites arrogantly trust that they deserve well of God, when they do but provoke His anger. God, however, passes over this corrupt worship, and proceeds with what He had determined; for He sends Balaam to be a proclaimer and witness of the sureness of His grace towards His chosen people. He supplies, indeed, His servants with what they speak, and controls their tongues; for neither would they be sufficient to think anything, unless the ability were bestowed by Him; and no one can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Still the holy Prophets were in suchwise organs of the Spirit, that they gave forth from the heart the treasures which God had deposited with them. In this view, Jeremiah says that he “did eat the words of God,” (<span class="bvs">Jer_15:16</span>;) and Ezekiel, that he ate the roll on which his prophecies were written. (<span class="bvs">Eze_3:1</span>.) For we must not conceive an inspiration (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐνθουσιασμὸς</span>) such as that by which the heathens supposed their diviners to be carried away, so that the heavenly <em>afflatus </em>transported them, or threw them into ecstasies; but rather did that take place in them, which David declares of himself: “I believed, therefore have I spoken,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_116:10</span> :) and God illuminated their senses before He guided their tongues. The case of Balaam was different, whose mind was alienated while he delivered the words which were put into his mouth. <span class="cite-ref">(156)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(156)</span> Addition in <em>Fr.; </em>“comme une pie en cage, ainsi qu’on dit;” like pie in a cage, as they say. </p></div></div>
