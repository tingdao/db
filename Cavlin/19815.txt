<div class="comment-content"><p>Now follows the message: The Prophet had, indeed, said that the word of God had been committed to him, but he interposed this narrative, that we might know for what reason God had sent this message to the Jews. For if he had thus begun, “The word came to Jeremiah from Jehovah,” and then added, “Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I have made a covenant,” etc., the passage would have been more obscure. It was therefore necessary that the narrative should come first, and with this the Prophet’s message was connected, even that the Jews had added perjury to cruelty, and thus had committed a heinous iniquity. The Prophet now then comes to close quarters with them, and introduces God as the speaker, <em>I made a covenant with your fathers the day I brought them up from the land of Egypt, from the house of servants </em></p><p>God reminded the Jews of their own law; and though he might have justly required whatever he pleased, yet he proved that the Israelites were bound to him, because he <em>brought then, out of the house of servants </em>Who can dare to arrogate to himself dominion over others, who is himself a servant? for there cannot be dominion where there is no liberty. Any one may be free, though without a servant; but no one can be a master except he be free. So God declares that the Israelites were not once free, for they were in a miserable state of servitude, when he stretched out his hand to them. Whence then came liberty to the Israelites? even from the gratuitous mercy of God, who made them free, who brought them forth from tyranny in Egypt. It hence follows, that they could not be masters over others, since they themselves were servants. This is the reason why he says that he <em>made a covenant the day he brought them up from the house of servants, </em>as though he had said, that they came forth from their prisons, because he had been pleased to draw them out, not that they might domineer for ever over their brethren, but only for a time. He relates here the law given by Moses in <span class="bvs">Exo_21:0</span>, as we have stated. At <em>the end of seven, years </em><span class="cite-ref">(94)</span><em>every one shall set free his brother, a Hebrew, who had been sold to him, and him who has served him six years he shall let free from him, </em>that is, that he should not be with him; <em>but your fathers hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear </em>The Israelites at first, no doubt, submitted to what God had commanded, but shortly after the law was disregarded. When, therefore, he complains here that his voice was not hearkened to, it ought not to be so generally understood, as that the Law had been at all times disregarded; but it is the same as though he had said, “Your fathers formerly were disobedient, because they did not set free their servants within the prescribed time, at the end of the sixth year.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(94)</span> It is said afterwards that for <em>six </em>years was the servitude to be, and yet the statement here is, “at the <em>end </em>of seven years.” Were it not for two other places, (<span class="bvs">Deu_15:1</span>,) where we find the same words, we might follow the <em>Sept. </em>and the <em>Arab., </em>and read <em>six </em>instead of <em>seven. </em>The Rabbins remove the difficulty by saying that the word, <span class="lang he-il">קף</span>, means the commencing, as well as the terminating end or extremity; so the meaning then would be, “at the beginning of seven years;” and this would agree with the <em>six </em>years afterwards mentioned. And this is the best explanation of the passage. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
