<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>And his tabernacle was in Salem </em>Here the reason is assigned why God, putting the Assyrians to flight, vouchsafed to deliver the city of Jerusalem, and to take it under his protection. The reason is, because he had there chosen for himself a dwelling-place, in which his name was to be called upon. The amount, in short, is, first, that men had no ground to arrogate to themselves any share in the deliverance of the city here portrayed, God having strikingly showed that all the glory was his own, by displaying from heaven his power in the sight of all men; and, secondly, that he was induced to oppose his enemies from no other consideration but that of his free choice of the Jewish nation. God having, by this example, testified that his power is invincible for preserving his Church, it is a call and an encouragement to all the faithful to repose with confidence under his shadow. If his name is precious to himself, it is no ordinary pledge and security which he gives to our faith when he assures us that it is his will that the greatness of his power should be known in the preservation of his Church. Moreover, as the Church is a distinguished theater on which the Divine glory is displayed, we must always take the greatest care not to shroud or bury in forgetfulness, by our ingratitude, the benefits which have been bestowed upon it, and especially those which ought to be held in remembrance in all ages. Farther, although God is not now worshipped in the visible tabernacle, yet as by Christ he still dwells in the midst of us, yea even within us, we will doubtless experience, whenever we are exposed to danger, that under his protection we are in perfect safety. If the earthly sanctuary of Jerusalem afforded to God’s ancient people succor while it stood, we may rest assured that he will have no less care of us who live in the present day, when we consider that he has vouchsafed to choose us as his temples in which he may dwell by his Holy Spirit. Here the prophet, in speaking of Jerusalem, uses merely the name of <em>Salem, </em>which was the simple and uncompounded name of the city, and had been applied to it very anciently, as appears from <span class="bvs">Gen_14:18</span>. Some think that the name in the course of time assumed its compound form, by having <em>Jebus </em>prefixed to <em>Salem; </em>for Jebus was the name by which it was afterwards known in the intervening period, as we learn from the Book of Judges, <span class="bvs">Jud_19:10</span>, it being so called because it was inhabited by the Jebusites. But we will be more correct as to the etymology of the word, if we derive it from the verb <span class="lang he-il">יראה</span>, <em>yereh, </em>which signifies <em>will see, </em><span class="cite-ref">(267)</span> because Abraham said, </p><p>“God will look out for himself a lamb for a burnt-offering,” (<span class="bvs">Gen_22:8</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(267)</span> From <span class="lang he-il">ראה</span>, <em>raäh</em>, <em>he saw</em>, or <em>beheld </em></p></div></div>
