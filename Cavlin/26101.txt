<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>His mother saith to the servants. </em>Here the holy Virgin gives an instance of true obedience which she owed to her Son, <span class="cite-ref">(47)</span> when the question related, not to the relative duties of mankind, but to his divine power. She modestly acquiesces, therefore, in Christ’s reply; and in like manner exhorts others to comply with his injunctions. I acknowledge, indeed, that what the Virgin now said related to the present occurrence, and amounted to a declaration that, in this instance, she had no authority, and that Christ would do, according to his own pleasure, whatever he thought right. But if you attend closely to her design, the statement which she made is still more extensive; for she first disclaims and lays aside the power which she might seem to have improperly usurped; and next, she ascribes the whole authority to Christ, when she bids them<em>do whatever he shall command. </em>We are taught generally by these words, that if we desire any thing from Christ, we will not obtain our wishes, unless we depend on him alone, look to him, and, in short, <em>do whatever he commands </em>On the other hand, he does not send us to his mother, but rather invites us to himself. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(47)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">a son Fils</span>.” </p></div></div>
