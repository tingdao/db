<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles </em>He has spoken above of dissembling in connection with idolatry, or, at least, as to those actions which the Corinthians could not engage in, without professing themselves to be the associates of the wicked in their superstitions. He now requires them, not merely to abstain from all professions of idolatry, but also to avoid carefully all occasions of offense, which are wont to arise from the indiscriminate use of things indifferent. For, although there was but one kind of offense on the part of the Corinthians, <span class="cite-ref">(595)</span> there were, at the same time different degrees of it. Now, as to the eating of food, he makes, in the <em>first </em>place, this general statement — that it is lawful to eat, with a safe <em>conscience</em>, any kind of food, because the Lord permits it. In the <em>second </em>place, he restricts this liberty as to the use of it — lest weak consciences should be injured. Thus this conclusion is divided into two parts the <em>first </em>relates to liberty and power as to things indifferent: the <em>second </em>to a limitation of it — that the use of it may be regulated in accordance with the rule of love. </p><p><em>Debating nothing </em><span class="cite-ref">(596)</span><span class="lang el-gr">᾿Ανακρίνεσθαι</span>, the word that Paul makes use of, means to reason on both sides, <span class="cite-ref">(597)</span> in such a way, that the person’s mind vacillates, inclining now to this side, and then to that. <span class="cite-ref">(598)</span> Accordingly, in so far as concerns a distinction of meats, he frees our consciences from all scruple and hesitation; because it is proper that, when we are certain from the word of the Lord that he approves of what we do, we should have ease and tranquillity in our minds. </p><p><em>For conscience sake </em>— that is to say, Before the judgment-seat of God — “In so far as you have to do with God, there is no occasion for your disputing with yourself, whether it be lawful or not. For I allow you to eat freely of all kinds of meat, because the Lord allows you everything without exception.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(595)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car combien que les Corinthiens faissent en cela plusieurs fautes qui estoyent toutes comprises sous vne generalite</span>;” — “For although the Corinthians in this case committed many faults which were all comprehended under one general description.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(596)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sans en enquerir rien</span>;” — “Without asking any question as to it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(597)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Debatre en son entendement </span><em class="lang fr-fr">pour et contre</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, comme on dit</span>;” — “To debate in one’s mind <em>for </em>and <em>against</em>, as they say. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(598)</span><span class="lang el-gr">᾿Ανακρίνω</span>, properly means to <em>examine narrowly </em>It is stated by <em>Bloomfield</em>, that “the best recent Commentators consider the expression <span class="lang el-gr">μηδὲν ἀνακρίνοντες, </span> as put for <span class="lang el-gr">μηδὲν κρέας </span> (that is, <span class="lang el-gr">κρέατος γένος</span>) <span class="lang el-gr">ἀνακρίνοντες</span>, examining no kind of meat, to see whether it be idol-meat or not.” This interpretation is natural, and agrees particularly well with the expression, as repeated in the 27<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
