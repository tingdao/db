It is true, that “the way of all the earth” is an expression used sometimes to denote death, which is common to all, but the verb here translated to <em>lead </em>is more commonly taken in a good than a bad sense, and I question if the phrase <em>way of this life </em>ever means death. <span class="cite-ref">(221)</span> It seems evidently to denote the full continuous term of human life, and David prays God to guide him even to the end of his course. I am aware some understand it to refer to eternal life, nor is it denied that the world to come is comprehended under the full term of life to which the Psalm~ ist alludes, but it seems enough to hold by the plain sense of the words, That God would watch over his servant to whom he had already shown kindness to the end, and not forsake him in the midst of his days. </p><p><strong>(221)</strong> On the margin of the French Commentary Calvin refers to <span class="bvs">Jos_23:14</span>. </p></div>
