<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>To be a memorial unto the children of Israel. </em>This passage again confirms what I have just said, that God’s judgments, which ought to remain in full remembrance in every age, straightway escape, and are blotted out front men’s minds, unless they are provided with certain aids to meditate upon them. This, however, does not happen so much from ignorance as neglect. Wherefore we ought to be the more attentive to the aids to memory, which may retain us in the path of duty. </p></div>
