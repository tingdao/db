<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>As for the head, etc</em>. There may be a doubt whether, under the term head, he refers to the chief of the faction opposed to him; for we call suppose an inversion in the sentence, and a change of the plural to the singular number, bringing out this sense. <span class="cite-ref">(229)</span> “Let the mischief of their wicked speeches, which they intended against me, fall upon their own head.” <span class="cite-ref">(230)</span> As almost all interpreters, however, have taken the other view, I have adopted it, only understanding the reference as being to Saul rather than Doeg. There follows an imprecation upon the whole company of his enemies generally, that <em>coals may fall upon them</em>, alluding to the awful fate of Sodom and Gomorrha. We find this elsewhere (<span class="bvs">Psa_11:6</span>) set forth by the Spirit of God as an example of Divine vengeance, to terrify the wicked; and Jude (<span class="bvs">Jud_1:7</span>) declares that God testified, by this example of everlasting significance, that he would be the Judge of all the ungodly. Some translate what follows — <em>the wilt cast them into the fire</em>, which might pass. But as: <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, <em>beth</em>, in the Hebrew often denotes instrumentality, we may properly render the words — <em>thou wilt cast them down </em>By <em>fire</em>, or With <em>fire</em>, as God sent it forth against Sodom and Gomorrha. He prays they may be sunk into deep pits, whence they may never rise. God sometimes heals those whom he has smitten with great severity; David cuts off the reprobate from the hope of pardon, as knowing them to be beyond recovery. Had they been disposable to repentance, he would have been inclinable on his part to mercy. </p><p><strong>(229)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car il pourreit estre que l’ordre des mots seroit renverse, et que le nombre singulier seroit mis pour le pluriel, en ce sens</span>,” etc. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(230)</strong> “The meaning of the verse may be, that the mischief designed by the wicked against others shall fall on their own head, as <span class="bvs">Psa_7:17</span>, ‘his violence shall descend on his own head;’ or it may express the leader of the hostile party, as Saul or Doeg, in the case of David being here the speaker.” — <em>Phillips</em>. </p></div>
