<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>And he went out. </em>We have stated why the holy Prophet went out from the king to pray, viz., because he was not worthy that the sacred name of God should be invoked in his presence. Therefore Moses did not offer prayer for him, because he thought him to be really converted, but that he might open God’s way for the remaining contests. If, indeed, a choice had been given to the holy man, I do not doubt that he would have been disposed by his extraordinary kindness of heart, willingly to provide for the tyrant’s safety; but, since he had heard the revelation of his desperate obstinacy, he was only intent on manifesting the power of God. Nor is there any question that he prayed under the special impulse of the Spirit, until he was assured of the final act; and the event proves that his prayers were not vainly cast into the air, because the land was immediately cleared of the locusts. We must have the same opinion with respect to the west wind as we have lately advanced respecting the opposite wind; for a temporary blast would not have been sufficient to dissipate so vast and filthy a host; but, in both cases, God testified by a visible token that he was influenced by the prayers of His servant, and that on this account the plague was stayed. It is sufficiently well known that the Arabian Gulf is called by the name of the Red Sea. By the Hebrews it is called <span class="lang he-il">סוף</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(123)</span><em>suph, </em>either from the reeds or rushes with which it abounds, or from its whirlwinds; since this word is used in Scripture in both senses. <span class="cite-ref">(124)</span> If, therefore, you choose to translate it into Latin it must be called “Mare algosum et junceum,” or “turbinosum.” (The weedy and rushy sea, or the tempestuous sea.) But, since there is something monstrous and incredible in such raving obstinacy, it is expressly stated that his heart was hardened by God; that we may learn to tremble at that terrible judgment, when the wicked, seized by a spirit of madness, do not hesitate to provoke more and more that God whose name overwhelms them with terror. </p><p><strong>(123)</strong><span class="lang he-il">סוף</span>, sea-weed, <span class="lang he-il">סופה</span>, or tempest. In Luther’s German, <em>Schilfmeer </em>preserves the original meaning of the Hebrew name for the Red Sea. — <em>W. </em></p><p><strong>(124)</strong> Addition in <em>Fr</em>. , “C’est par ou les enfans d’ Israel ont depuis passe comme nous verrons;” the children of Israel afterwards passed through it, as we shall see. </p></div>
