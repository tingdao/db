<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Make good</em>, he says, <em>your ways and your doings, then will I dwell in this place </em><span class="cite-ref">(189)</span> This promise contains an implied contrast; for the Prophet intimates, that the people would not long survive, unless they sought in another way to pacify God. “I will dwell, “he seems to say, — in this place, when your life is changed.” It then follows on the other hand, “God will drive you into exile, except you change your life: in vain then do you seek a quiet and happy state through offering your sacrifices.
