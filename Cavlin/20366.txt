<div class="comment-content"><p>In this verse also the Prophet shews how grievously the faithful are disturbed when they feel that God is adverse to them. But he uses the same figure as yesterday, though the word <span class="lang he-il">סורר</span>, <em>surer, </em>is different: what he used yesterday was <span class="lang he-il">עוה</span>, <em>oue</em>, but in the same sense. </p><p>He then says that his ways had been perverted; <span class="cite-ref">(177)</span> and for this reason, because he had been disappointed in his purpose; whatever he did was made void, because God by force prevented him. When we undertake to do anything, a way is open to us; but when there is no success, our way is said to be perverted. And this is done by God, who has all events, prosperous as well as adverse, in his own hand. As, then, God directs our ways when he blesses our counsels and our actions; so, on the other hand, he perverts them, when all things turn out unsuccessfully, when our purpose is not done and events do not answer our expectations. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>He hath torn me </em>or broken me. The verb <span class="lang he-il">פשח</span>, <em>peshech, </em>means properly to cut, but here to tear or scatter. It follows lastly, <em>he hath made me a waste </em>In this expression he includes the other two things; for he who is reduced to desolation, does not hold on his way, nor find any exit; he is also drawn here and there, as though he was torn into several parts. We hence see that the Prophet here complains of extreme evils, for there was no hope of deliverance left. He adds, — </p><p><strong>(177)</strong> The word, having the last letter doubled, means to turn aside again and again, “He has often turned aside my ways.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
