<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong>Luke doth at length declare that certain of them brought this treasure even unto the Gentiles. And Luke calleth these Grecians not <span class="lang el-gr">Ελληνες</span>, but <span class="lang el-gr">Ελληνισται</span>. Therefore, some say that those came of the Jews, yet did they inhabit Greece; which I do not allow. For seeing the Jews, whom he mentioned a little before, were partly of Cyprus, they must needs be reckoned in that number, because the Jews count Cyprus a part of Greece. But Luke distinguisheth them from those, whom he calleth afterward <span class="lang el-gr">Ελληνιστας</span>. Furthermore, forasmuch as he had said that the word was preached at the beginning only to the Jews, and he meant those who, being banished out of their own country, did live in Cyprus and Phenice, correcting as it were this exception, he saith that some of them did teach the Grecians. This contrariety doth cause me to expound it of the Gentiles. For Luke’s meaning is, that a few did more freely preach the gospel, <span class="cite-ref">(738)</span> because the calling of the Gentiles was not unknown to them. But the constancy of them all deserveth no small praise; because, being delivered, as it were, out of the midst of death, they are not afraid to do their duty toward God even with danger. Whence we gather to what end, and how far forth Christians may fly persecution; to wit, that they may spend <span class="cite-ref">(739)</span> the residue of their life in spreading abroad the glory of God. If any man demand how it came to pass that strangers lately coming, and such as might have been suspected among all the Jews, and hated of them, because they were banished out of Jerusalem, were so bold, I answer, that this came to pass through the singular motion of God, and that they consulted suddenly according to the occasion offered them. For this deliberation is not of flesh and blood. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(738)</span> “Evangelii doctrinam sparsisse,” did spread the doctrine of the gospel. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(739)</span> “Strenue impendant,” may strenously spend. </p></div></div>
