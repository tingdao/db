<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25</strong><em>I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus</em>. After having encouraged them by the promise of his own coming and that of Timothy, he fortifies them also for the present, by sending previously Epaphroditus, that in the mean time, while he waited the issue of his own affairs, (for this was the cause of his delay,) they might not be in want of a pastor who should take care that matters were properly managed. Now, he recommends Epaphroditus by many distinctions — that he is his <em>brother</em>, and helper in the affairs of the gospel — that he is his <em>fellow-soldier</em>, by which term he intimates what is the condition of the ministers of the gospel; that they are engaged in an incessant warfare, for Satan will not allow them to promote the gospel without maintaining a conflict. Let those, then, who prepare themselves for edifying the Church, know that war is denounced against them, and prepared. This, indeed, is common to all Christians — to be soldiers in the camp of Christ, <span class="cite-ref">(150)</span> for Satan is the enemy of all. It is, however, more particularly applicable to the ministers of the word, who go before the army and bear the standard. Paul, however, more especially might boast of his military service, <span class="cite-ref">(151)</span> inasmuch as he was exercised to a very miracle in every kind of contest. He accordingly commends Epaphroditus, because he had been a companion to him in his conflicts. </p><p>The term <em>Apostle </em>here, as in many other passages, is taken generally to mean any evangelist, <span class="cite-ref">(152)</span> unless any one prefers to understand it as meaning an ambassador sent by the Philippians, so that it may be understood as conjoining these two things — an ambassador to afford service to Paul. <span class="cite-ref">(153)</span> The former signification, however, is in my opinion more suitable. He mentions also, among other things, to his praise, that he had <em>ministered to him in prison </em>— a matter which will be treated of more fully ere long. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(150)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De batailler sous l’enseigne de Christ</span>;” — “To fight under Christ’s banner.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(151)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">S.
