<div class="comment-content"><p>When the Prophet says that God <em>heard, </em>it is the same as though he said, that he had so prayed that God became a witness of his earnestness and solicitude; for many boast in high terms of their earnestness and fervor and constancy in prayer, but their boastings are all empty and vain. But the Prophet summons God as a witness of his crying, as though he had said that he was not so overwhelmed by his adversity, but that he always fled to God. </p><p>He then says, <em>Close not, </em>etc.; it is properly, “hide not;” but as this is not quite suitable to ears, I am disposed to give this version, Close not thine ear to my cry. The verb <span class="lang he-il">רוח</span><em>ruch</em>, means to dilate, to respire; hence almost all render the noun here, “breathing;” but what follows cannot admit of this sense, <em>to my prayer </em>or cry. I have no doubt but that these two words mean crying; for in groaning the spirit of man dilates itself, and the soul, compressed by grief, expands. But when we cast our cares and troubles into the bosom of God, then the spirit forcibly emerges. This, then, is what the Prophet means, when he asks God <em>not to close his ear to his dilation or groaning, and to his cry. </em><span class="cite-ref">(202)</span> It follows, — </p><p><strong>(202)</strong> Materially correct, no doubt, is this explanation. We may give this version, — </p><p>My voice hast thou heard, deafen not thy ear <LineBreak />To my sighing, to my cry. </p><p>The verb <span class="lang he-il">עלם</span> means to veil, and hence to hide. To veil the eye is, not to look at what is set before it; and to veil the ear is, to render it deaf to what is said. The Prophet says that God had heard his voice, for he had prayed; but he further asks God not to turn a deaf ear to his sighing, or sobbing, as given by the <em>Vulg</em>, and to his cry. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
