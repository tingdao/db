<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_9:22</span><strong>.</strong><em>Take courage, my daughter. </em>This expression shows the weakness of her faith for, had there been no impropriety in her <em>trembling, </em>Christ would not have corrected it by exhorting her to <em>take courage </em>Yet, at the same time, he commends her <em>faith; </em>and this supports the view which I have already stated, that, while she sought Christ by the guidance of the Spirit, and from a sincere and pious desire, she hesitated in such a manner as to need to be strengthened. Thus we see that faith, in order to please God, needs forgiveness, and is at the same time sustained by new aid, that it may acquire additional strength. We may here draw a comparison from the health of the body to that of the soul: for, as Christ says that the womanâ€™s deliverance from her disease was the consequence of her <em>faith, </em>so it is certain, that we obtain by faith the forgiveness of sins, which reconciles us to God. </p></div>
