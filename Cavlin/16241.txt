<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>O Jehovah! thou hast searched me </em>David declares, in the outset of this Psalm, that he does not come before God with any idea of its being possible to succeed by dissimulation, as hypocrites will take advantage of secret refuges to prosecute sinful indulgences, but that he voluntarily lays bare his innermost heart for inspection, as one convinced of the impossibility of deceiving God. It is thine, he says, O God! to discover every secret thought, nor is there anything which can escape thy notice, He then insists upon particulars, to show that his whole life was known to God, who watched him in all his motions — when he slept, when he arose, or when he walked abroad. The word <span class="lang he-il">רע</span><em>, rea, </em>which we have rendered <em>thought, </em>signifies also a <em>friend </em>or<em>companion, </em>on which account some read —<em>thou knowest what is nearest me afar </em>off, a meaning more to the point than any other, if it could be supported by example. The reference would then be very appropriately to the fact that the most distant objects are contemplated as near by God. Some for<em>afar off </em>read <em>beforehand, </em>in which signification the Hebrew word is elsewhere taken, as if he had said — O Lord, every thought which I conceive in my heart is already known to thee beforehand. But I prefer the other meaning, That God is not confined to heaven, indulging in a state of repose, and indifferent to human concerns, according to the Epicurean idea, and that however far off we may be from him, he is never far off from us. </p><p>The verb <span class="lang he-il">זרה</span>, <em>zarah, </em>means to <em>winnow </em>as well as to <em>compass, </em>so that we may <em>very </em>properly read the third verse — <em>thou winnowest my ways, </em><span class="cite-ref">(201)</span> a figurative expression to denote the bringing of anything which is unknown to light. The reader is left to his own option, for the other rendering which I have adopted is also.appropriate. There has been also a difference of opinion amongst interpreters as to the last clause of the verse. The verb <span class="lang he-il">סכן</span>, <em>sachan, </em>in the Hiphil conjugation, as here, signifies to <em>render successful, </em>which has led some to think that David here thanks God for crowning his actions with success; but this is a sense which does not at all suit the scope of the Psalmist in the context, for he is not speaking of thanksgiving. Equally forced is the meaning given to the words by others — Thou hast made me to get acquainted or accustomed with my ways; <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span> as if he praised God for being endued with wisdom and counsel. Though the verb be in the Hiphil, I have therefore felt no hesitation in assigning it a neuter signification — Lord, thou art accustomed to my ways, so that they are familiar to thee. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(201)</span> Piscator, Campensis, Pagninus, Luther, and our English Version, read “thou compassest.” This no doubt gives the meaning, of the original, though not the precise idea, which is noticed on the margin of our English Bible to be “winnowest.” <em>The </em>verb <span class="lang he-il">זרה</span><em>, zarah, </em>employed, signifies <em>to disperse, to fan, to ventilate, to winnow; </em>and here it denotes that as men separate the corn from the chaff, so God separates between, or investigates, the good and the bad in the daily conduct of men. Hence the Septuagint reads <span class="lang el-gr">ἐξιχνίασας</span>, “thou hast investigated.” Bishop Hare, who renders “thou dost compass,” supposes it to be a metaphor taken from hunting. “Winnowing,” says Archbishop Secker,” would sound uncouth But Mudge hath hit on the word <em>siftest, </em>which, though an idea somewhat different, suits very well.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(202)</span> “Fecisti assuescere vias meas.” —<em>Lat. </em></p></div></div>
