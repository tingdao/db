<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>Exult, ye Gentiles, with his people </em>This verse is commonly considered as if it was taken from the song of Moses; but with this I cannot agree; for Moses’ design there was to terrify the adversaries of Israel by setting forth his greatness, rather than to invite them to a common joy. I hence think that this is quoted from <span class="bvs">Psa_47:5</span>, where it is written, “Exult and rejoice let the Gentiles, because thou judgest the nations in equity, and the Gentiles on the earth thou guidest.” And Paul adds, <em>with his people, </em>and he did this by way of explanation; for the Prophet in that psalm no doubt connects the Gentiles with Israel, and invites both alike to rejoice; and there is no joy without the knowledge of God. <span class="cite-ref">(447)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(447)</span> This passage is evidently taken from <span class="bvs">Deu_32:43</span>, given literally as it is found in the Septuagint, and literally too from the Hebrew, if the reading of two copies, referred to by <em>Kennicalt</em>, be adopted, in which <span class="lang he-il">את</span>, “with,” is placed before <span class="lang he-il">עשו</span>, “his people.” It is no objection that “adversaries” are mentioned in the context. There have ever been adversaries to God’s people; and God even now denounces his judgments on his adversaries, though the Gentiles as a people, as a separate class from the Jews, have been long ago admitted to the privilege of rejoicing with his people. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
