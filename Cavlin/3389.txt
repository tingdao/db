<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>“Unto your acceptance.” </em><span class="cite-ref">(294)</span> Some indeed translate this “at your own will,” but the context forbids it; for Moses sometimes uses the word <span class="lang he-il">רצה</span>, <em>ratseh, </em>which means “accepted,” in the same sense, and sometimes <span class="lang he-il">רצון</span>, <em>ratson, </em>which can only be referred to God’s favor, which is commonly called His “good pleasure.” Again, as he here uses the compound word <span class="lang he-il">לרצנכם</span>; <em>leretsoncem, </em>so he soon afterwards adds <span class="lang he-il">לרצון לכם</span>, <em>leretson lecem, </em>where he declares that a blemished sacrifice would not be “unto their acceptance,” because it would be rejected by God. The sum therefore is, that if they desire their oblations to be approved by God, they must beware that there be no defect in them. Still, if any one chooses to think that God’s gratuitous favor is expressed by the word “good pleasure,” I willingly admit it, since our services only please God in so far as in His paternal indulgence He deigns to award to them the value of which they are by no means worthy. Nevertheless let us learn meanwhile that we must not play with God, but that He must be so worshipped in integrity and sincerity of heart as that our sacrifices may correspond with His good pleasure. For hence arises the careless profanation of His worship, because we do not sufficiently consider what is due to His perfection. It is indeed certain that nothing can proceed from us which is pure in every respect; but let us at least aspire at what befits us, and let us mourn that our desires fall so far short of their aim, in order that Christ may by His grace supply what is wanting in US; for it is unquestionable that, provided our sacrifices are the fruits of true regeneration, He washes out their blemishes with His own blood. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(294)</span><em>A.V. </em>“At your own will,” <em>vide supra, </em>p. 370. </p></div></div>
