<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>They shall rejoice. </em>In making mention here of joy, jubilee, and the high praises of God, he shows still more clearly from the effects which it would produce, that he does not speak of a common benefit of God; for had not the deliverance of the people been of a remarkable kind, there would have been no occasion for such joy<em>, </em>and even triumph. And by these expressions he intimates that the people would not be brought back from exile to be immediately dispersed again, but to flourish in the enjoyment of every species of blessing. He on this account makes mention of <em>couches, </em>teaching them to expect daily rest under the divine protection. He declares that they would be furnished with arms and power, not only to ward off enemies, but to put them to flight on every side, so as to reduce to subjection kings and nations which formerly ruled over them. By <em>swords of a double-mouth, </em>or <em>two-edged, </em>are meant such as cut on both sides, for at that time swords had but one edge. </p></div>
