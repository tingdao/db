<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>43.</strong><em>But when the unclean spirit hath gone out. </em>He speaks of scribes and hypocrites of a similar character, who, despising the grace of God, enter into a conspiracy with the devil. Against such persons he pronounces that punishment which their ingratitude deserves. To make his doctrine more extensively useful, he points out, in a general manner, the condemnation that awaits those who, despising the grace offered to them, again open the door to the devil. But as almost every particle has great weight, there are some points that must be noticed in their order, before we come to treat the substance of the parable. </p><p>What Christ says about the <em>going out </em>of the devil is intended to magnify the power and efficacy of the grace of God. Whenever God draws near to us, and, above all, when he approaches us in the person of his Son, the design is, to rescue us from the tyranny of the devil, and to receive us into his favor. This had been openly declared by Christ in the miracle which he had lately performed. As it is the peculiar office of Christ to banish wicked spirits, that they may no longer reign over men, the devil is justly said to <em>go out of </em>those men to whom Christ exhibits himself as a Redeemer. Though the presence of Christ is not efficacious to all, because unbelievers render it useless to them, yet he intended to point out why he visits us, what is implied in his coming, and how it is regarded by wicked spirits; for in every case in which Christ operates on men, the devils are drawn into a contest with him, and sink beneath his power. Let us, therefore, hold it to be a settled point, that the devil is cast out of us, whenever Christ shines upon us, and displays his grace towards us by some manifestation. </p><p><em>Secondly</em>, the wretched condition of the whole human race is here described to us; for it follows that the devil has a residence within man, since he is driven from it by the Son of God. Now what is here said relates not to one individual or to another, but to the whole posterity of Adam. And this is the glory of our nature, that the devil has his seat within us, and inhabits both the body and the soul. So much the more illustrious is the display of the mercy of God, when we, who were the loathsome dens of the devil, are made temples to Himself, and consecrated for a habitation of His Spirit. </p><p><em>Thirdly</em>, we have here a description of Satan’s nature. He never ceases to do us injury, but is continually busy, and moves from one place to another. In a word, he directs all his efforts to accomplish our destruction; and above all, when he has been vanquished and put to flight by Christ, it only tends more to whet his rage and keenness to do us injury. <span class="cite-ref">(144)</span> Before Christ makes us partakers of his energy, it seems as if it were in sport and amusement that this enemy reigns over us; <span class="cite-ref">(145)</span> but when he has been driven out, he conceives resentment at having lost his prey, collects new forces, and arouses all his senses to attack us anew. </p><p><em>He walketh through dry places. </em>This is a metaphorical expression, and denotes that to dwell out of men is to him a wretched banishment, and resembles a barren wilderness. Such, too, is the import of the phrase, <em>seeking rest, </em>so long as he dwells out of men; for then he is displeased and tormented, and ceases not to labor by one means or by another, till he recover what he has lost. <span class="cite-ref">(146)</span> Let us, therefore, learn that, as soon as Christ calls us, a sharper and fiercer contest is prepared for us. Though he meditates the destruction of all, and though the words of Peter apply to all without exception, that he </p><p>goeth about as a roaring lion, and seeketh whom he may devour, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Pe_5:8</span>,) </p><p>yet we are plainly taught by these words of Christ, that Satan views with deeper hatred, and attacks with greater fierceness and rage, those who have been rescued from his snares. Such an admonition, however, ought not to inspire us with terror, but to arouse us to keep diligent watch, and to put on the spiritual armor, that we may make a brave resistance. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(144)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il aiguise tant plus son appetit enrage de nous mal-faire</span>;” — “so much the more does it whet his enraged appetite to do us injury.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(145)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce mal-heureux ennemi nous manie tout a son aise, et regne en nous comme en se iouant</span>;” — “this unhappy foe governs us altogether at his ease, and reigns over us, as it were, in sport.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(146)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Iusques a ce qu’il retrouve la proye qu’on luy a ostee d’entremains</span>;” — “till he recover the prey that has been snatched out of his hands.” </p></div></div>
