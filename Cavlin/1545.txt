<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>But the more. </em>Moses relates the contest between the mercy of God and the cruelty of the king of Egypt. When, therefore, the wretched Israelites were tyrannically afflicted, he says that God came to their aid, and so powerfully that his interference was successful. Thus was that wicked and deceitful design frustrated, which the Egyptians had set on foot for destroying the Church. Thence may we, too, conceive the hope, that whatsoever the wicked imagine against us will come to nought, because God’s hand is greater, and shall prevail. But we must bear afflictions patiently, because he would have us struggle against, and rise under the weight imposed upon us; <span class="cite-ref">(16)</span> and because we know that it is the peculiar office of God to oppose himself to unjust counsels, in order that they may not succeed, let us learn to abstain from all deceit and violence, lest we wantonly provoke God. But this passage is especially intended to console the believer, that he may be prepared to take up his cross more patiently; since God is sufficient to supply the help, to which the wrath of the wicked must finally yield. What is said in the second part of the verse, that the Egyptians <span class="cite-ref">(17)</span> were grieved, means, that they became more anxious, as they saw that they availed nothing, and that their unexpected increase threatened still greater danger; for, since they feared the Israelites before they had afflicted them, no wonder that they felt alarmed lest they should avenge themselves when provoked. And hence the profitable instruction may be gathered, that while the wicked proceed to horrible crimes in order to insure their safety, the Almighty visits them with the very just return, that thus their anxiety is augmented. Some render it, “the Egyptians hated the people of Israel;” and so the word <span class="lang he-il">קוף</span>, <em>kutz</em>, is sometimes taken, but the construction of the passage demands the rendering which I have given. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(16)</span> “A la facon de la palme;” like the palm-tree. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(17)</span><span class="lang he-il">ויקצו</span>, <em>C</em>. , <em>And they were burdened with anxiety </em>In <em>A V</em>. , <em>And they were grieved </em>The verb <span class="lang he-il">קוף</span> is generally taken for <em>to loathe </em>— <em>W </em></p></div></div>
