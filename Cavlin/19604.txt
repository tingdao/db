<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Serve him shall all nations, and his son, and the son of his son </em>The greater part think that Nebuchadnezzar had only two successors of his own posterity, Evil-merodach and Belshazar; others name five, and two of them between Evil-merodach and Belshazar. Those who think that there were no more than three, quote this testimony of the Prophet, for he names only the king’s son and his grandson; but this would be no sufficient reason. I am, however, disposed to follow what has been more commonly received, that Belshazar, the last king of Babylon, who was slain by Cyrus, was the third from Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cite-ref">(181)</span></p><p>But this is not the main thing; for the Prophet speaks of the time of the Chaldean monarchy as well as of the king, <em>until the time of his land shall come. </em>The time of the land was that determined by heaven; for as to every one of us there is a limit fixed beyond which no one can pass, so we ought to judge of kingdoms. As, then, the life of every individual has its fixed limits, so God has determined with regard to the empires of the whole earth; thus the life and death of every kingdom and nation are in the hand and at the will of God. For this reason it is now said, that the <em>time </em>of Chaldea would <em>come, </em>and then it is added, <em>and of the king himself. </em><span class="cite-ref">(182)</span> This ought not to be confined to Nebuchadnezzar himself; but as his grandson represented him, the time, though not strictly, may yet be aptly said to have been that, when God had put an end to him and to his power when Babylon was taken by the Medes and Persians. This was, however, at the same time for the comfort of the godly; for it was not God’s design to leave the faithful without some alleviation in their trouble, lest grief should overpower them; when they found themselves oppressed by the Chaldeans, and in a manner overwhelmed, doubtless despair might have crept in, and hence murmurings and blasphemies might have followed. It was, therefore, God’s purpose to mitigate in some measure their bitterness when he added, that the <em>time </em>of Nebuchadnezzar himself <em>would come, </em>that is, the time in which he was to perish. When, therefore, the faithful saw him taking possession of all lands, and dreaded by all nations, they were not to despond, but rather to extend their thoughts to that time of which Jeremiah had predicted, that they might receive some alleviation to their grief, and be enabled to bear with more resignation the cross laid on them. In this expression, then, is included a promise; for the hope of deliverance was set before them, when they understood that reverses would soon happen to King Nebuchadnezzar. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>serve him shall great, </em>or many <em>nations </em>(for the word <span class="lang he-il">רבים</span>, <em>rebim, </em>means both) <em>and great kings </em><span class="cite-ref">(183)</span> This was distinctly expressed, that no conspiracy might deceive the Jews and other nations; for they thought that when united together they could offer an effectual resistance: “Accumulate your forces and your efforts,” says God; “yet all these shall be dissipated; for my decree is, that great kings and many nations shall serve the Chaldeans.” It follows — </p><p><strong>(181)</strong> It seems that there were two besides, who exercised for a time regal power, but they were not the descendants of Nebuchadnezzar. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(182)</strong> This is rendered differently, “until the time of his land, even his, shall come.” So the early versions, and so Venema and Blayney. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(183)</strong> Here Calvin has followed the Vulg.; but our version gives the true meaning. See note on <span class="bvs">Jer_25:14</span>. The two clauses may be thus translated, “Until the time of his land, even his, shall come; then reduce him (or it, that is, land) to subjection, shall many nations and mighty kings.” Such substantially is the version of Venema and of Blayney, and also of Piscator and Junius. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
