<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>He that supplieth. </em>A beautieth circumlocution, in place of the term <em>God, </em>and full of consolation. <span class="cite-ref">(724)</span> For the person that sows seed in the proper season, appears when reaping to gather the fruit of his labor and industry, and sowing appears as though it were the fountainhead from which food flows forth to us. Paul opposes this idea, by maintaining that the seed is afforded and the food is furnished by the favor of God even to the husbandmen that sow, and who are looked upon as supporting themselves and others by their efforts. There is a similar statement in <span class="bvs">Deu_8:16</span> — </p><p>God fed thee with manna — food which thy fathers knew not: lest perhaps when thou hast come into the land which he shall give thee, thou shouldst say, My hand and my strength have gotten, me this wealth; for it is the Lord that giveth power to get wealth, etc. </p><p><em>Supply </em>Here there are two different readings, even in the Greek versions. For some manuscripts render the three verbs in the future — <em>will supply, will multiply, will increase. </em><span class="cite-ref">(725)</span> In this way, there would be a confirmation of the foregoing statement, for it is no rare thing with Paul to repeat the same promise in different words, that it may be the better impressed upon men’s minds. In other manuscripts these words occur in the infinitive mood, and it is well known that the infinitive is sometimes used in place of the optative. I rather prefer this reading, both because it is the more generally received one, and because Paul is accustomed to follow up his exhortations with prayers, entreating from God what he had previously comprised in his doctrine; though at the same time the former reading would not be unsuitable. </p><p><em>Bread for food </em>He mentions a two-fold fruit of the blessing of God upon us — <em>first</em>, that we have sufficiency for ourselves for the support of life; and, <em>secondly, </em>that we have something to lay up for relieving the necessities of others. For as we are not born for ourselves merely, <span class="cite-ref">(726)</span> so a Christian man ought neither to live to himself, nor lay out what he has, merely for his own use. </p><p>Under the terms <em>seed, </em>and <em>fruits of righteousness, </em>he refers to <em>alms. </em>The <em>fruits of righteousness </em>he indirectly contrasts with those returns that the greater number lay up in cellars, barns, and keeping-places, that they may, every one of them, cram in whatever they can gather, nay, scrape together, so as to enrich themselves. By the former term he expresses the means of doing good; by the <em>latter </em>the work itself, or office of love; <span class="cite-ref">(727)</span> for <em>righteousness </em>is taken here, by <em>synecdoche, </em>to mean <em>beneficence. </em>“May God not only supply you with what may be sufficient for every one’s private use, but also to such an extent, that the fountain of your liberality, ever flowing forth, may never be exhausted!” If, however, it is one department of <em>righteousness </em>— as assuredly it is not the least <span class="cite-ref">(728)</span> — to relieve the necessities of neighbors, those must be unrighteous who neglect this department of duty. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(724)</span> “The words <span class="lang el-gr">ὁ ἐπιχορηγῶν βρῶσιν </span> are a periphrasis of God (<em>i.e., </em>the <em>Good Being</em>) ‘who giveth us all things richly to enjoy.’ It is formed on <span class="bvs">Isa_55:10</span>.” — Bloomfield. — Ed. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(725)</span> “The Vatican MS. reads with the futures — <span class="lang el-gr">χορηγήσει </span> (<em>will supply,</em>)<span class="lang el-gr">πληθύνεῖ,</span> (<em>will supply,</em>) and <span class="lang el-gr">αὐξήσει,</span> (<em>will increase</em>) ” — <em>Penn. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(726)</span> Our Author has here very probably in his eye a celebrated passage in Horace — “Nos numerus sumus, et fruges consumere nati;” — “We do but add to the numbers of mankind, and seem born only to consume the fruits of the earth.” (Hot. <span class="cite-note">Ep. 1:2, 27</span>.) — Ed. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(727)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">L’assistance laquelle on fait par charite</span>;” — “The assistance which one gives in love.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(728)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme a la verite s’en est vne des prineipales</span>;” — “As in truth it is one of the chief’.” </p></div></div>
