<div class="comment-content"><p>It now follows, <em>As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, in the dwelling of the king who placed him on a throne, shall he die. </em>Although the Prophet had sufficiently shown that Zedekiah could not escape the penalty of his revolt, yet God here again comes forward, and swears by himself, or by his life, that he would punish Zedekiah. Hence the great stupidity of the people appears, for God never acts falsely by his own name, or brings it forward in vain, but when necessity demands it, he swears by himself. And by his own example he prescribes to us, that we should not rush rashly upon an oath, but be sober in this respect. But God swears <em>that Zedekiah should die on the spot, that is, at the capital of the king who put him on the throne</em>; that is Babylon, where he died: and yet he did not see Babylon, because his eyes were put out at Riblath, as we saw elsewhere. (<span class="bvs">Jer_39:7</span>; <span class="bvs">Jer_52:11</span>.) But the Prophet simply denounces the penalty, that he should die in exile, <em>and in the dwelling of the king who had placed him on his throne, and from whose covenant he had departed, and whose oath he had despised. </em></p></div>
