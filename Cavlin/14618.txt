<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>Though the waters thereof roar, </em>etc This verse ought to be read in connection with the verse which follows, because it is necessary to complete the sense, as if it had been said: Though the waters of the sea roar and swell, and by their fierce impetuosity shake the very mountains — even in the midst of these dreadful tumults, the holy city of God will continue to enjoy comfort and peace, satisfied with her small streams. The relative pronoun <em>her, </em>according to the common usage of the Hebrew language, is superfluous in this place. The prophet intended simply to say, that the small streams of a river would afford to the holy city abundant cause of rejoicing, though the whole world should be moved and destroyed. I have already mentioned shortly before how profitable is the doctrine taught us in this place, that our faith is really and truly tested only when we are brought into very severe conflicts, and when even hell itself seems opened to swallow us up. In like manner, we have portrayed to us the victory of faith over the whole world, when, in the midst of the utmost confusion, it unfolds itself, and begins to raise its head in such a manner as that although the whole creation seem to be banded together, and to have conspired for the destruction of the faithful, it nevertheless triumphs over all fear. Not that the children of God, when placed in peril, indulge in jesting or make a sport of death, but the help which God has promised them more than overbalances, in their estimation, all the evils which inspire them with fear. The sentiment of Horace is very beautiful, when, speaking of the righteous man and the man who feels conscious of no guilt, he says, (Car., Lib. iii., Od. 3,) </p><p>“Dux inquieti turbidus Adriae, <LineBreak />Nec fulminantis magna Jovis manus, <LineBreak />Si fractus illabitur orbis, <LineBreak />Impavidum ferient ruinae.” </p><p>“Let the wild winds that rule the seas, <LineBreak />Tempestuous, all their horrors raise; <LineBreak />Let Jove’s dread arm with thunders rend the spheres; <LineBreak />Beneath the crush of worlds undaunted he appears.” <span class="cite-ref">(176)</span></p><p>But as no such person as he imagines could ever be found, he only trifles in speaking as he does. Their fortitude, therefore, has its foundation in the assurance of the divine protection alone, so that they who rely upon God, and put their trust in him, may truly boast, not only that they shall be undismayed, but also that they shall be preserved in security and safety amidst the ruins of a falling world. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(176)</span> Francis’ Translation of Horace. </p></div></div>
