<div class="comment-content"><p>How, then, can it happen that we can be at rest while God is opposed to us? <em>Thou shalt say</em>, therefore, to those <em>who daub with untempered mortar, it shall fall</em>. Here the Spirit signifies that the false prophets should be subject to the greatest ridicule, when they shall be convicted by the event, and their is shall be proved by clear proof. Hence, also, we may gather the utility of the doctrine which Paul teaches, that we must stand bravely when God gives the reins to impostors to disturb or disperse the Church. They shall not proceed any further, says he. (<span class="bvs">2Ti_3:9</span>.) He says elsewhere in the same epistle, (<span class="bvs">2Ti_3:13</span>,) They shall wax worse and worse; that is, as far as God pleases to be patient with them. But meanwhile the end is at hand, when the Lord shall shame all the impious false prophets, and detect their ignorance, rashness, and audacity, because they dared to use his name in offering peace to the reprobate. <em>Thou shalt say, </em>therefore<em>, the wall shall fall</em>. He speaks here of doctrine. <em>There shall be an overflowing shower</em>, says he — a desolating rain. Here the Spirit signifies that there shall be a violent concussion which shall disperse all the artifices of the false prophets, and detect their frauds, when the Lord should bring on the Chaldaeans, and deliver the city to them. Hence the same meaning is intended <em>by the shower, by stones, by the rush of a whirlwind</em>, but it was necessary to express the same thing in many ways, because the Israelites had grown torpid through their fallacies, and willingly seized upon what the false prophets said — that God would be propitious to them. After he had mentioned the shower, he goes on to hailstones. The more probable reading is, Ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; unless perhaps it is better to take the verb <span class="lang he-il">תפלנה</span>, <em>thephelneh</em>, transitively, as I am inclined to do, <em>ye shall make fall. </em>This apostrophe is emphatic, because God addresses the stones themselves, and thereby obliquely reproves the sloth of those who thought to escape in safety through their blandishments. When God, therefore, addresses the stones, he doubtless reproaches the Israelites for hardening themselves so completely. He adds the violence of whirlwinds, or of tempests, in the same sense. <em>The violence of the whirlwinds</em>, then, shall <em>break down </em>or overthrow <em>the wall</em>. In conclusion, Ezekiel teaches that the doctrine of the false prophets had no need of any other refutation, that the arrival of the Chaldaeans, and their boasting, is like a storm and whirlwind to devastate the whole land: and thus he derides those praters who used their tongues so audaciously: he says that those strangers should come to refute these lies, not by words only, but by a violent attack. It follows — </p></div>
