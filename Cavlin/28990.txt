<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Would that ye did bear with me. </em>As he saw that the ears of the Corinthians were still in part pre-engaged, <span class="cite-ref">(793)</span> he has recourse to another contrivance, for he turns to express a wish, as persons do when they do not venture openly to entreat. <span class="cite-ref">(794)</span> Immediately afterwards, however, as if gathering confidence, he nevertheless entreats the Corinthians to bear with his<em>folly</em>. He gives the name of <em>folly </em>to that splendid proclamation of his praises, which afterwards follows. Not as if he were a fool in glorying; for he was constrained to it by necessity, and besides, he restrained himself in such a manner, that no one could justly regard him as going beyond bounds; but as it is an unseemly thing to herald one’s own praises, and a thing that is foreign to the inclinations of a modest man, he speaks by way of concession. </p><p>What I have rendered in the imperative — <em>bear with me, </em>Chrysostom interprets as an affirmation, and certainly the Greek word is ambiguous, and either sense suits sufficiently well. As, however, the reasons that the Apostle subjoins are designed to induce the Corinthians to <em>bear with him, </em>and as we will find him afterwards expostulating with them again on the ground of their not conceding anything to him, I have followed the Old Interpreter. <span class="cite-ref">(795)</span> By saying, <em>Would that, </em>etc., he had seemed to be distrustful; <em>now, </em>as if correcting that hesitation, he openly and freely commands. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(793)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Des propos des faux apostres</span>;” — “By the speeches of the false apostles.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(794)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceux ausquels ilsont affaire</span>;” — “Those with whom they have to do.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(795)</span> The rendering of the Vulgate is as follows: “Sed supportate me.” (“But bare with me.”) Wiclif (1380) reads: “But also supporte ye me.” Tyndale (1534) also renders in the imperative, as follows: “Yee, and I pray you forbeare me.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
