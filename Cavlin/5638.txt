<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>And thy carcase shall be meat</em>. The punishment is here doubled by the disgrace which is added to death; for it is ignominious to be deprived of burial, and justly reckoned amongst the curses of God; whilst it is a sign of His paternal favor that we should be distinguished from the brutes, inasmuch as the rites of burial arouse us to the hope of resurrection and everlasting life. Wherefore, on the contrary, God deprives of burial those whom He curses. But as we have said that punishments affecting the body are common to the pious and the reprobate, so also we must think of being deprived of sepulture, since it sometimes happens that the reprobate are honorably buried, as Christ relates of the luxurious Dives, (<span class="bvs">Luk_16:22</span>,) whilst the bodies of the pious are ignominiously cast a prey for birds and beasts; as the Prophet complains in <span class="bvs">Psa_79:2</span>. Still such an interchange does not prevent God from avenging the contempt of His Law by this mode of punishment, as by pestilence, famine, or sword. </p></div>
