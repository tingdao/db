<div class="comment-content"><p>The Psalmist expresses this still more clearly, by adding immediately after, (verses 30, 31,) that this pampering proved fatal to them, as if with the meat they had swallowed the flame of the divine wrath. When he says that <em>they were not estranged from their lust, </em>this implies, that they were still burning with their lust. If it is objected that this does not agree with the preceding sentence, where it is said, that “they did eat, and were thoroughly filled,” I would answer, that if, as is well known, the minds of men are not kept within the bounds of reason and temperance, they become insatiable; and, therefore, a great abundance will not extinguish the fire of a depraved appetite. Some translate the clause, <em>They were not disappointed, </em>and others, <em>They did not yet loathe their meat. </em>This last translation brings out the meaning very well; but it is too far removed from the signification of the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">זור</span>, <em>zur, </em>which I have rendered <em>estranged. </em>The prophet intended to express in two words a present felt pleasure; for when God executed vengeance upon the people, they still indulged in the excessive gratification of the palate. <span class="cite-ref">(335)</span><em>The wrath of God </em>is said metaphorically <em>to ascend, </em>when he suddenly rises up to execute judgment; for when he apparently shuts his eyes and takes no notice of our sins, he seems, so to speak, to be asleep. The punishment was felt by persons of every condition among the Israelites; but <em>the fat ones </em><span class="cite-ref">(336)</span> and <em>the chosen </em>are expressly named, in order to exhibit the judgment of God in a light still more conspicuous. It did not happen by chance that the most robust and vigorous were attacked and cut off by the plague. As the strong are commonly deceived by their strength, and proudly exalt themselves against God, forgetting their own weakness, and thinking that they may do whatever they please, it is not surprising to find that the wrath of God burned more fiercely against such persons than against others. </p><p><strong>(335)</strong> “<em>While their meat was yet in their mouth</em>; the meat of the quails, while it was between their teeth, ere it was chewed, and before it was swallowed down, while they were rolling this sweet morsel under their tongues, and were gorging themselves with it, destruction came upon them; just as Belshazzar, while he was feasting with his nobles, in the midst of his mirth and jollity, was slain by the Persians, <span class="bvs">Dan_5:1</span>.” —<em>Dr Gill</em>. </p><p><strong>(336)</strong> Mr Mudge observes, that this clause should be translated, “Slew them amidst their fatnesses or indulgences.” This is approved of by Lowth. Cocceius and Michaelis give a similar version. </p></div>
