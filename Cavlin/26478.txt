<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>And he worshipped him. </em>It may be asked, Did the blind man honor or worship Christ as God? <span class="cite-ref">(275)</span> The word which the Evangelist employs (<span class="lang el-gr">προσέκυνησει</span>) means nothing more than to express respect and homage by bending the knee, or by other signs. For my own part, certainly, I think that it denotes something rare and uncommon; namely, that the blind man gave far more honor to Christ than to an ordinary man, or even to a prophet. And yet I do not think that at that time he had made such progress as to know that Christ was God manifested in the flesh. What then is meant by <em>worship </em>? The blind man, convinced that Jesus was <em>the Son of God</em>, nearly lost the command of himself, and, in rapturous admiration, bowed down before him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(275)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si l’aveugle a honore ou adore Christ comme Dieu</span>.” </p></div></div>
