<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>They pour forth, they speak hard things </em><span class="cite-ref">(15)</span> He shows in still clearer terms, how their fierceness in persecution was such that they did not scruple to glory in their guilt. The Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">נבע</span>, <em>nabang, </em>means more than <em>to speak. </em>Literally it signifies <em>to rush </em>or <em>boil forth, </em>and comes to denote figuratively the uttering of reckless or rash words. We see how wicked men are instigated by pride and vain-glory, to demean and disgrace themselves so far as to boast vain-gloriously of their power, breathing forth threatenings of bloodshed, violence, and monstrous cruelty. It is to such ebullitions that the Psalmist refers, when men who are lost to all sense of shame and modesty boast of the wickedness which they can perpetrate at will. This is what he means by their <em>speaking hard things, </em>uttering discourse which is under no restraint of fear, or prudential consideration, but which launches into the most unbridled license. As the Lord’s people had formerly to endure the heavy trial of seeing the Church subjected to this wild tyranny and misrule, we should account it no strange thing to see the Church suffering still under miserable misgovernment, or positive oppression, but should pray for help from God, who, though he connives at wickedness for a time, eventually comes to the deliverance of his children. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(15)</span> In our English Bible this verse is put into the interrogative form, and the words “how long” are supplied: “<em>How long </em>shall they utter <em>and </em>speak hard things?” Calvin translates it as a simple statement, and without any supplemental words; which Archbishop Secker considers to be more correct. </p></div></div>
