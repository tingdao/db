<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25</strong><em>And having this confidence</em>. Some, reckoning it an inconsistent thing that the Apostle <span class="cite-ref">(82)</span> should acknowledge himself to have been disappointed of his expectation, are of opinion that he was afterwards freed from bonds, and went over many countries of the world. Their fears, however, as to this are groundless, for the saints are accustomed to regulate their expectations according to the word of God, so as not to promise themselves more than God has promised. Thus, when they have a sure token of God’s will, they in that case place their reliance also upon a sure persuasion, which admits of no hesitation. Of this nature is a persuasion respecting a perpetual remission of sins, respecting the aid of the Spirit for the grace of final perseverance, (as it is called,) and respecting the resurrection of the flesh. Of this nature, also, was the assurance of the Prophets respecting their prophecies. As to other things, they expect nothing except conditionally, and hence they subject all events to the providence of God, who, they allow, sees more distinctly than they. To <em>remain</em>, means here, to stay for a little while: to <em>continue</em>, means, to remain for a long time. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(82)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vn tel sainct Apostre</span>;” — “So holy an Apostle.” </p></div></div>
