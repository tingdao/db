<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>But malice shall slay the wicked. </em>The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">רעה</span>,<em>raäh, </em>which I have translated <em>malice, </em>some would rather render <em>misery, </em>so that the meaning would be, that the ungodly shall perish miserably, because in the end they shall be overwhelmed with calamities. The other translation, however, is more expressive, namely, that their wickedness, with which they think themselves fortified, shall fall upon their own heads. As David therefore taught before, that there was no defense better than a just and blameless life, so now he declares, that all the wicked enterprises of the wicked, even though no one should in any thing oppose them, shall turn to their own destruction. In the second clause of the verse he states, that it is for the sake of the righteous that it is ordered, that the ungodly are themselves the cause and instruments of their own destruction. <em>Those, </em>says he, <em>who hate the righteous shall be destroyed </em>Let this, therefore, be to us as a wall of brass and sure defense; that however numerous the enemies which beset us may be, we should not be afraid, because they are already devoted to destruction. The same thing David confirms in the last verse, in which he says, that <em>Jehovah redeems the soul of his servants </em>How could they be preserved in safety, even for a moment, among so many dangers, unless God interposed his power for their defense? But by the word <em>redeem </em>there is expressed a kind of preservation which is repugnant to the flesh. For it is necessary that we should first be adjudged or doomed to death, before God should appear as our redeemer. From this it follows, that those who hurry forward too precipitately, and are unable to realize God’s power unless he appear speedily, working deliverance for them, intercept the communication of his grace. Moreover, that none might form their judgment of the servants of God by moral or philosophic virtue only, as it is called, David specifies this as a principal mark by which they may be known, that they trust in God, on whom also their salvation depends. </p></div>
