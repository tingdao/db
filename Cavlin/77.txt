<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Unto Adam also, and to his wife, did the Lord God make, etc</em>. Moses here, in a homely style, declares that the Lord had undertaken the labor of making garments of skins for Adam and his wife. It is not indeed proper so to understand his words, as if God had been a furrier, or a servant to sew clothes. Now, it is not credible that skins should have been presented to them by chance; but, since animals had before been destined for their use, being now impelled by a new necessity, they put some to death, in order to cover themselves with their skins, having been divinely directed to adopt this counsel; therefore Moses calls God the Author of it. The reason why the Lord clothed them with garments of skin appears to me to be this: because garments formed of this material would have a more degrading appearance than those made of linen or of woolen. <span class="cite-ref">(212)</span> God therefore designed that our first parents should, in such a dress, behold their own vileness, — just as they had before seen it in their nudity, — and should thus be reminded of their sin. <span class="cite-ref">(213)</span> In the meantime, it is not to be denied, that he would propose to us an example, by which he would accustom us to a frugal and inexpensive mode of dress. And I wish those delicate persons would reflect on this, who deem no ornament sufficiently attractive, unless it exceed in magnificence. Not that every kind of ornament is to be expressly condemned; but because when immoderate elegance and splendor is carefully sought after, not only is that Master despised, who intended clothing to be a sign of shame, but war is, in a certain sense, carried on against nature. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(212)</span> “Quia [vestes] ex ea materia confectae, belluinum quiddam magis saperent, quam linae vel laneae.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(213)</span> “As the prisoner, looking on his irons, thinketh on his theft, so we, looking on our garments, should think on our sins.” — <em>Trapp</em>. </p><p>For an ample discussion of the reasons why a more comprehensive view should be taken of this subject than Calvin here adopts, the reader may turn to Dr. Magee’s learned “Discourses and Dissertations on the Scriptural Doctrines of Atonement and Sacrifice;” where he will see, that the origin of the clothing with skins was most probably connected with a previous appointment of the sacrifice of animals. — See <em>Magee</em>, note 52:— <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
