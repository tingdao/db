<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>When he did knock at the gate. </em>Whereas they think that the maid is mad, which telleth them that Peter was come; we gather by this, that they did not hope or look for Peter’s deliverance, and yet we will not say that they prayed without faith; because they looked for some other success, to with that Peter being armed with power from heaven, should be ready, whether it were by life or death, to glorify God, <span class="cite-ref">(759)</span> that the flock being terrified with the violent invasion of wolves might not be scattered abroad, that those that were weak might not faint, that the Lord would put away that whirlwind of persecution. But in that the Lord granteth them more than they hoped for, he surpasseth their desires with his infinite goodness. And now that which was done seemeth to them incredible, that they may be the more provoked to praise his power. </p><p><em>It is his angel. </em>They call him his angel, who was by God appointed to be his keeper and the minister of his safety. In which sense Christ saith that the angels of little ones do always see the face of his Father, (<span class="bvs">Mat_18:10</span>.) And what do they gather hence commonly? that every particular man hath a particular angel, which taketh charge of him; but it is too weak. For the Scripture doth sometimes testify (<span class="bvs">Exo_14:10</span>) that there is one angel given to a great people, and to one man only a great host. For Elizeus [Elisha] his servant had his eyes opened, so that he saw in the air chariots of fire, which were appointed to defend the prophet, (<span class="bvs">2Kg_6:17</span>.) And in Daniel there is but one angel of the Persians, and one of the Grecians named, (<span class="bvs">Dan_10:5</span>.) Neither doth the Scripture promise to every man a certain and peculiar angel, but rather that the Lord hath charged his angels to keep all the faithful, (<span class="bvs">Psa_91:11</span>;) also that they pitch their tents about the godly, (<span class="bvs">Psa_34:8</span>.) Therefore, that vain surmise which is common touching the two angels of every man is profane. Let this be sufficient for us, that the whole host of heaven doth watch for the safety of the Church; and that as necessity of time requireth sometimes one angel, sometimes more do defend us with their aid. Assuredly, this is inestimable goodness of God, in that he saith that the angels, who are the beams of his brightness, are our ministers. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(759)</span> “Christi nomen,” the name of Christ. </p></div></div>
