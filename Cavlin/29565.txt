Paul, as I have said before, has it as his aim, that the Thessalonians, influenced by the same considerations, may entertain no doubt that they were elected by God. For it had been the design of God, in honoring Paul’s ministry, that he might manifest to them their adoption. Accordingly, having said that they <em>know what manner of persons they had been</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(504)</span> he immediately adds that he was such<em>for their sake</em>, by which he means that all this had been given them, in order that they might be fully persuaded that they were loved by God, and that their election was beyond all controversy. </p><p><strong>(504)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quels auoyent este St. Paul et ses compagnons</span>;” — “What manner of persons St. Paul and his associates had been.” </p></div>
