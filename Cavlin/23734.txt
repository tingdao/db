<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_18:6</span><strong>.</strong><em>But whosoever shall offend one of those little ones. </em>This appears to be added for the consolation of the godly, that they may not be rendered uneasy by their condition, if they are despised by the world. It is a powerful obstruction to the voluntary exercise of modesty, when they imagine, that by so doing they expose themselves to contempt; and it is hard to be not only treated disdainfully, but almost trodden under foot, by haughty men. Christ therefore encourages his disciples by the consoling truth, that, if their mean condition draws upon them the insults of the world, God does not despise them. </p><p>But he appears to have had likewise another object in view; for a dispute had arisen amongst them as to the first place of honor, from which it might naturally have been inferred that the Apostles were tainted with sinful ambition. Every man who thinks too highly of himself, or desires to be preferred to others, must necessarily treat his brethren with disdain. To cure this disease, Christ threatens a dreadful punishment, if any man in his pride shall throw down those who are oppressed with poverty, or who in heart are already humbled. </p><p>Under the word <em>offend </em>he includes more than if he had forbidden them to <em>despise </em>their brethren; though the man who gives himself no concern about <em>offending </em>the weak, does so for no other reason, than because he does not render to them the honor to which they are entitled. Now as there are various kinds of <em>offenses</em>, it will be proper to explain generally what is meant by <em>offending </em>If any man through our fault either stumbles, or is drawn aside from the right course, or retarded in it, we are said to <em>offend </em>him. <span class="cite-ref">(504)</span> Whoever then desires to escape that fearful punishment which Christ denounces, let him stretch out his hand to the <em>little ones </em>who are despised by the world, and let him kindly assist them in keeping the path of duty; for Christ recommends them to our notice, that they may lead us to exercise voluntary humility; as Paul enjoins the children of God to </p><p>condescend to men of low estate, (<span class="bvs">Rom_12:16</span>,) </p><p>and again says that </p><p>we ought not to please ourselves, (<span class="bvs">Rom_15:1</span>.) </p><p>To <em>hang a millstone about a </em>man’s <em>neck, and drown him in the sea</em>, was the punishment then reckoned the most appalling, and which was inflicted on the most atrocious malefactors. When our Lord alludes to this punishment, we are enabled to perceive how dear and precious those persons are in the sight of God, who are mean and despised in the eyes of the world. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(504)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">L’Escriture dit que nous oftensons ou scandalizons cestuy la</span>.” — “Scripture says that we give <em>offense </em>or <em>scandal </em>to that man.” </p></div></div>
