<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>But you have a custom. </em>Pilate was all along pondering in what way he might save Christâ€™s life; but, the people being so fiercely enraged, he attempted to keep a middle path, in order to allay their fury; for he thought that it would be enough if Christ, being dismissed <em>as a malefactor, </em>were marked with perpetual ignominy, lie therefore selects <em>Barabbas </em>above all others, in order that, by a comparison with that man, the hatred which they bore to Christ might be softened down; for Barabbas was universally and strongly detested on account of his atrocious crimes. And, indeed, is there any thing more detestable than <em>a robber? </em>But Luke (<span class="bvs">Luk_23:19</span>) relates that, in addition to this, he was guilty of other crimes. </p><p>That the Jews preferred him to Christ, did not happen without a singular interposition of the providence of God; for it would have been highly unbecoming, that the Son of God should be rescued from death by so dishonorable a price. Yeb by his death, he was thrown into the deepest ignominy, so that, in consequence of the release of <em>Barabbas, </em>he was crucified between two robbers; for he had taken upon himself the sins of all, which could not be expiated in any other way; and the glory of his resurrection, by which it was speedily followed, caused his death itself to be a splendid triumph. </p><p>This <em>custom, </em>by which the Roman governor delivered up to the Jews, every year, at the passover, some criminal, involved a base and heinous crime. It was done, no doubt in order to honor the sacredness of the day, but was, in reality, nothing else than a shameful profanation of it; for Scripture declares, that </p><p>he who acquitteth the guilty is abomination in the sight of God, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Pro_17:15</span>;) </p><p>and therefore he is far from taking delight in that improper kind of forgiveness. Let us learn by this example, that nothing is more ridiculous, than to attempt to serve God by our inventions; for, as soon as men begin to follow their own imaginations, there will be no end till, by falling into some of the most absurd fooleries, they openly insult God. The rule for the worship of God, therefore, ought to be taken from nothing else than from his own appointment. </p></div>
