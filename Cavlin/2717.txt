<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And thou shalt take the anointing oil </em>There was by no means any virtue or efficacy for sanctification in the oil, except in so far as it was a type of the Spirit, from whom as its only source all holiness emanates. Assuredly the oil, as being a corruptible fluid, neither penetrates into the soul, nor would by itself at all avail unto spiritual service. It appears, however, from many pnssages of Scripture, that it was a symbol of all the gifts of the Holy Spirit. This figure, therefore, clearly shews that nothing pleases God, that nothing is pure or holy in His sight, except what has been purged, and duly consecrated by the influence and grace of the Holy Spirit. Moreover, God would have all the vessels of the sanctuary set apart by this sacred anointing from common use, in order that the Israelites might distinguish between things sacred and profane, and thus that God’s service might receive its due reverence, so that none should intrude the pollutions of the flesh into that place, the purity of which had been signalized by that sacred symbol. A question, however, here arises why he dignifies the altar of burnt-offering with a more exalted title; for, after having called the tabernacle itself with its vessels simply <em>holy, </em>He calls the altar “holy of holies,” which I have rendered <em>sacrosanctum. </em>I doubt not but that it acquired this name from the sacrifices, which are also so called on account of the expiation made by them, <span class="cite-ref">(397)</span> as we have seen elsewhere. The children of Israel, therefore, were instructed that God is truly reconciled by holocausts and burnt-offerings, since “the holiness of holinesses” resided on the altar itself. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(397)</span> See on <span class="bvs">Lev_6:25</span>, <em>ante, </em>vol. 2, p. 366. </p></div></div>
