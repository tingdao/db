<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Have I been so long time with you? </em>Christ justly reproves Philip for not having the eyes of his faith pure. He had God present in Christ, and yet he did not behold him. What prevented him but his own ingratitude? Thus, in the present day, they who, in consequence of not being satisfied with Christ alone, are hurried into foolish speculations, in order to seek God in them, make little progress in the Gospel. This foolish desire springs from the meanness of Christâ€™s low condition; and this is very unreasonable, for by that humiliation he exhibits the infinite goodness of God. </p></div>
