<div class="comment-content"><p>I come now to the kind of fraud they practiced, <em>If there be, he says, in his flock a male, that is, a lamb or a ram, when he vows, then what is corrupt he offers to Jehovah</em>. He then means, that though they pretended some religion, yet nothing was done by them with a sincere and honest heart; for they immediately repented of the vow made to God; they thought that they might be reduced to poverty, if they were too bountiful in their sacrifices. Hence then the Prophet proves that they offered to God with a double mind, and that whatever they thus offered was polluted, because it did not proceed from a right motive. </p><p>We said yesterday, that the Prophet did not require fat or lean beasts, because God valued either the blood or flesh of animals on its own account, but for the end in view; for these were the performances of religion by which God designed to train up the Jews for the end contemplated, and in the duty of repentance. As then they were so sordid as to these sacrifices, it was easy to conclude, that they were gross and profane despisers of God, and had no concern for religion. </p><p>The reason follows, <em>For a great king am I, saith Jehovah, and my name is terrible </em><span class="cite-ref">(212)</span><em>among the nations</em>. God declares here that his majesty was of no account among the Jews, as though he had said, “With whom do you think that you have to do?” And this is what we ought carefully to consider when engaged in God’s service. We indeed know that it is a vice which has prevailed in all ages, that all nations and individuals thought that they worshipped God, when they devised foolish and frivolous rites according to their own fancies. If then we have a desire to worship God aright, we must remember how great he is; for his majesty will raise us up above the whole world, and cease will that audacity which possesses almost all mankind; for they think that their own will is a law, when they presumptuously obtrude anything on God. The greatness of God then ought to humble us, that we may not worship him according to the perceptions of our flesh, but offer him only what is worthy of his celestial glory. </p><p>He again repeats what we have before observed, though it was disregarded by the Jews, — that he was a <em>great king </em>through the whole world. As then the Jews thought that sacrifices could not be offered to God, such as he would accept, in any other place but at Jerusalem, and in the temple on Mount Sion, he testifies that he is a great king even in the farthest parts of the world. It hence follows, that God’s worship would not be confined to Judea, or to any other particular part of the world; for by the gospel the Lord would receive to himself all nations, and come into the possession of his kingdom. Now follows </p><p><strong>(212)</strong> Rendered “illustrious — <span class="lang el-gr">επιφανὲς</span>,” by the <em>Septuagint</em>, — “powerful,” by the <em>Targum</em>, — “dreadful — horrible,” by <em>Jerome</em>, — “terrible — terrible,” by <em>Marckius</em>, — “shall be feared,” by <em>Henderson</em>, — “shall be had in reverence,” by <em>Newcome</em>, and the same with <em>Drusius</em>, “reverendum.” The word is literally “to be feared,” <span class="lang he-il">נורא</span>; it is often rendered “terrible,” what causes dread or terror. Some take the present tense, “my name is terrible,” <em>i.e.</em>, is dreaded on account of my greatness, manifested by my judgments. But if we take the future, then we must render the words — “my name shall be feared” or reverenced. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
