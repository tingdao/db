<div class="comment-content"><p>He says that the <em>covenant </em>which he will make will not be such as he <em>had made with </em>their <em>fathers </em>Here he clearly distinguishes the new covenant from the Law. The contrast ought to be borne in mind; for no one of the Jews thought it possible that God would add anything better to the Law. For though they regarded the Law almost as nothing, yet we know that hypocrites pretended with great ardor of zeal that they were so devoted to the Law, that they thought that heaven and earth could sooner be blended together, than that any change should be made in the Law; and at the same time they held most tenaciously what God had only for a time instituted. It was therefore necessary that the Law should be here contrasted with the new covenant, that the Jews might know that the favor in reserve for them would be far more excellent than what had been formerly manifested to the fathers. This, then, is the reason why he says, not according to the <em>covenant, </em>etc. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>which I made with their fathers when I laid hold of their hand, etc. </em>Here he shows that they could never have a firm hope of salvation, unless God made a new covenant. Such was their pride, that they hardly would have received the favor of God, had they not been convinced of this truth: for this would have been always in their mouth, “Did not God shew himself a Father to his people when he redeemed them? was it not a testimony of his paternal favor? has he not elevated the condition of the Church, which he designs to be perpetual?” They would have therefore rejected the favor of God, had not the Prophet openly declared that the Law had been and would be still useless to them, and that there was therefore a necessity for a new covenant, otherwise they must have perished. </p><p>We now perceive the design of the Prophet; and this ought to be carefully observed; for it would not be enough to know what the Prophet says, except we also know why he says this or that. The meaning then is, that it ought not to appear strange that God makes a new covenant, because the first had been useless and was of no avail. Then he confirms this, because God made the first covenant when he stretched out his hand to his ancient people, and became their liberator; and yet they <em>made void </em>that covenant. The circumstance as to the time ought to be noticed, for the memory of a recent benefit ought to be a most powerful motive to obedience. For how base an ingratitude it was for those, who had been delivered by the wonderful power of God, to reject his covenant at a time when they had been anticipated by divine mercy? As then they had made void even at that time the covenant of God, it may with certainty be concluded, that there had been no time in which they had not manifested their impiety, and had not been covenant-breakers. </p><p>He adds, <em>I however ruled over them, </em>or was Lord over them. Though some confine the verb <span class="lang he-il">בעלתי</span><em>bolti, </em>to the rule exercised by a husband, and this would not be unsuitable, as God not only ruled then over his people, but was also their husband, a similitude which is often used; yet I know not whether this view can be satisfactorily sustained we ought therefore to be satisfied with the general truth, that God had the people under his own authority, as though he had said, that he only used his own right in ruling over them and prescribing to them the way in which they were to live. At the same time the word covenant, was more honorable to the people. For when a king enjoins anything on his people, it is called an edict; but God deals with his own people more kindly, for he descends and appears in the midst of them, that he may bind himself to his people, as he binds the people to himself. We hence see, in short, why God says that he <em>ruled over </em>the people, even because he had purchased them for himself, and yet he had not enjoyed his own right on account of the untameable and perverse disposition of the people. <span class="cite-ref">(53)</span></p><p>It ought at the same time to be observed, that the fault is here cast on the people, that the Law was weak and not sufficiently valid, as we see that Paul teaches us in <span class="bvs">Rom_7:12</span>. For as soon as the weakness of the Law is spoken of, the greater part lay hold of something they deem wrong in the Law, and thus the Law is rendered contemptible: hence the Prophet says here that <em>they </em>had made God’s <em>covenant void, </em>as though he had said, that the fault was not to be sought in the Law that there was need of a new covenant, for the Law was abundantly sufficient, but that the fault was in the levity and the unfaithfulness of the people. We now then see that nothing is detracted from the Law when it is said to be weak and ineffectual; for it is an accidental fault derived from men who do not observe nor keep their pledged faith. There are still more things to be said; but I now, as I have said, touch but briefly on the words of the Prophet. It then follows, — </p><p><strong>(53)</strong> This clause, as quoted in <span class="bvs">Heb_8:9</span>, is, “And I regarded them not,” according to the <em>Sept. </em>and the <em>Syr., </em>though the <em>Vulg. </em>is the same with our version. <em>Houbigant </em>says, “Read <span class="lang he-il">געלתי</span> I have rejected, I have repudiated.” The only difference is in one letter; and this word is used by Jeremiah in <span class="bvs">Jer_14:19</span>. There would thus be a perfect correspondence, “and I rejected them, saith Jehovah.” </p><p>“Which my covenant,” in the previous clause, is the <em>Vulg.; </em>but according to the <em>Sept., </em>the <em>Syr., </em>and the <em>Targ., </em>it is, “because they have broken my covenant,” etc. <span class="lang he-il">אשר</span> is not used, as given in our version, in connection with a noun that follows, though it is so used with pronouns. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
