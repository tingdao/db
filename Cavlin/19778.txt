<div class="comment-content"><p>But before God promised anything respecting the return of the people, he strengthened the mind of the Prophet by a preface, and also encouraged and animated the godly to entertain good hope. The preface is, that God created and <em>formed Jerusalem </em>There was, then, no doubt but he would at length rescue it from the hands of enemies; nay, that he would raise it up even from hell itself. To prove this, he says that he is <em>Jehovah </em>We hence see why the Prophet, before he recited the promise, honored God with magnificent titles. But it is doubtful whether the past or the present time is to be understood, when it is said, <em>Jehovah the maker of it, Jehovah the former of it; </em>for either would be suitable, — that is, that God at the beginning built Jerusalem and was its founder, or that he had purposed again to create and form it anew. If the past time be taken, then the meaning is, that the city, which had been built by God, could not possibly perish, because his will was that it should remain perpetually. And the same sentiment often occurs in the Prophets, and also in the Psalms. For it was God’s design to be regarded as the founder of Jerusalem, in order that he might distinguish it from all other cities of the world. We know that there is nothing under the sun perpetual, for the whole world is subject to various changes; nay, </p><p>“the fashion of this world,” as Paul says, “passeth away.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_7:31</span>) </p><p>As, then, changes so various take place in all cities, God, by a singular privilege, exempted Jerusalem from this common lot; and hence the Prophet truly and wisely concludes, that the ruin of the city would not be perpetual, because God had formed it. And hence its future restitution is sufficiently proved. </p><p>But if any one prefers the present time, then the meaning would be, that he who had resolved to create and form Jerusalem is <em>Jehovah, </em>the God of hosts: no one then can hinder his work. As this sense is not unsuitable, I do not reject it, though I follow the former. We must, at the same time, bear in mind this principle, — that restoration is promised to the Jews, because Jerusalem had been, as it were, chosen by God, so that he took it under his care and protection, so as to preserve it perpetually. Whether then we take the words to be in the past or present time, that God is the creator and former of Jerusalem, we see that the promise of deliverance is founded on the mercy of God, even because he had cliosen Jerusalem for his own habitation, according to what is in the Psalms, </p><p>“His foundations are on the holy mountains.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_87:1</span>) </p><p>And there, also, the pronoun is used instead of God’s name, as here instead of the city’s name, <em>Thus saith Jehovah, who has created it, who has formed it, that he might establish it </em>Here Jerusalem is not named; but the narrative is much more emphatical than if it was expressed, as also in the place we have just quoted, the word God is not given, nor the word Church, if I mistake not, in the 37<span class="cite-ref">th</span> chapter of Isaiah (<span class="bvs">Isa_37:0</span>). When the Prophet says, </p><p>“His foundations are on the holy mountains,” </p><p>there is no doubt but that the word God is to be understood, though not expressed. So here, when speaking of the city, he says that Jehovah <em>formed it, </em>or will form it. <span class="cite-ref">(86)</span></p><p>He adds, <em>Jehovah is his name </em>Here he exalts the power of God, that the Jews might not set up against him what otherwise might have terrified them, and, as it were, reduced them to a lifeless state, and caused them wholly to faint away. He, therefore, sets before their eyes the power of God, as though he had said, that there would be no obstacle which could delay God’s work, for he had resolved to form and create anew his own city after its demolition; it is, in a word, the same as though he had bidden the people to turn their eyes and all their thoughts to God, to consider his immeasurable power, and so to entertain hope, and thus to look down, as it were, from on high on all the impediments which might have otherwise wholly weakened their confidence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(86)</span> The <em>Sept. </em>give the present time, “who makes,” etc.; the <em>Vulg. </em>the future, “who will make,” etc.; and the <em>Syr. </em>and the <em>Targ. </em>in the past, “who made,” etc. The verse may be thus rendered, — </p><p>Thus saith Jehovah, — Made it hath Jehovah, Having formed it in order to establish it; Jehovah <em>is </em>his name. </p><p>That the city is meant cannot be disputed, as the word itself is introduced in the 4<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse (<span class="bvs">Jer_33:4</span>), and at the end of the 5<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse. In the <em>Sept. </em>it is land, “who makes the land,” and in the <em>Syr., </em>“who made thee:” both which are no doubt wrong. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
