<div class="comment-content"><p>God declares here to the false teachers by the mouth of Micah, that he would inflict punishment on them, so that they should be exposed to the reproach of all. Hence the kind of punishment of which the Prophet speaks is — that he would strip the false teachers of all their dignity, so that they should hereafter in vain put on an appearance, and claim the honorable name which they had so long abused. We indeed know, when ungodly and profane men clothe themselves with the dignified titles of being the princes, or bishops, or prelates of the Church, how audaciously they pervert every thing, and do so with impunity. There is then no other remedy, except God pulls off the mask from them, and openly discovers to all their baseness. Of this punishment Micah now speaks. </p><p><em>There shall be to you a night from vision; </em>so is the phrase literally, but the particle <span class="lang he-il">מ</span>, <em>mem, </em>means often, for, or, on account of; and we can easily see that the Prophet represents night as the reward for visions and darkness for divination. “As then my people have been deceived by your fallacies, for your visions and divinations have been nothing but lies and deceits, I will repay you with the reward which you have deserved: for instead of a vision you shall have night, and instead of divination you shall have thick darkness.” <span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> It is indeed certain, that the false teachers, even when they were, as they say, in great reputation, that is, when they retained the honor and the title of their office, were blind and wholly destitute of all light: but the Prophet here declares, that as their baseness did not appear to the common people, God would cause it to be made at length fully evident. As for instance, there is nothing at this day more stupid and senseless than the bishops of the Papacy: for when any one draws from them any expression about religion, they instantly betray not only their ignorance, but also their shameful stupidity. With regard to the monks, though they be the most audacious kind of animals, (<em>audacissimum animalium genus,</em>) yet we know how unlearned and ignorant they are. Therefore at this time the night has not yet passed away, nor the darkness, of which Micah speaks here. </p><p>We now then understand what the Holy Spirit teaches here, and that is, — that God would at length strip those false teachers of that imaginary dignity, on account of which no one dared to speak against them, but received as an oracle whatever they uttered. <em>Night, </em>then,<em>shall be to you instead of a vision; </em>that is, “The whole world shall understand that you are not what you boast yourselves to be: for I will show that there is not in you, no, not a particle of the prophetic spirit, but that ye are men as dark as night, and darkness shall be to you instead of divination. Ye boast of great acuteness and great perspicuity of mind; but I will discover your baseness, so that the very children may know that you are not endued with the spirit.” </p><p>To the same purpose is what he adds, <em>Go down shall the sun upon you, and darkened over you shall be the day; </em>that is, such will be that darkness, that even at noon they will see nothing; the sun will shine on all, but they shall grope as in the dark; so that Gods vengeance would be made so manifest, that it might be noticed by all, from the least to the greatest. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span> That this is the meaning is evident from the two last lines of the verse. It is a kind of parallelism, in which the four lines contain the same idea or ideas, announced in the two first lines in one form, and in the two last another, with more clearness, and sometimes with something additional. The preposition <span class="lang he-il">מ</span> has sometimes the meaning of <em>rather than, </em>but here, <em>instead of. </em>I would render the verse thus, — </p><p>Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision, <LineBreak />And darkness shall be to you instead of divination: <LineBreak />Yea, set shall the sun upon the Prophets, <LineBreak />And darken upon them shall the day. </p><p><em>Piscator </em>gives the sense when he says, <em>Visio vestra mutabitur in noctem </em> — “Your vision shall be changed into night.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
