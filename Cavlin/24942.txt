<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>48.</strong><em>Because he hath looked </em>She explains the reason why the joy of her heart was founded in God to be, that out of free grace he had looked upon her. By calling herself <em>low </em>she disclaims all merit, and ascribes to the undeserved goodness of God every occasion of boasting. For <span class="lang el-gr">ταπείνωσις</span>, <em>lowness, </em>does not here denote — as ignorant and uneducated men have foolishly imagined — “submission, or modesty, or a quality of the mind,” but signifies <em>“ </em>a mean and despicable condition.” <span class="cite-ref">(48)</span> The meaning is, <em>“ </em>I was unknown and despised, but that did not prevent God from deigning to cast his eyes upon me.” But if Mary’s <em>lowness </em>is contrasted with excellence — as the matter itself and the Greek word make abundantly plain — we see how Mary makes herself nothing, and praises God alone. And this was not the loud cry of a pretended humility, but the plain and honest statement of that conviction which was engraven on her mind; for she was of no account in the eyes of the world, and her estimation of herself was nothing more. </p><p><em>From this time </em>She announces that this kindness of God will be kept in remembrance throughout <em>all generations </em>But if it is so remarkable, that it ought to be proclaimed every where by the lips of all men, silence regarding it would have been highly improper in Mary, on whom it was bestowed. Now observe, that Mary makes her happiness to consist in nothing else, but in what she acknowledges to have been bestowed upon her by <em>God, </em>and mentions as the gift of his grace. <em>“ </em>I shall be reckoned blessed,” she says, <em>“ </em>through all ages.” Was it because she sought this praise by her own power or exertion? On the contrary, she makes mention of nothing but of the work of God. Hence we see how widely the Papists differ from her, who idly adorn her with their empty devices, and reckon almost as nothing the benefits which she received from God. <span class="cite-ref">(49)</span> They heap up an abundance of magnificent and very presumptuous titles, such as, <em>“ </em>Queen of Heaven, Star of Salvation, Gate of Life, Sweetness, Hope, and Salvation.” Nay more, to such a pitch of insolence and fury have they been hurried by Satan, that they give her authority over Christ; <span class="cite-ref">(50)</span> for this is their pretty song, <em>“ </em>Beseech the Father, Order the Son.” <span class="cite-ref">(51)</span> None of these modes of expression, it is evident, proceeded from the Lord. All are disclaimed by the holy virgin in a single word, when she makes her whole glory to consist in acts of the divine kindness. If it was her duty to praise the name of God alone, who <em>had done to her wonderful things, </em>no room is left for the pretended titles, which come from another quarter. Besides, nothing could be more disrespectful to her, than to rob the Son of God of what is his own, to clothe her with the sacrilegious plunder. </p><p>Let Papists now go, and hold us out as doing injury to the mother of Christ, because we reject the falsehoods of men, and extol in her nothing more than the kindness of God. Nay, what is most of all honorable to her we grant, and those absurd worshippers refuse. <span class="cite-ref">(52)</span> We cheerfully acknowledge her as our teacher, and obey her instruction and commands. There certainly is no obscurity in what she says here; but the Papists throw it aside, trample it as it were under foot, and do all they can to destroy the credit of her statements? <span class="cite-ref">(53)</span> Let us remember that, in praising both men and angels, there is a general rule laid down, to extol in them the grace of God; as nothing is at all worthy of praise which did not proceed from Him. </p><p><em>He who is mighty hath done to me wonderful things </em>She informs us, that the reason why God did not in this case employ the assistance of others was, to make his own power more illustrious. And here we must recall what she formerly said, that God <em>had looked upon her, </em>though she was mean and despicable. Hence it follows, that those praises of Mary are absurd and spurious which do not altogether exalt the power and free grace of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(48)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les Latins, traduisans ce passage du Grec, ont us, du mot d'Humi- lite, lequel les barbares et sots parleurs de Latin, prennent ici comme en Francois, pour une facon de faire contraire a l'arrogance, assavoir quand une personne s'estime rien: mais il se prend autrement, assavoir pour Petitesse; c'est a dire, condition basse et meprisee</span>.” — “The Latins, translating this passage from the Greek, have used the word Humility, which barbarians and fools talking Latin take here, as in French, for a manner of acting opposed to pride: but it is taken differently, namely, for Meanness, that is, a low and despicable condition.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(49)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En cela nous voyons coment les Papistes accordent mal avec elle, lesquels sans jugement la parent de nouvelles louanges forgees en leurs cerveaux; et cependant ne tiennent quasi conte do tous les biens que’lle a eus de Dieu</span>.” — “In this we see how ill the Papists agree with her, who without judgment adorn her with new praises forged in their own brains; and yet make no account, as it were, of all the benefits which she had from God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(50)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui plus est, Satan les a transportez en une telle rage et forcenerie, qui’ls n’ont point eu de honte du luy attributer l’authorite de commander a Christ</span>.” — “What is more, Satan has carried them away to such a rage and fury, that they are not ashamed to attribute to her authority to command Christ.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(51)</span> “Roga Patrem, jube Natum.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(52)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En ce faisant, nous luy accordons ce qui luy est le plus honorable, en lieu que ces habiles gens, qui la servent a contrepoil, l’en despouillent</span>.” — “In doing this we grant to her what is the most honorable, while those clever people, who serve her the wrong way, take it from her.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(53)</span> “Fidem ejus dictis abrogant;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">dementent la vierge en tant qu'en eux est</span>;” — “as far as lies in them, they make the virgin a liar.” </p></div></div>
