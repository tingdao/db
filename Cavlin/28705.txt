<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>If any one speak in another tongue </em>He now describes the order and limits the measure. <em>“If </em>you have a mind to speak with other tongues,<em>let only two speak, or, at most, not more than three, and let there be at the same time an interpreter sitting by </em>Without an interpreter, <em>tongues </em>are of no advantage: let them, therefore be dispensed with.” It is to be observed, however, that he does not <em>command, </em>but merely <em>permits; </em>for the Church can, without any inconvenience, dispense with <em>tongues, </em>except in so far as they are helps to prophecy, as the Hebrew and Greek languages are at this day. Paul, however, makes this concession, that he may not seem to deprive the assembly of believers of any gift of the Spirit. </p><p>At the same time, it might seem as if even this were not agreeable to reason, inasmuch as he said before, (<span class="bvs">1Co_14:22</span>,) that <em>tongues, </em>in so far as they are for a <em>sign, </em>are suited to <em>unbelievers. </em>I answer, that, while a miracle may be performed more particularly with a view to unbelievers, it, nevertheless, does not follow, that it may not be of some advantage to believers also. If you understand, that an unknown tongue is a sign to unbelievers in the sense that Isaiah’s words <span class="cite-ref">(857)</span> bear, the method of procedure, which Paul here prescribes, is different. For he allows of other tongues in such a way that, interpretation being joined with them, nothing is left obscure. He observes, therefore, a most admirable medium in correcting the fault of the Corinthians. On the one hand, he does not at all set aside any gift of God whatever, <span class="cite-ref">(858)</span> in order that all his benefits may be seen among believers. On the other hand he makes a limitation — that ambition do not usurp the place that is due to the glory of God, and that no gift of inferior importance stand in the way of those that are of chief moment; and he adds the <em>sauce </em><span class="cite-ref">(859)</span> — that there be no mere ostentation, devoid of advantage. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(857)</span> The words referred to are those which Paul had quoted above in <span class="bvs">1Co_14:21</span>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(858)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tant petit soit-il</span>;” — “Be it ever so small.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(859)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ascauoir l’interpretation</span>;” — “Namely, the interpretation.” </p></div></div>
