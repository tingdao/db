<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Both we. </em>Because they had not all one revelation, it is no marvel if their judgments were diverse. For seeing these holy men knew that there consisted much in the life or death of one man, they would not have him to come in danger rashly. And their desire is worthy [of] praise, in that they desired to provide for the common safety of the Church by keeping back Paul. But, on the other side, Paul’s constancy deserveth so much the more praise, when as he continueth so steadfast<span class="cite-ref">(463)</span> in the calling of God. For he was not ignorant what great trouble he should suffer by reason of his bands. But because he knoweth the will of God, which was his only rule in taking counsel, he maketh no account of all other things, that he may follow it. And, assuredly, we must be so subject to the will and pleasure of God, that no profit, no kind of reason may remove us from obeying him.<span class="cite-ref">(464)</span> When Paul doth reprehend the brethren, because they afflict his heart with weeping, he doth sufficiently declare that he was not hardened,<span class="cite-ref">(465)</span> but that he was brought unto some feeling and suffering together with them.<span class="cite-ref">(466)</span> Therefore, the tears of the godly did wound his heart; but that softness did not turn him out of the way, but that he proceeded to follow God with a straight course. Therefore, we must use such courtesy toward our brethren, that the beck or will of God have always the upper hand. Now Paul doth again declare by his answer, that the servants of Christ cannot be prepared to do their duty, unless they despise death; and that none can ever be well encouraged to live to the Lord, but those who will willingly lay down their lives for the testimony of the truth.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(463)</span></p><p>“ Inflexibilis,” inflexible, </p><p><span class="cite-note">(464)</span></p><p>“ A simplici ejus obsequio,” from simple obedience to him. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(465)</span></p><p>“ Ferreum,” iron-hearted. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(466)</span></p><p>“ Quin amore ad<span class="lang el-gr">συμπαθειαν</span>induceretur,” but by love was induced to sympathy. </p></div></div>
