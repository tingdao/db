<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>I have become a fool </em>Hitherto he had, by various apologies, solicited their forgiveness for what was contrary to his own custom and manner of acting, and contrary, also, to propriety, and what was due to his office as an Apostle — the publishing of his own praises. <em>Now, </em>instead of soliciting, he upbraids, throwing the blame upon the Corinthians, who ought to have been beforehand in this. <span class="cite-ref">(916)</span> For when the false Apostles calumniated Paul, they should have set themselves vigorously in opposition to them, and should have faithfully borne the testimony that was due to his excellences. He chides them, however, thus early, lest those, who were unfavorably disposed towards them, should put a wrong construction upon the defense which he brought forward, in consequence of his being constrained to it by their ingratitude, <span class="cite-ref">(917)</span> or should persist in calumniating him. </p><p><em>For in nothing </em>We are ungrateful to God, if we allow his gifts, of which we are witnesses, to be disparaged, or contemned. He charges the Corinthians with this fault, for they knew him to be equal to the<em>chiefest Apostles, </em>and yet they lent an ear to calumniators, when they slandered him. </p><p>By the <em>chiefest Apostles </em>some understand his rivals, who arrogated to themselves the precedence. <span class="cite-ref">(918)</span> I understand it, however, as meaning — those that were chief among the twelve. “Let me be compared with any one of the Apostles, <span class="cite-ref">(919)</span> I have no fear, that I shall be found inferior.” For, although Paul was on the best of terms with all the Apostles, so that he was prepared to extol them above himself, he, nevertheless, contended against their names when falsely assumed. <span class="cite-ref">(920)</span> For the false Apostles abused this pretext, that they had been in the company of the twelve — that they were in possession of all their views <span class="cite-ref">(921)</span> — that they were fully acquainted with all their institutions, and the like. Hence Paul, perceiving that they falsely gloried in these masks and counterfeit titles, and were successful, to some extent, among unlearned persons, <span class="cite-ref">(922)</span> reckoned it necessary to enter upon a comparison of that nature. <span class="cite-ref">(923)</span></p><p>The correction that he adds — <em>though I am nothing, </em>means, that Paul was not disposed to claim any thing as his own, but simply <em>gloried in the Lord, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_10:17</span>,) unless, perhaps, you prefer to consider this as a concession, in which he makes mention of what is thrown out against him by adversaries and slanderers. <span class="cite-ref">(924)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(916)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui deuoyent les premiers faire cet office — ascauoir de le loyer</span>;” — “Who ought to have been the first to discharge that office — that of praising him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(917)</span> “The Apostle, in defending himself, was aware how near he approached the <em>language </em>of a <em>fool, </em>that is, a man desirous of vain glory, and how liable what he had written was to be attributed to that motive.
