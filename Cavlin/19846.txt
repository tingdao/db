<div class="comment-content"><p>Here God explains the object he had in view, even to make another trial whether the Jews were healable, so that the teaching of the Prophet might be conducive to their salvation. But he uses the particle <span class="lang he-il">אולי</span><em>auli, </em>“it may be,” which implies a doubt; because they had so often, and for so long a time, and in such various ways, shewed themselves to be so obstinate that hardly a hope could be entertained of their repentance. God, however, shews that he was not wearied, provided there remained in them still the smallest particle of religion. <em>It may be then, </em>he says, <em>that the house of Judah will hear all the evil, etc. </em></p><p>We have seen how the Prophet labored, not only to terrify his own nation by threatenings, but also sweetly to allure them to the service of God; but God speaks here of them as of perverse men, who were almost intractable, according to what is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_18:26</span>, that God would be severe towards the perverse; for God deals with men according to their disposition. As the Jews then were unworthy that God should, according to his gentleness, teach them as children, this only remained for them, to repent under the influence of fear. <em>It may be, </em>he says, that they will <em>bear all the evil, </em>etc. We now see why God touches only on threatenings, for this alone remained for men so obstinate. </p><p>He says, <em>The evil which I think to do, </em>etc. God here transfers to himself what belongs to men; for he does not think or deliberate with himself; but as we cannot comprehend his incomprehensible counsel, he sometimes assumes the person of man; and this is what is common in Scripture. But he says, that he <em>thinks </em>of what he <em>pronounces </em>in his word; for as long as God exhorts men to repent, he holds, as it were, his hand suspended, and allows an opportunity to repent. He then says, that he is, as it were, in the midst of his deliberations: as when one wants to know whether an offender will submit, so God transforms himself, in a manner, into what man is, when he says, <em>I think; </em>that is, let them know that vengeance is not in vain denounced in my word; for I will perform whatever I now threaten, except they repent. </p><p>He says, <em>That they may turn every one from his evil way </em>This is to <em>hear, </em>previously mentioned, even when men become seriously touched, so as to be displeased with their vices, and to desire from the heart to surrender themselves to God. He joins a promise, for without the hope of pardon it cannot be, that men will repent, as it has been often said; but it must be repeated, because few understand that faith cannot be separated from repentance; and a sinner can never be induced to return truly to God, unless he entertains a hope of pardon, for this is a main truth, according to what is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_130:4</span>, </p><p>“With thee is mercy, that thou mayest be feared.” </p><p>Then, according to what is commonly done, the Prophet says, that if the Jews turned to God, he would be propitious to them, as though he had said, that men would not be disappointed, if they repent, because God would readily meet them, and be reconciled to them: for this one thing alone, as I have said, is what can encourage us to repent, that is, when we are convinced that God is ready to give us pardon. He mentions <em>iniquity and sin. </em>The Prophet, no doubt, referred to these two words, in order to shew that we ought by no means to despair, though sins be heaped on sins.
