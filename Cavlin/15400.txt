<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>He shall protect thee with his wings. </em>This figure, which is employed in other parts of Scripture, is one which beautifully expresses the singularly tender care with which God watches over our safety. When we consider the majesty of God, there is nothing which would suggest a likeness such as is here drawn between him and the hen or other birds, who spread their wings over their young ones to cherish and protect them. But, in accommodation to our infirmity, he does not scruple to descend, as it were, from the heavenly glory which belongs to him, and to encourage us to approach him under so humble a similitude. Since he condescends in such a gracious manner to our weakness, surely there is nothing to prevent us from coming to him with the greatest freedom. By <em>the truth of God, </em>which, the Psalmist says, would be his <em>shield </em>and <em>buckler, </em>we must understand Godâ€™s faithfulness, as never deserting his people in the time of their need; still we cannot doubt that he had in his eye the Divine promises, for it is only by looking to these that any can venture to cast themselves upon the protection of God. As, without the word, we cannot come to the enjoyment of that Divine mercy of which the Psalmist had already spoken, he now comes forward himself to bear witness in behalf of it. Formerly, under the comparison of a <em>fortress, </em>he had taught that by trusting in God we shall enjoy safety and security; now he compares God to a <em>shield, </em>intimating that he will come between us and all our enemies to preserve us from their attacks. </p></div>
