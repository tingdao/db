<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Watch ye</em>. A short exhortation, but of great weight. He exhorts them to <em>watch, </em>in order that Satan may not oppress them, finding them off their guard. For as the warfare is incessant, the <em>watching </em>requires to be incessant too. Now watchfulness of spirit is this — when, free and disentangled from earthly cares, we meditate on the things of God. For as the body is weighed down by <em>surfeiting and drunkenness, </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_21:34</span>,) so as to be fit for nothing, so the cares and lusts of the world, idleness or carelessness, are like a spiritual surfeiting that overpowers the mind. <span class="cite-ref">(169)</span></p><p>The <em>second </em>thing is that they <em>persevere in the faith, </em>or that they hold fast the faith, so as to <em>stand firm; </em>because that is the foundation on which we rest. It is certain, however, that he points out the means of perseverance — by resting upon God with a firm faith. </p><p>In the <em>third </em>exhortation, which is much of the same nature, he stirs them up to manly fortitude. And, as we are naturally weak, he exhorts them <em>fourthly to </em>strengthen themselves, or gather strength. For where we render it <em>be strong, </em>Paul makes use of only one word, which is equivalent to <em>strengthen yourselves. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(169)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sont comme vne yurongnerie spirituelle, qui assopit et estourdit l’entendement</span>;” — “Are like a spiritual drunkenness, which makes the mind drowsy and stupid.” </p></div></div>
