<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And his grace was not vain. </em>Those that set free-will in opposition to the grace of God, that whatever good we do may not be ascribed wholly to Him, wrest these words to suit their own interpretation — as if Paul boasted, that he had by his own industry taken care that God’s grace toward him had not been misdirected. Hence they infer, that God, indeed, offers his grace, but that the right use of it is in man’s own power, and that it is in his own power to prevent its being ineffectual. I maintain, however, that these words of Paul give no support to their error, for he does not here claim anything as his own, as if he had himself, independently of God, done anything praiseworthy. What then? That he might not seem to glory to no purpose in mere words, while devoid of reality, he says, that he affirms nothing that is not openly apparent. Farther, even admitting that these words intimate, that Paul did not abuse the grace of God, and did not render it ineffectual by his negligence, I maintain, nevertheless, that there is no reason on that account, why we should divide between him and God the praise, that ought to be ascribed wholly to God, inasmuch as he confers upon us not merely the power of doing well, but also the inclination and the accomplishment. </p><p><em>But more abundantly </em>Some refer this to vain-glorious boasters, <span class="cite-ref">(26)</span> who, by detracting from Paul, endeavored to set off themselves and their goods to advantage, as, in their opinion at least, it is not likely that he wished to enter upon a contest with the Apostles. When he compares himself, however, with the Apostles, he does so merely for the sake of those wicked persons, who were accustomed to bring them forward for the purpose of detracting from his reputation, as we see in the Epistle to the Galatians (<span class="bvs">Gal_1:11</span>.) Hence the probability is, that it is of the Apostles that he speaks, when he represents his own labors as superior to theirs, and it is quite true, that he was superior to others, not merely in respect of his enduring many hardships, encountering many dangers, abstaining from things lawful, and perseveringly despising all <em>perils; </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_11:26</span>;) but also because the Lord gave to his labors a much larger measure of success. <span class="cite-ref">(27)</span> For I take <em>labor </em>here to mean the fruit of his labor that appeared. </p><p><em>Not I, but the grace </em>The old translator, by leaving out the article, has given occasion of mistake to those that are not acquainted with the Greek language, for in consequence of his having rendered the words thus — <em>not I, but the grace of God with me, </em><span class="cite-ref">(28)</span> they thought that only the half of the praise is ascribed to God, and that the other half is reserved for man. They, accordingly, understand the meaning to be that Paul labored not alone, inasmuch as he could do nothing without co-operating grace, <span class="cite-ref">(29)</span> but at the same time it was under the influence of his own free-will, and by means of his own strength. His words, however, have quite a different meaning, for what he had said was his own, he afterwards, correcting himself, ascribes wholly to the grace of God — <em>wholly, </em>I say, not in part, for whatever he might have seemed to do, was <em>wholly, </em>he declares, the work of grace. A remarkable passage certainly, both for laying low the pride of man, and for magnifying the operation of Divine grace in us. For Paul, as though he had improperly made himself the author of anything good, corrects what he had said, and declares the <em>grace of God </em>to have been the efficient cause of the whole. Let us not think that there is here a mere pretense of humility <span class="cite-ref">(30)</span> It is in good earnest that he speaks thus, and from knowing that it is so in truth. Let us learn, therefore, that we have nothing that is good, but what the Lord has graciously given us, that we do nothing good but what he <em>worketh in us, </em>(<span class="bvs">Phi_2:13</span>) — not that we do nothing ourselves, but that we do nothing without being influenced — that is, under the guidance and impulse of the Holy Spirit. </p><p><strong>(26)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Thrasones</span>.” See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 98, n. 1. </p><p><strong>(27)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Dieu donnoit plus heureuse issue a ses labeurs, et les faisoit prou-fiter plus amplement</span>;” — “God gave to his labors a more prosperous issue, and made them much more successful.” </p><p><strong>(28)</strong> In the Alexandrine MS. the reading is: <em>But not I, but the grace of God with me. </em>— <em>Corresponding </em>to this is the rendering of Wiclif, <em>(1380,) </em>— <em>But not I, but the grace of God with me. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(29)</strong> See <em>Institutes, </em>volume 1. </p><p><strong>(30)</strong><em>Heideggerus </em>seems to have had Calvin’s exposition here in his view in the following observations on the expression made use of by the Apostle: “Non <em>Gratia Dei meoum, </em>uti vetus Itala vertit, quasi effectus inter Gra-tiam Dei, et Pauli arbitrium distribueretur; nihil enim habuit ipse, quod non acceperit; sed<span class="lang el-gr">Οὐκ ἐγὼ δε, ἀλλἀ ἡ χάρις τοῦ Θεοῦ σὺν ἐμοί</span><em>mecum, </em>ut totum et in solidum omne gratiae soli acceptum feratur. Neque ita loquitur solius humilitatis et modestiae explieandae ergo, quanquam et hanc testari voluit; sed quia po-tens illa gratia demonstratio et testimonium irrefragabile erat resurrectionis Domini.” — “Not the <em>grace of God with me, </em>as the old Italic version renders it, as though the effect were divided between God’s grace and Paul’s free-will; for he has nothing that he has not received, but <span class="lang el-gr">ἡ σὺν ἐμοί</span><em>, which with me</em>, that every thing may be wholly and entirely ascribed to grace alone. Nor does he speak thus, merely for the purpose of showing humility and modesty, though he had it also in view to testify this, but because that grace was a powerful demonstration and irrefragable testimony of our Lord’s resurrection.” — Heideggeri Labores Exegetici in Cor. (Tiguri. 1700). — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
