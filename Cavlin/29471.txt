<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>As also in all the world it brings forth fruit. </em>This has a tendency both to confirm and to comfort the pious — to see the effect of the gospel far and wide in gathering many to Christ. The faith of it does not, it is true, depend on its success, as though <em>we </em>should believe it on the ground that <em>many </em>believe it. Though the whole world should fail, though heaven itself should fall, the conscience of a pious man must not waver, because God, on whom it is founded, does nevertheless remain true. This, however, does not hinder our faith from being confirmed, whenever it perceives God’s excellence, which undoubtedly shews itself with more power in proportion to the number of persons that are gained over to Christ. </p><p>In addition to this, in the multitude of the believers at that time there was beheld an accomplishment of the many predictions which extend the reign of Christ from the East to the West. Is it a trivial or common aid to faith, to see accomplished before our eyes what the Prophets long since predicted as to the extending of the kingdom of Christ through all countries of the world? What I speak of, there is no believer that does not experience in himself. Paul accordingly had it in view to encourage the Colossians the more by this statement, that, by seeing in various places the fruit and progress of the gospel, they might embrace it with more eager zeal. <span class="lang el-gr">Αὐξανόμενον</span>, which I have rendered <em>propagatur </em>, (<em>is propagated</em>,) does not occur in some copies; but, from its suiting better with the context, I did not choose to omit it. It also appears front the commentaries of the ancients that this reading was always the more generally received. <span class="cite-ref">(284)</span></p><p><em>Since the day ye heard it, and knew the grace. </em>Here he praises them on account of their docility, inasmuch as they immediately embraced sound doctrine; and he praises them on account of their constancy, inasmuch as they persevered in it. It is also with propriety that the faith of the gospel is called the <em>knowledge of God’s grace</em>; for no one has ever tasted of the gospel but the man that knew himself to be reconciled to God, and took hold of the salvation that is held forth in Christ. </p><p><em>In truth </em>means <em>truly </em>and <em>without pretense</em>; for as he had previously declared that the gospel is undoubted truth, so he now adds, that it had been purely administered by them, and that <em>by Epaphras</em>. For while all boast that they preach the gospel, and yet at the same time there are many <em>evil workers</em>, (<span class="bvs">Phi_3:2</span>,) through whose ignorance, or ambition, or avarice, its purity is adulterated, it is of great importance that faithful ministers should be distinguished from the less upright. For it is not enough to hold the term gospel, unless we know that this is the true gospel — what was preached by Paul and Epaphras. Hence Paul confirms the doctrine of Epaphras by giving it his approbation, that he may induce the Colossians to adhere to it, and may, by the same means, call them back from those profligates who endeavored to introduce strange doctrines. He at the same time dignifies Epaphras with a special distinction, that he may have more authority among them; and lastly, he presents him to the Colossians in an amiable aspect, by saying that he had borne testimony to him of their love. Paul everywhere makes it his particular aim, that he may, by his recommendation, render those who he knows serve Christ faithfully, very dear to the Churches; as, on the other hand, the ministers of Satan are wholly intent on alienating, by unfavourable representations, <span class="cite-ref">(285)</span> the minds of the simple from faithful pastors. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(284)</span> “This” (<span class="lang el-gr">καὶ αὐξανόμενον</span>) “is the reading of the Vatican and all the most ancient authorities.” — <em>Penn</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(285)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par faux rapports et calomnies</span>;” — “By false reports and calumnies.” </p></div></div>
