<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong><em>How will they be raised up? </em>There is nothing that is more at variance with human reason than this article of faith. For who but God alone could persuade us that bodies, which are now liable to corruption, will, after having rotted away, or after they have been consumed by fire, or torn in pieces by wild beasts, will not merely be restored entire, but in a greatly better condition. Do not all our apprehensions of things straightway reject this as a thing fabulous, nay, most absurd? <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> Paul, with the view of removing entirely this appearance of absurdity, makes use of an <em>anhypophora, </em><span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> that is, he brings forward by way of objection, in the person of another, what appears at first view to be at variance with the doctrine of a resurrection. For this question is not that of one who inquires doubtingly as to the mode, but of one who argues from impossibility — that is, what is said as to the resurrection is a thing incredible. Hence in his reply he repels such an objection with severity. Let us observe, then, that the persons who are here introduced as speaking, are those who endeavor to disparage, in a way of scoffing, a belief in the resurrection, on the ground of its being a thing that is impossible. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(100)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme la plus grande absux, dite du monde</span>;” — “As the greatest absurdity in the world.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span> See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 281, n. 1. </p></div></div>
