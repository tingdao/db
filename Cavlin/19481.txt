<div class="comment-content"><p>Here, again, the Prophet confirms what he had said of the severe vengeance which God would take on Jeconiah. And though he was in his thirty-seventh year brought out of prison, and admitted unto the royal table, among other princes, he yet died in exile; and perhaps it would have been better for him to continue in prison till his death than to have been corrupted by allurements when he became one of the princes, for he thus defiled himself. However this may have been, he died in exile together with his mother Nehusta. </p><p>The Prophet then enhanced the grievousness of his punishment by saying, <em>I will cause thee to migrate, </em>or cast thee out, <span class="cite-ref">(67)</span><em>and thy mother who bare thee. </em>It is added, for the sake of indignity, that the mother of the king would be led captive with him; for the female sex is often spared, and she was also advanced in years. But God executed upon her his judgment, because she was his associate in impiety: “I will remove you,” he says, <em>“into foreign lands, in which ye were not born, and there ye shall die.” </em></p><p><strong>(67)</strong> The word is strong; it means to toss, to hurl, violently to cast forth, to throw with force, as one throws a missile weapon. See <span class="bvs">1Sa_28:11</span>. The “mittam “ of the Vulg. is too weak; the “<span class="lang el-gr">ἀποῤῥίψω</span> ” of the Sept. is more suitable. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
