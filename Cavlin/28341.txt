<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Who is the first-fruit, etc. </em>This is an allusion to the rites of the law; for as men are sanctified to God by faith, they who first offer themselves are fitly called the first-fruit. Whosoever then is called first in time to the faith, Paul allows him the prerogative of honor: yet he retains this eminence only when the end corresponds with the beginning. And doubtless it is no common honor when God chooses some for first-fruits: and there is in addition a greater and an ampler trial of faith, through a longer space of time, provided they who have first begun are not wearied in their course. <span class="cite-ref">(474)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(474)</span> Epaenetus, who is here called the first-fruit of Achaia, may have been off the family of Stephanas, who is said to have been the first-fruit in <span class="bvs">1Co_16:15</span>. But the majority of copies has Asia<span class="lang el-gr">, Ασίας, </span> here, instead of Achaia, <span class="lang el-gr">Αχαίας. </span> By Asia is often meant Asia Minor, and so here, no doubt, if it be the right reading. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
