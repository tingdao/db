<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>I am not mad. </em>Paul is not angry, neither doth he sharply reprehend Festus for his blasphemous speech; yea, he speaketh unto him with great submission.<span class="cite-ref">(626)</span> For it was no place for reprehension, and it became him to pardon the ignorance of the man, seeing he did not set himself face to face against God. Also, he had respect unto his person [office]. For though he were unworthy of honor, yet was he in authority. And yet for all that he doth not therefore give place to his blasphemy, but he defendeth the glory of the word of God. Whereby we do also see, that not caring for himself, he did only take thought for his doctrine. For he doth not vaunt of his wit;<span class="cite-ref">(627)</span> he doth not labor in defense of his wisdom; but he is content with this defense alone, that he teacheth nothing but that which is true and sober.</p><p>Furthermore, [the] truth is set against<span class="cite-ref">(628)</span> all manner [of] fallacies and fraud: sobriety against all manner [of] frivolous speculations and thorny subtilties, which are only seeds of contention. Paul doth, indeed, refute Festus’ error; yet we may gather by this, which is the best manner of teaching, to wit, that which is not only clean from all fallacies and deceit, but also doth not make the minds of men drunk with vain questions, and doth not nourish foolish curiosity, nor an intemperate desire to know more than is meet, but is moderate and good for sound edification.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(626)</span></p><p>“ Honorifice eum corrpellat,” addresses him in terms of honour. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(627)</span></p><p>“ Acumen,” acuteness. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(628)</span></p><p>“ Opponitur,” is opposed to. </p></div></div>
