<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Be it known unto you. </em>Peter might (as I have already said) have turned aside unto many starting-holes, <span class="cite-ref">(206)</span> if he would not have entered the cause; <span class="cite-ref">(207)</span> but because the miracle was wrought, to this end, that the name of Christ might be glorified, he descendeth by and by unto this. For he knew that he was the minister of such excellent power of God, that he might have a seal to confirm his doctrine. In the meanwhile, the wicked, will they, nil they, are enforced to hear that which they would have had buried full deep. When they have done what they can, this is all; they cause Peter to avouch and object to their faces, that wherewith they were so grieved, when it was spoken to others. And, first he maketh Christ the author of the miracle. Secondly, because it seemed to be an absurd and incredible thing, that a dead man should be endued with divine power, he testifieth that Christ is alive, because God hath raised him up from the dead, howsoever they had crucified him. So that the miracle giveth him occasion to preach the resurrection of Christ. And by this testimony Peter meant to prove that he was the true Messias. He saith that they had crucified him, not only to the end he may upbraid this unto them, that they may acknowledge their fault; but also that they may understand that they have in vain striven against God; and so, consequently, cease to rage so unluckily and with such deadly success. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(206)</span> “Subterfugia,” subterfuges. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(207)</span> “Si noluisset causam ingredi,” if he had been unwilling to enter upon the cause. </p></div></div>
