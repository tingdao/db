<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>God shall likewise destroy thee for ever. </em>From these words it is made still more evident that his object in dwelling upon the aggravated guilt of Doeg, was to prove the certainty of his approaching doom, and this rather for his own conviction and comfort, than with a view to alarming the conscience of the offender. Accordingly, he declares his persuasion that God would not allow his treachery to pass unpunished, though he might for a time connive at the perpetration of it. The ungodly are disposed, so long as their prosperity continues, to indulge in undisturbed security; and the saint of God, when he sees the power of which they are possessed, and witnesses their proud contempt of the divine judgments, is too apt to be overwhelmed with unbelieving apprehensions. But in order to establish his mind in the truth which he announces, it is observable that the Psalmist heaps one expression upon another, — God shall <em>destroy thee, take thee away, pluck thee out, root thee out, </em>— as if by this multiplicity of words he would convince himself more effectually, that God was able to overthrow this adversary with all his boasted might and authority. <span class="cite-ref">(278)</span> In adding that God would root him out of his <em>dwelling-place </em>or <em>tent, </em><span class="cite-ref">(279)</span> and <em>out of the land of the living, </em>he insinuates that the wicked will be destroyed by God, however securely they may seem to repose ir the nest of some comfortable mansion, and in the vain hope of living upon earth for ever. Possibly he may allude, in mentioning a <em>tent, </em>to the profession of Doeg, as shepherds have their dwelling in tents. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(278)</span> “Wonderful,” says Bishop Horne, “is the force of the verbs in the original, which convey to us the four ideas of ‘laying prostrate,’ ‘dissolving as by fire,’ ‘sweeping away as with a besom,’ and ‘totally extirpating root and branch,’ as a tree eradicated from the spot on which it grew.” The second verb, <span class="lang he-il">יחתך</span>, <em>yachtecha</em>, Bythner explains, “<em>will snatch thee away</em>, as one snatches fire from a hearth. From <span class="lang he-il">חתה</span>,<em>chatheh</em>, he <em>snatched off live coals or fire from one place to another</em>. ” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(279)</span> There is another interpretation of this expression which may here be stated. It has been thought that the allusion is to God’s tabernacle. “<span class="lang he-il">מאהל</span>,<em>meohel</em>, ” says Hammond, “is literally ‘from the tabernacle,’ not ‘from <em>thy </em>dwelling-place:’ and so the LXX. render it, ‘<span class="lang el-gr">Απὸ σκηνώματος</span>,’ ‘from the tabernacle;’ and though the Latin, and Syriac, and Arabic, have added <em>tuo </em>,<em>thy</em>, yet neither will the Hebrew bear, nor do the Chaldee acknowledge it, who read by way of paraphrase, ‘He shall cause thee to depart from inhabiting in the place of the Schechina, or tabernacle, the place of God’s presence.’” Hammond supposes that the expression is to be understood “of the censure of excommunication, which in the last and highest degree was <em>Schammatha</em>, delivering up the offender to the hand of heaven to be cut off, himself and his posterity.” “Doeg,” says Archbishop Secker, “had no office in the tabernacle; but it seems, by his history, that he frequented it, which he might do to seem a good man. And there seems an opposition between his being plucked out of God’s dwelling-place, and David’s continuing in the house of God, verse eighth.” </p></div></div>
