<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>In which ye walked. </em>Erasmus mistakingly refers this to men, rendering it, “<em>inter quos </em>,” (“among <em>whom</em>, ”) for there can be no doubt that Paul had in view the vices, in which he, says that the Colossians had walked, during the time that they lived in them. For <em>living </em>and <em>walking </em>differ from each other, as power does from action. <em>Living </em>holds the first place: <em>walking </em>comes afterwards, as in <span class="bvs">Gal_5:25</span>, </p><p>If ye live in the SPIRIT, WALK also in the Spirit. </p><p>By these words he intimates, that it were an unseemly thing that they should addict themselves any more to the vices, to which they had died through Christ. See the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. It is an argument from a withdrawment of the cause to a withdrawment of the effect. </p></div>
