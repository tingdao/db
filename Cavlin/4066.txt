<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>If there be a prophet among you. </em>He makes mention of two methods by which the will of God was wont to be revealed to the prophets, viz., visions and dreams. He does not, however, here use the word <span class="lang he-il">חזון</span><em>chazon, </em><span class="cite-ref">(42)</span> which signifies a prophecy as well as a vision, but <span class="lang he-il">מראה</span>, <em>marah, </em>expressive of some visible appearance, which confirms and ratifies the truth of His word <em>(oraculi) </em>to the eyes and all the senses. Thus has God often appeared to His servants, so that His majesty might be inscribed upon His addresses to them. Before the giving of the Law such visions were frequently vouchsafed to the Patriarchs; whilst sometimes they were instructed by dreams. Thus Joel, when he promises that under the kingdom of Christ there shall be a complete fullness of all revelations, also enumerates these two forms of them, </p><p>“Your sons (he says) and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joe_2:28</span>.) </p><p>But we know that the prophets described the kingdom of Christ under the likeness of their own times: when, therefore, God sets forth these two ordinary modes of revelation, he withdraws Moses from the condition of others, as if to exalt him by a special privilege. Now, since Aaron and Miriam were not superior to others, they were thus reminded that they were far behind Moses in rank. With this view he is said to be “faithful in all God’s house;” in quoting which passage in order to prove his inferiority to Christ, the Apostle says he was <em>a servant, </em>and a member of the Church, whereas Christ was its Lord and builder, or creator. (<span class="bvs">Heb_3:2</span>.) But the difference between them is more clearly specified immediately afterwards, viz., that God speaks to him “mouth to mouth,” by which expression, as I have said elsewhere, <span class="cite-ref">(43)</span> more intimate and familiar communication is denoted. Still God does not thus deprive the prophets of anything which is requisite for the discharge of their office; but merely establishes Moses as the chief of them all. It is true, indeed, that the Patriarchs are so ranked, as Abraham was called a prophet by the mouth of God, (<span class="bvs">Gen_20:7</span>;) and the Prophet thus names him together with Isaac and Jacob in <span class="bvs">Psa_105:15</span>; but still God at the same time includes the whole dispensation, which He afterwards chose to employ under the Law; and so prefers Moses to all who were hereafter to arise. </p><p>Further, the word <em>vision </em>is used in a different sense from that which it had just above; for God, distinguishing Moses from others, says that He speaks with him <em>in vision, </em><span class="cite-ref">(44)</span> which it would be absurd to explain as meaning an ordinary or common vision. It therefore here signifies actual sight, <span class="cite-ref">(45)</span> which He contrasts with “dark speeches <em>(aenigmata) </em>and similitude,” which word is equivalent to a representation <em>(figura,) </em>if the negative be referred to both. For there are some who take similitude for a lively and express image; as if God should assert that He reveals His face to Moses; and therefore read the clause <em>adversatively, </em>as I have given it in the margin. But the former reading is the most natural. </p><p>I have elsewhere treated of dreams and visions. It will then be sufficient to give the sum in one word, namely, that they were seals for the confirmation of prophecies; so that the Prophets, as if sent from heaven, might with full confidence declare themselves to be God’s lawful interpreters. For visions had their own peculiar marks, to distinguish them from phantoms and false imaginations; and dreams also were accompanied by their signs, in order to remove all doubt of their authenticity. The prophets, therefore, were fully conscious of their vocation, so that nothing was wanting to the assurance of faith. Meanwhile, the false prophets dressed themselves up in these masks to deceive. Thus Jeremiah, in refutation of their ungodly <em>pretences, </em>says, </p><p>“The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat, saith the Lord?” (<span class="bvs">Jer_23:28</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(42)</span><span class="lang he-il">חזון</span>, a vision, from <span class="lang he-il">חזה</span>, to see, to look upon. <span class="lang he-il">מראה</span>, either the act of sight, or the object of sight; a seeing, or an appearance, from <span class="lang he-il">ראה</span>, to see, to perceive. — W. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(43)</span> On <span class="bvs">Exo_33:11</span>, <em>ante, </em>vol. 3, p. 372. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(44)</span><em>A.V. </em>“apparently.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(45)</span> “Veue, ou regard de quelque figure visible;” the view or look of some visible figure. — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
