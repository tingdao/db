<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And Rachel and Leah answered</em>. Here we perceive that to be fulfilled which Paul teaches, that all things work together for good to the children of God. (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:28</span>.) For since the wives of Jacob had been unjustly treated by their father, they so far act in opposition to the natural tenderness of their sex, that at the desire of their husband, they become willing to follow him into a distant and unknown region. Therefore, if Jacob is compelled to take many and very bitter draughts of grief, he is now cheered by the most satisfying compensation, that his wives are not separated from him by their attachment to their father’s house: but rather, being overcome by the irksome nature of their sufferings, they earnestly undertake to join him in his flight. “There is nothing,” they say, “which should cause us to remain with our father; for daughters adhere to their fathers, because they are esteemed members of his family; but what a cruel rejection is this, not only that he has passed us off without dowry, <span class="cite-ref">(92)</span> but that he has set us to sale, and has devoured the price for which he sold us?” By the word <em>money </em>(<span class="bvs">Gen_31:15</span>), I understand the price of sale. For they complain that, at least, they had not received, instead of dowry, the profit which had been unjustly extorted from their husband, but this gain also had been unjustly suppressed by their covetous father. Therefore the particle <span class="lang he-il">גם</span> (<em>gam</em>) is inserted, which is used for the purpose of amplification among the Hebrews. For this increased not a little the meanness of Laban, that, as an insatiable whirlpool, he had absorbed the gain acquired by this most dishonorable traffic. And it is to be noted, that they were then devoted to their husband, and were therefore free to depart from their father; especially since they knew that the hand of God was stretched out to them. There is also no doubt, seeing they were persuaded that Jacob was a faithful prophet of God, but that they freely embraced the heavenly oracle from his mouth; for at the close of their reply, they show that they did not so much yield to his wish as to the command of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(92)</span> The word in the original is harsh, “prostituit.” </p></div></div>
