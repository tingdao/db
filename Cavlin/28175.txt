<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>But, O man! who art thou? etc. </em><span class="cite-ref">(303)</span> As it is a participle in Greek, we may read what follows in the present tense, <em>who disputest, </em>or contendest, or strivest in opposition to God; for it is expressed in Greek according to this meaning, — “Who art thou who enterest into a dispute with God?” But there is not much difference in the sense. <span class="cite-ref">(304)</span> In this first answer, he does nothing else but beat down impious blasphemy by an argument taken from the condition of man: he will presently subjoin another, by which he will clear the righteousness of God from all blame. </p><p>It is indeed evident that no cause is adduced higher than the will of God. Since there was a ready answer, that the difference depends on just reasons, why did not Paul adopt such a brief reply? But he placed the will of God in the highest rank for this reason, — that it alone may suffice us for all other causes. No doubt, if the objection had been false, that God according to his own will rejects those whom he honors not with his favor, and chooses those whom he gratuitously loves, a refutation would not have been neglected by Paul. The ungodly object and say, that men are exempted from blame, if the will of God holds the first place in their salvation, or in their perdition. Does Paul deny this? Nay, by his answer he confirms it, that is, that God determines concerning men, as it seems good to him, and that, men in vain and madly rise up to contend with God; for he assigns, by his own right, whatever lot he pleases to what he forms. </p><p>But they who say that Paul, wanting reason, had recourse to reproof, cast a grievous calumny on the Holy Spirit: for the things calculated to vindicate God’s justice, and ready at hand, he was at first unwilling to adduce, for they could not have been comprehended; yea, he so modifies his second reason, that he does not undertake a full defence, but in such a manner as to give a sufficient demonstration of God’s justice, if it be considered by us with devout humility and reverence. </p><p>He reminds man of what is especially meet for him to remember, that is, of his own condition; as though he had said, — “Since thou art man, thou ownest thyself to be dust and ashes; why then doest thou contend with the Lord about that which thou art not able to understand?” In a word, the Apostle did not bring forward what might have been said, but what is suitable to our ignorance. Proud men clamour, because Paul, admitting that men are rejected or chosen by the secret counsel of God, alleges no cause; as though the Spirit of God were silent for want of reason, and not rather, that by his silence he reminds us, that a mystery which our minds cannot comprehend ought to be reverently adored, and that he thus checks the wantonness of human curiosity. Let us then know, that God does for no other reason refrain from speaking, but that he sees that we cannot contain his immense wisdom in our small measure; and thus regarding our weakness, he leads us to moderation and sobriety. </p><p><em>Does what is formed? etc. </em>We see that Paul dwells continually on this, — that the will of God, though its reason is hid from us, is to be counted just; for he shows that he is deprived of his right, if he is not at liberty to determine what he sees meet concerning his creatures. This seems unpleasant to the ears of many. There are also those who pretend that God is exposed to great reproach were such a power ascribed to him, as though they in their fastidiousness were better divines than Paul, who has laid down this as the rule of humility to the faithful, that they are to admire the sovereignty of God, and not to estimate it by their own judgment. </p><p>But he represses this arrogance of contending with God by a most apt similitude, in which he seems to have alluded to <span class="bvs">Isa_45:9</span>, rather than to <span class="bvs">Jer_18:6</span>; for nothing else is taught us by Jeremiah, than that Israel was in the hand of the Lord, so that he could for his sins wholly break him in pieces, as a potter the earthen vessel. But Isaiah ascends higher, “Woe to him,” he says, “who speaks against his maker;” that is, the pot that contends with the former of the clay; “shall the clay say to its former, what doest thou?” etc. And surely there is no reason for a mortal man to think himself better than earthen vessel, when he compares himself with God. We are not however to be over-particular in applying this testimony to our present subject, since Paul only meant to allude to the words of the Prophet, in order that the similitude might have more weight. <span class="cite-ref">(305)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(303)</span> “But” is not sufficiently emphatical here<span class="lang el-gr">; μενοῦνγε; </span> “yes, verily,” in <span class="bvs">Rom_10:18</span>; “yea, rather,” in <span class="bvs">Luk_11:28</span>; “doubtless,” in <span class="bvs">Phi_3:8</span>; it may be rendered here, “nay, rather.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(304)</span> “Quis es qui contendas judicio cum Deo<span class="lang el-gr">;” τίς εἶ ὁ ἀνταποκρινόμενος τῳ Θεῳ </span> “that repliest against God,” is the rendering of [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] <em>; “who </em>enterest into a debate with God,” is what [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] gives.
