<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Meat recommendeth us not to God </em>This was, or may have been, another pretext made use of by the Corinthians — that the worship of God does not consist in meats, as Paul himself teaches in his Epistle to the Romans, (<span class="bvs">Rom_14:17</span>,) that <em>the kingdom of God is not meat or drink </em>Paul answers: “We must at the same time take care that our liberty does not do injury to our neighbors.” In this he tacitly acknowledges, that in the sight of God it matters not what kinds of food we partake of, because he allows us the free use of them, so far as conscience is concerned; but that this liberty, as to the external use of it, is made subject to love. The argument of the Corinthians, therefore, was defective, inasmuch as they inferred the whole from a part, for in the use of them a regard to the claims of love is included. It is, therefore, certain, that <em>meat recommendeth us not to God; </em>and Paul acknowledges this, but he states this exception, that love is recommended to us by God, which it were criminal to overlook. </p><p><em>Neither if we eat, are we the better. </em>He does not speak of improvement as to the stomach; for the man who has dined has a better filled stomach than the man who goes fasting; but he means, that we have neither more nor less of righteousness from eating or from abstaining. Besides, he does not speak of every kind of abstinence, or of every kind of eating. For excess and luxury are in themselves displeasing to God, while sobriety and moderation are well-pleasing to him. But let it be understood by us, that <em>the kingdom of God</em>, which is spiritual, does not consist in these outward observances, and therefore, that things indifferent are in themselves of no importance in the sight of God. While he brings this forward in the person of others by <em>anthypophora </em>, <span class="cite-ref">(469)</span> he at the same time admits that it is true, for it is taken from his own doctrine, which we touched upon a little ago. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(469)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par une maniere d’anticipation</span>;” — “By way of anticipation.” <em>Anthrypophora </em> is a figure of speech which derives its name from the Greek term <span class="lang el-gr">ἀνθυποφορά</span>, a <em>reply to an objection </em>It is used in this sense by Dionysius Halicarnassensis. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
