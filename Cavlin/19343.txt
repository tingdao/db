<div class="comment-content"><p>He pursues the same subject: he says that all would die indiscriminately, the common people as well as the chief men, that none would be exempt from destruction; for God would make a great slaughter, both of the lower orders and also of the higher, who excelled in wealth, in honor, and dignity; <em>Die shall the great and the small. </em>It often happens in changes that the great are punished; and sometimes the case is that the common people perish, while the nobles are spared: but God declares, that such would be the destruction, that their enemies would make no difference between the common people and the higher ranks, and that if they escaped the hands of their enemies, the pestilence or the famine would prove their ruin. </p><p>He adds, <em>They shall not bury them, nor beat their breast for them; </em>and then, <em>they shall not eat themselves, nor make themselves bald for them </em><span class="cite-ref">(160)</span> This is not mentioned by the Prophet to commend what the people did; nor did he consider that in this respect they observed the command of the law; for God had forbidden them to imitate the corrupt customs of the heathens. (<span class="bvs">Lev_21:1</span>) We have already said, that the orientals were much given to external ceremonies, so that there was no moderation in their lamentations: therefore God intended to correct this excess. But the Prophet here has no respect to the command, that the Jews were to moderate their grief, — what then? He meant to shew, as I have already reminded you, that the slaughters would be so great, that they — would cause hardness and insensibility, being so immense as to stun the feelings of men. When any one dies, friends and neighbors meet, and shew respect to his memory; but when pestilence prevails, or when all perish by famine, the greater part become hardened and unmindful of themselves and others, and the offices of humanity are no longer observed. God then shews, that such would be the devastation of the land, that the Jews, as though callous and hardened, would no longer lament for one another. In short, he shews, that together with these dreadful slaughters, such insensibility and hardness would prevail among the Jews, that no husband would think of his wife, and no father of his children; but that all of them would be so astonied by their own evils as to become like the wild beasts. </p><p>He says further, <em>They shall not cut themselves nor pull off their hairs, </em>as they had used to do. These things are mentioned, as they were commonly done; it cannot be hence concluded, that they were approved by God; for God’s design was not to pronounce a judgment on their lamentation, on the tearing off of the hair, or on their incisions. It is indeed certain that these practices proceeded from the impetuous feelings of men, and were tokens of impatience; but as I have said, God does not speak here of what was lawful, but of what men were wont to do. </p><p>As to that part, where he says, that he had taken away his <em>kindness </em>and his <em>mercies, </em>he does not mean that he had changed his nature, but his object was to cut off occasion from all who might complain; for men, we know, whenever God’s hand presses hard on them, to make them to deplore rightly their miseries, are stifficiently ready to say, that God visits them with too much severity. He therefore shews that they were unworthy of kindness and mercies. At the same time he reminded them that there was no reason for hypocrites to entertain any hope, because Scripture so often commends the kindness of God and his mercy; for since they accumulated sins on sins, God could not do otherwise than come to an extremity with them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(160)</span> The first clause of the verse, as well as the last of the preceding, is omitted in the <em>Septuagint</em>, but retained in the <em>Vulgate, Syriac, </em>and the <em>Targum</em>. The verbs in the next clause ought to be rendered as transitives, — </p><p>They shall not bury <em>them </em>nor lament for them. </p><p>Then the two concluding verbs are to he rendered as impersonals, — </p><p>And there shall be no cutting nor making bald for them. </p><p>The Welsh is a <em>literal </em>version of the Hebrew, — </p><p>(lang. cy) Ac nid ymdorrir ac nid ymfoelir drostynt. </p><p>Nothing can be much more literal. The first verb is in Hithpael, and so the Welsh is; for like Hebrew it has a reciprocal form for its verbs. The last verb is also in Welsh in this form; but it needs not be so, for it might be, (lang. cy) <em>ac ni foelir </em> — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
