<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>They kept not the covenant of God. </em>This is the reason assigned for the Ephraimites turning their backs in the day of battle; and it explains why the divine assistance was withheld from them. Others, it is true, were guilty in this respect as well as they, but the vengeance of God executed on that tribe, which by its influence had corrupted almost the whole kingdom, is purposely brought forward as a general warning. Since then the tribe of Ephraim, in consequence of its splendor and dignity, when it threw off the yoke, encouraged and became as it were a standard of shameful revolt to all the other tribes, the prophet intended to put people on their guard, that they might not suffer themselves in their simplicity to be again deceived in the same manner. It is no light charge which he brings against the sons of Ephraim: he upbraids them on account of their perfidiousness in despising the whole law and in violating the covenant. Although he employs these two words, <em>law </em>and <em>covenant, </em>in the same sense; yet, in placing <em>the covenant </em>first, he clearly shows that he is speaking not only of the moral law, the all-perfect rule of life, but of the whole service of God, of the truth and faithfulness of the divine promises, and of the trust which ought to be reposed in them, <span class="cite-ref">(320)</span> of invocation, and of the doctrine of true religion, the foundation whereof was the adoption. He therefore calls them covenant-breakers, because they had fallen from their trust in the promises, by which God had entered into covenant with them to be their Father. Yet he afterwards very properly adds <em>the law, </em>in which the covenant was sealed up, as it were, in public records. He aggravates the enormity of their guilt by the word <em>refuse, </em>which intimates that they were not simply carried away by a kind of thoughtless or inconsiderate recklessness, and thus sinned through giddiness, want of knowledge or foresight, but that they had purposely, and with deliberate obstinacy, violated the holy covenant of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(320)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De la verite et fidelite des promesses, et de la foy qu’on y doit adjouster</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
