<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>And the child grew </em>From the infancy of Christ Matthew passes immediately to his manifestation. <span class="cite-ref">(230)</span> Luke relates here a single fact, which well deserved to be recorded. In the midst of his boyhood, Christ gave a specimen of his future office, or at least indicated, by a single attempt, what he would afterwards be. <em>The child grew, and was invigorated in spirit </em>These words show, that the endowments of his mind grew with his age. <span class="cite-ref">(231)</span> Hence we infer, that this progress, or advancement, relates to his human nature: for the Divine nature could receive no increase. </p><p>But a question arises. From the time that he was conceived in his mother’s womb, did he not abound in all fullness of spiritual gifts? for it appears absurd to say, that the Son of God wanted any thing that was necessary to perfection. The reply is easy. If it takes nothing from his glory, that he was altogether, “emptied,” <em>( </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσε</span><em>, </em><span class="bvs">Phi_2:6</span>,) neither does it degrade him, that he chose not only to grow in body, but to make progress in mind. And certainly when the Apostle declares, that, “in all things he was made like unto his brethren,”(<span class="bvs">Heb_2:17</span>,) and “was in all points tempted like as we are, sin excepted,” (<span class="bvs">Heb_4:15</span>,) he no doubt includes, that his soul was subject to ignorance. There is only this difference between us and him, that the weaknesses which press upon us, by a necessity which we cannot avoid, were undertaken by him voluntarily, and of his own accord. Christ received, in his human nature, according to his age and capacity, an increase of the free gifts of the Spirit, <span class="cite-ref">(232)</span> that “out of his fullness” (<span class="bvs">Joh_1:16</span>) he may pour them out upon us; for we draw grace out of his grace. </p><p>Some excessively timid persons restrict what is here said to outward appearance, and make the meaning to be, that Christ appeared to make progress, though, in point of fact, no addition was made to his knowledge. But the words have a quite different meaning, and this mistaken opinion is still more fully refuted by what Luke shortly afterwards adds, that <em>he grew in age and wisdom with God and man, </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_2:52</span>.) We are not at liberty to suppose, that knowledge lay concealed in Christ, and made its appearance in him in progress of time. There is no doubt whatever, that it was the design of God to express in plain terms, how truly and completely Christ, in taking upon him our flesh, did all that was necessary to effect his brotherly union with men. <span class="cite-ref">(233)</span></p><p>And yet we do not in this way suppose a double Christ: <span class="cite-ref">(234)</span> for, though <em>God </em>and <em>man </em>are united in one person, it does not follow, that the human nature received what was peculiar to the Divine nature: but<em>, </em>so far as was necessary for our salvation, the Son of God kept his divine power concealed. What Irenaeus says, that his Divine nature was quiescent when he suffered, <span class="cite-ref">(235)</span> I understand to refer, not only to bodily death, but to that amazing distress and agony of soul, which drew from him the complaint, “<em>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_27:46</span>.) In a word, if we do not choose to deny, that Christ was made a real man, we ought not to be ashamed to acknowledge, that he voluntarily took upon him everything that is inseparable from human nature. </p><p>It is a foolish objection, that ignorance does not apply to Christ, because it is the punishment of sin: for the same thing might be said of death. Scripture declares, on the contrary, that he performed the office of Mediator: for all the punishment which we deserved was transferred from us to him. <span class="cite-ref">(236)</span> Besides, it is a foolish mistake to say, that ignorance is the punishment of sin. For we must not suppose that Adam, while he remained in innocence, knew all things. Angels also are, to some extent, ignorant, and yet they do not endure the punishment of sin. </p><p>A more refined argument is employed by some, that there was no ignorance in Christ, because ignorance is sin. But those persons assume a principle which is altogether false and groundless: otherwise, the angels must either be equal to God, or they must be sinful. <span class="cite-ref">(237)</span> There is no doubt a sinful blindness of the human mind, which is justly reckoned a part of original sin: but here we ascribe to Christ no other ignorance than what may fall upon a man who is pure from every taint of sin. </p><p><em>He was invigorated in spirit, and was full of wisdom </em>Luke thus declares, that whatever wisdom exists among men, and receives daily accessions, flows from that single fountain, from the Spirit of God. The following phrase is more general, <em>and the grace of God was upon him: </em>for it includes all the excellence of every description that shone brightly in Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(230)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Au temps de sa manifestation</span>;” — “to the time of his manifestation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(231)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Avec l'aage les dons et graces d'Esprit croissoyent aussi et aug-mentoyent en luy</span>.” — “With age, the gifts and graces of the Spirit grew also and increased in him.”. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(232)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En dons et graces de l'Esprit</span>;” — “in gifts and graces of the Spirit.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(233)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Avoit vrayement et entierement prins tout ce qui estoit possible et propre pour accomplir de tous points la conjonction fraternelle de luy avec les hommes</span>.” — “Had truly and entirely taken all that was possible and fitted to complete, at all points, the brotherly union between him and men.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(234)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Deux Christs, ou un double Christ</span>;” — “two Christs, or a double Christ.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(235)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu'il a souffert, sa Divinite ne demonstrant point sa vertu</span>.” — “That he suffered, his Divinity not demonstrating power.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(236)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource qu'il a prins sur soy toutes les peines que nous avions meritees, afind nous en discharger</span>.” — “Because he took upon himself all the punishment which we had deserved, in order to discharge us from it." </p><p><span class="cite-note">(237)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Autrement il faudra que les Anges soyent pareils a Dieu, et qu'ils sachent tout: ou selon le dire de ces gensci, ils seront vicieux</span>.” — “Otherwise, the Angels must be equal to God, and know everything: or, according to the statement of these people, they must be sinful.” </p></div></div>
