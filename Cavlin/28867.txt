In respect of the nature of it, (the trouble,) it is plain it was external trouble. The very word there used, <span class="lang el-gr">Θλιβόμενοι</span>, signifies dashing a thing from without. As the beating and allision of the waves <em>against </em>a rock make no trouble in the rock, no commotion there, but a great deal of noise, clamor, and tumult round about it. That is the sort of trouble which that word in its primary signification holds forth to us, and which the circumstances of the text declare to be the signification of the thing here meant. [...] The word <span class="lang el-gr">στενοχωρούμενοι</span> expresseth such a kind of straitening as doth infer a difficulty of drawing breath; that a man is so compressed, that he cannot tell how to breathe. That is the native import of the word. As if he had said, ‘We are not reduced to that extremity by all the troubles that surround us, but we can breathe well enough for all that.’ Probably there are meant by this thing desired, two degrees or steps of inward trouble... Either it is a trouble that reacheth not the heart, or if it doth, it does not <em>oppress </em>or <em>overwhelm </em>it.” — <em>Howe’s Works</em>, (London, 1834), p. 706. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(468)</span> “There is an allusion,” says Dr. Bloomfield, “to an army so entirely surrounded and hemmed in <span class="lang el-gr">στενοῖς</span>, (<em>in straits</em>,) as the Roman army at the Caudinae Furc’, that there is left no hope of escape.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(469)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour le rendre contemptible</span>;” — “To render him contemptible.” </p></div></div>
