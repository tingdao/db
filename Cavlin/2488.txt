<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And he said, My presence shall go with thee </em>We gather from this answer what the desire of Moses was, for God, in accepting his prayer, affirms in one word that He will go before them as He was wont, and this was a sure pledge of His presence in no ordinary manner. For although the whole world is governed by His providence, still His face does not therein appear so conspicuously as in His protection of the Church’s welfare. And, in fact, since the same Angel, who had before presided over the camp, now undertakes the charge of guiding the people, the eternal divinity of Christ is clearly proved from hence. </p><p>This clause, “My face <span class="cite-ref">(367)</span> shall go before,” is equivalent to his saying, I will so go before thee, that thou shalt truly perceive that I am with thee, as if thou shouldst see my face set before thine eyes in a mirror. Now, since this was fulfilled in Christ, it follows that He is the eternal God, whose glory, power, and majesty is far above all creatures. The <em>rest </em>which He promises has reference to the perseverance of His grace, and its final accomplishment, <span class="cite-ref">(368)</span> as if it were said, when the people shall have entered the land, they shall be under God’s protection and guardianship; for what was common to the whole people is ascribed to the person of Moses. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(367)</span> “My presence shall go with thee.” — <em>A.V. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(368)</span> “Et au but ou Moyse pretendoit;” and to the object at which Moses aimed. — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
