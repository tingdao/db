<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Not however, etc. </em>Paul had been carried away by the ardour of his wish, as it were, into an excess of feeling, <em>( </em><em>in ecstasin </em><em>,) </em>but now, returning to discharge his office as a teacher, he adds what may be viewed as somewhat qualifying what he had said, as though he would restrain immoderate grief. And inasmuch as by deploring the ruin of his own nation, this inconsistency seems to follow, that the covenant made by God with the seed of Abraham had failed, (for the favor of God could not have been wanting to the Israelites without the covenant being abolished,) he reasonably anticipates this inconsistency, and shows, that notwithstanding the great blindness of the Jews, the favor of God continued still to that people, so that the truth of the covenant remained firm. </p><p>Some read, “But it is not possible,” etc., as though it were in Greek <span class="lang el-gr">οἷον τε </span><span class="cite-ref">(290)</span> but as I find this reading in no copy, I adopt the common reading, <em>Not however that it had failed, </em>etc., and according to this sense, “That I deplore the destruction of my nation is not because I think the promise, given formerly by God to Abraham, is now void or abolished.” </p><p><em>For not all, etc. </em>The statement is, — that the promise was so given to Abraham and to his seed, that the inheritance did not belong to every seed without distinction; it hence follows that the defection of some does not prove that the covenant does not remain firm and valid. </p><p>But that it may be more evident on what condition the Lord adopted the posterity of Abraham as a peculiar people to himself, two things are to be here considered. The first is, That the promise of salvation given to Abraham belongs to all who can trace their natural descent to him; for it is offered to all without exception, and for this reason they are rightly called the heirs of the covenant made with Abraham; and in this respect they are his successors, or, as Scripture calls them, the children of the promise. For since it was the Lord’s will that his covenant should be sealed, no less in Ishmael and Esau, than in Isaac and Jacob, it appears that they were not wholly alienated from him; except, it may be, you make no account of the circumcision, which was conferred on them by God’s command; but it cannot be so regarded without dishonor to God. But this belonged to them, according to what the Apostle had said before, “whose are the covenants,” though they were unbelieving; and in <span class="bvs">Act_3:25</span>, they are called by Peter, the children of the covenants, because they were the descendants of the Prophets. The second point to be considered is, That the children of the promise are strictly those in whom its power and effect are found. On this account Paul denies here that all the children of Abraham were the children of God, though a covenant had been made with them by the Lord, for few continued in the faith of the covenant; and yet God himself testifies, in <span class="bvs">Eze_6:9</span>, that they were all regarded by him as children. In short, when a whole people are called the heritage and the peculiar people of God, what is meant is, that they have been chosen by the Lord, the promise of salvation having been offered them and confirmed by the symbol of circumcision; but as many by their ingratitude reject this adoption, and thus enjoy in no degree its benefits, there arises among them another difference with regard to the fulfilment of the promise. That it might not then appear strange to any one, that this fulfilment of the promise was not evident in many of the Jews, Paul denies that they were included in the true election of God. </p><p>Some may prefer such a statement as this, — “The general election of the people of Israel is no hinderance, that God should not from them choose by his hidden counsel those whom he pleases.” It is indeed an illustrious example of gratuitous mercy, when God deigns to make a covenant of life with a nation: but his hidden favor appears more evident in that second election, which is confined to a part only. </p><p>But when he says, that <em>all who are of Israel are not Israelites, </em>and that <em>all who are of the seed of Abraham are not children, </em>it is a kind of change in the meaning of words, (<span class="lang el-gr">παρονομασία</span>); for in the first clause he includes the whole race, in the second he refers only to true sons, who were not become degenerated. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(290)</span> Were this the case, the verb which follows, as [<span class="bvs">Wolfius </span>] says and proves by an example, must have been in the infinitive mood. [<span class="bvs">Piscator </span>] says the same. But [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] take this to be the meaning; and so does [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] <em>, </em>“Now it is not possible that the promise of God hath fallen.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
