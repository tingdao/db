<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here extends his discourse still farther; for he promises not only the complete restoration of his chosen people, but also the propagation of the Church; for God, he says, will gather a Church for himself from many and remote nations, and unite many nations in one body. And this ought to have availed especially to animate the Jews, as they were thus taught that the temple was built, not only that God might be worshipped by one nation, but by all nations. Moreover, as before this time some had come from distant lands to worship God, the Prophet may seem here to have this in view by using <span class="lang he-il">עוד</span>, <em>oud</em>, the adverb of time. <span class="cite-ref">(91)</span> But he not only declares that some would come, as in the time of Solomon, but as I have already said, he promises here something more remarkable — that the temple would not belong peculiarly to the Jews, but would be common to all nations; for there is to be no language and no nation which is not to unite in the true worship of God. But let us consider the words of the Prophet. </p><p>He begins by saying, that God was the author of this prophecy; and this was said to secure credit. There was need, as we have said, of no common authority, since he was here speaking of what was incredible. There was only a handful of people returned to their country, and many dangers surrounded them almost every day; so that many, wearied with their present condition, preferred exile, and regret for their return had now crept into the minds of many, for they thought that they had been deceived. Since then the state of the people was such, there was need of something more than ordinary to confirm what is here said — that the glory of the second temple would be greater and more eminent than that of the first: <em>It shall yet be</em>, he says. Though a comparison is implied, there is yet no equality expressed, as though some few only would come. But as there had been no temple for seventy years, and as the temple, now begun to be built, was in no high esteem, but mean and insignificant, the Prophet says, that the time would yet come, when <em>nations and inhabitants of great cities </em>would <em>ascend into Jerusalem</em>. We may indeed render <span class="lang he-il">רבות</span>, <em>rebut</em>, many or great, for it means both; but the Prophet, I think, speaks of great cities; and the reason will presently appear. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(91)</span> There is a difficulty in the construction here. The best solution is that of our version, followed by <em>Grotius</em>, <em>Newcome</em>, and others; there is understood the auxiliary verb, “it shall be:” so the rendering would be, </p><p><em>Yet </em>it shall be<em>that come shall people </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And the inhabitants of many cities. </em></p><p>There is a similar instance in verse 23, where the auxiliary verb is to be understood, and [<span class="lang he-il">אשר</span> ] must be rendered <em>that</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
