<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_26:31</span><strong>.</strong><em>You will all be offended at me. </em>What Matthew and Mark extend to all the disciples alike is related by Luke as having been spoken to Peter only. But though the statement was equally addressed to all, yet it is probable that Christ spoke to them in the person of one man, who was to be admonished more than all the rest, and who needed extraordinary consolation, that, after having denied Christ, he might not be altogether overwhelmed with despair. </p></div>
