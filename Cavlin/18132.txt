<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>In that day shall a song be sung. </em>Here the Prophet begins again to shew that, after the return of the people from captivity, they will be defended by God’s power and guardianship, and that under his protection Jerusalem will be as safe as if she had been surrounded by bulwarks, ramparts, a ditch, and a double wall, so that no enemy could find entrance. </p><p>It is proper to observe the time when “this song was sung.” The Prophet had foretold the calamity that would befall the Church, which was not yet so near at hand, but happened a short time after his death. When the people were led into captivity, they would undoubtedly have despaired, if they had not been encouraged by such promises. That the Jews might cherish a hope that they would be delivered, and might behold life in the midst of death, the Prophet composed for them this song, even before the calamity occurred, that they might be better prepared for enduring it, and might hope for better things. I do not think that it was composed solely that, when they had been delivered, they might give thanks to God, but that even during their captivity, though they were like dead men, (<span class="bvs">Eze_37:1</span>,) they might strengthen their hearts with this confidence, and might also train up their children in this expectation, and hand down these promises, as it were, to posterity. </p><p>We have formerly <span class="cite-ref">(154)</span> seen the reason why these and other promises were put by Isaiah into the form of verse. It was, that, having been frequently sung, they might make a deeper impression on their memory. Though they mourned in Babylon, and were almost overwhelmed with sorrow, (hence these sounds, (<span class="bvs">Psa_137:4</span>,) “How can we sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land?”) yet they must have hoped that at a future period, when they should have returned to Judea, they would give thanks to the Lord and sing his praises; and therefore the Prophet shews to them at a distance the day of deliverance, that they may take courage from the expectation of it. </p><p><em>We have a city of strength. </em>By these words a full restoration of Jerusalem and of the people is promised, because God will not only deliver the captives and gather those that are scattered, but will also preserve them safe, after having brought them back to their country. But not long afterwards believers saw that Jerusalem was destroyed, (<span class="bvs">2Kg_25:9</span>,) and the Temple thrown down, (<span class="bvs">2Ch_36:19</span>,) and after their return nothing could meet their eye but hideous ruins; and all this Isaiah had previously foretold. It was therefore necessary that they should behold from the lofty watch-tower of faith this restoration of Jerusalem. </p><p><em>He hath made salvation to be walls and a bulwark. </em>He now defines what will be “the strength of the city;” for the “salvation” of God will supply the place of a “wall,” towers, ditches, and mounds. As if he had said, “Let other cities rely on their fortifications, God alone will be to us instead of all bulwarks.” Some allege that the words may be read, “He hath set a wall and bulwark for salvation;” and I do not set aside that rendering. But as a more valuable doctrine is contained in the Prophet’s words, when nothing is supplied, it serves no good purpose to go far for a forced interpretation; especially since the true and natural interpretation readily presents itself to the mind, which is, that God’s protection is more valuable than all ditches and walls. In like manner, it is also said in the psalm, “Thy mercy is better than life,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_63:3</span>;) for as David there boasts of enjoying, under God’s shadow, greater safety and freedom from care than if he had been fortified by every kind of earthly defense, so Isaiah here says, that there will be good reason for laying aside fear, when God shall have undertaken to guard his people. Now, since this promise extends to the whole course of redemption, we ought to believe that at the present day God is still the guardian of his Church, and therefore, that his power is of more avail than if it had been defended by every kind of military force. Accordingly, if we wish to dwell in safety, we must remain in the Church. Though we have no outward defences, yet let us learn to be satisfied with the Lord’s protection, and with his sure salvation, which is better than all bulwarks. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(154)</span> See vol. 1 p. 162. </p><p><span class="cite-ref">FT412</span> See Calvin on Isaiah, vol. 1 p. 384 </p><p><span class="cite-ref">FT413</span> “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace (Heb. peace, peace) whose mind (or, thought, or, imagination) is stayed on thee.” — Eng.

The first gives the word the usual sense of <span class="lang he-il">איר</span>, (ō<em>r</em>,) <em>light</em>; the other, that of <em>plants</em>, which it has in <span class="bvs">2Kg_4:39</span>. To the former it may be objected, that it leaves the plural form unexplained, that it arbitrarily makes <em>light </em>mean <em>life</em>, and that it departs from the acknowledged meaning of <span class="lang he-il">ארות</span> (ō<em>rōth</em>) in the only other place where it occurs. The second interpretation, on the other hand, assumes but one sense of the word, allows the plural form its proper force, and supposes an obvious and natural allusion to the influence of dew upon the growth of plants. In either case, the reference to the dew is intended to illustrate the vivifying power of God.” — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-ref">FT443</span> As to the interpretation of <span class="lang he-il">רפאים</span> (<em>rĕphāīm</em>) by <em>giants</em>, See page 231, note 3 </p><p><span class="cite-ref">FT444</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que ces tourbillons et orages passent, et sont de petite duree</span>;” — “That these whirlwinds and storms pass away, and are of short duration.” </p><p><span class="cite-ref">FT445</span> “Her blood (Heb. bloods).” — Eng.
