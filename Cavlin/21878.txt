<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet uses the word “<em>golden, </em>” probably, because the most precious vessels were brought; silver might also have been added, but the more splendid ones are noticed. He does not say that Nebuchadnezzar carried them off, but implies it to be the common act of all the Babylonians. They obtained the victory under the direction of this king, hence he used the spoils; and since they were all engaged in the victory, the Prophet speaks of them all. In using the phrase, “the temple,” he <em>expresses </em>more than before, by saying, not from Jerusalem only but from the temple of God’s house. </p></div>
