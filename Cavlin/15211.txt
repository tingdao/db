<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>Why then hast thou broken down its hedges? </em>This is the application of the similitude; for nothing seems more inconsistent than that God should abandon the vine which he had planted with his own hand, to be rooted up by wild beasts. It is true that he often threatened and forewarned the people by his prophets that he would do this; but what constrained him to inflict upon them so strange and dreadful a species of punishment was, that he might render their ingratitude the more detestable. At the same time, it is not without reason that true believers are enjoined to take encouragement from such distinguished liberality on the part of God; that, even in the midst of this rooting up, they might at least hope that He, who never forsakes the work of his own hands, would graciously extend his care towards them, (<span class="bvs">Psa_138:8</span>.) The people were brought to desolation, on account of their own incurable obstinacy; but God did not fail to save a small number of shoots, by means of which he afterwards restored his vine. This form of supplicating pardon was, indeed, set forth for the use of the whole people, with the view of preventing a horrible destruction. But as very few sought to appease the wrath of God by truly humbling themselves before him, it was enough that these few were delivered from destruction, that from them a new vine might afterwards spring up and flourish. The indignity which was done to the Church is aggravated from the contrast contained in the words, when God, on the one hand, is exhibited to us as a vine-keeper, and when the destroyers of this vine, on the other, are represented to be not only all that pass by, but also the wild boars and other savage beasts. The word <span class="lang he-il">כרסם</span>, <em>kiresem, </em>which I have translated <em>to waste, </em>is taken by some for <em>to fill the belly. </em><span class="cite-ref">(394)</span> This sense would very well agree with the present passage; but it is not supported by the ordinary meaning of the word. </p><p><strong>(394)</strong> “<span class="lang he-il">יכרסמנה</span>, (<em>jechar-semenna</em>,)<em>will destroy it Targum</em>, <em>Will tear it up with its tusk Fut pih </em>From <span class="lang he-il">חרסם</span>, <em>he cut off</em>, <em>cut down</em>, <em>consumed</em>, a quadriliteral, same as the Chaldaic <span class="lang he-il">קוסם</span>. Occurs here only in Scripture, and, according to others, is compounded of <span class="lang he-il">כרש</span>,<em>a belly</em>, as though <span class="lang he-il">וכרש</span>, <em>will fill the belly from it</em>. ” — <em>Bythner </em></p></div>
