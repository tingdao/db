<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And now, behold, I go unto my people. </em>Since the counsel which he gave is not here expressly mentioned, <span class="cite-ref">(174)</span> it is the opinion of some that his address is unfinished, and they suppose that he referred to the cunning advice so destructive to the people, which will be presently related; <em>i.e., </em>that the Moabitish women should prostitute themselves. Others rather imagine that Balaam counselled Balak to rest quiet, since the prosperity of the Israelites would do no harm to the Moabites in his lifetime. I, however, take it simply for to teach, or to admonish what would be for his advantage. Thus he commends his prophecy, in order that Balaam may willingly submit to it. Still, when he speaks of the “latter days,” he signifies that there was no cause for Balak himself to fear or be anxious; since the punishment of his nation would be deferred for a long time. In the meantime we see what Balak had gained by his trouble; for, whereas he had hitherto only heard the people of Israel blessed, he is not compelled to listen to what is more painful still, viz., the ruin of his own nation. This is the reward of those who strive against God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(174)</span> C. translates <span class="lang he-il">איעצך</span>, which<em>A.
