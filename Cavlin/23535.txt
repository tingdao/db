<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>45.</strong><em>He taketh with him seven other spirits </em>The number <em>seven </em>is here used indefinitely, as in many other passages. By these words Christ shows that if we fall from his grace, our subjection to Satan is doubled, so that he treats us with greater cruelty than before, and that this is the just punishment of our slothfulness. <span class="cite-ref">(149)</span> Let us not then suppose that the devil has been vanquished by a single combat, because he has once gone out of us. On the contrary, let us remember that, as his lodgment within us was of old standing, ever since we were born, he has knowledge and experience of all the approaches by which he may reach us; and that, if there be no open and direct entrance, he has dexterity enough to creep in by small holes or winding crevices. <span class="cite-ref">(150)</span> We must, therefore, endeavor that Christ, holding his reign within us, may block up all the entrances of his adversary. Whatever may be the fierceness or violence of Satan’s attacks, they ought not to intimidate the sons of God, whom the invincible power of the Holy Spirit preserves in safety. We know that the punishment which is here threatened is addressed to none but those who despise the grace of God, and who, by extinguishing the light of faith, and banishing the desire of godliness, <span class="cite-ref">(151)</span> become profane. </p><p><strong>(149)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En sorte qu’il nous tient le pied sur la gorge plus estroitement que devant: et qu’en cela nous recevons une iuste recompense et punition de nostre nonchalance</span>;” — “so that he holds his foot upon our throat more straitly than before; and that in this we have a just reward of our indifference.” </p><p><strong>(150)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et s’il n’y pent entrer de front et apertement, il est assez fin pour s’y fourrer secretement par dessous terre, ou par quelque fente a coste</span>;”— “and if he cannot enter it in front and openly, he is cunning enough to dig into it secretly below ground, or by some chink in the side.” </p><p><strong>(151)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et effacans l’amour de la crainte de Dieu</span>;” — “and effacing the love of the fear of God.” </p></div>
