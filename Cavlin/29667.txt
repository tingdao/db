<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>. And now what withholdeth </em><span class="lang el-gr">Τὸ κατέχον</span> means here properly an impediment or occasion of delay. Chrysostom, who thinks that this can only be understood as referring to the Spirit, or to the Roman Empire, prefers to lean to the latter opinion. He assigns a plausible reason — because Paul would not have spoken of the Spirit in enigmatical terms, <span class="cite-ref">(655)</span> but in speaking of the Roman Empire wished to avoid exciting unpleasant feeling. He states also the reason why the state of the Roman Empire retards the revelation of Antichrist — that, as the monarchy of Babylon was overthrown by the Persians and Medes, and the Macedonians, having conquered the Persians, again took possession of the monarchy, and the Macedonians were at last subdued by the Romans, so Antichrist seized hold for himself of the vacant supremacy of the Roman Empire. There is not one of these things that was not afterwards confirmed by actual occurrence. Chrysostom, therefore, speaks truly in so far as concerns history. I am of opinion, however, that Paul’s intention was different from this — that the doctrine of the gospel would require to be spread hither and thither, until nearly the whole world were convicted of obstinacy and deliberate malice. For there can be no doubt that the Thessalonians had heard from Paul’s mouth as to this impediment, of whatever sort it was, for he recalls to their remembrance what he had previously taught in their presence. </p><p>Let my readers now consider which of the two is the more probable — either that Paul declared that the light of the gospel must be diffused through all parts of the earth before God would thus give loose reins to Satan, or that the power of the Roman Empire stood in the way of the rise of Antichrist, inasmuch as he could only break through into a vacant possession. I seem at least to hear Paul discoursing as to the universal call of the Gentiles — that the grace of God must be offered to all — that Christ must enlighten the whole world by his gospel, in order that the impiety of men might be the more fully attested and demonstrated. This, therefore, was the delay, until the career of the gospel should be completed, because a gracious invitation to salvation was first in order. <span class="cite-ref">(656)</span> Hence he adds, <em>in his time</em>, because vengeance was ripe after grace had been rejected. <span class="cite-ref">(657)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(655)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En termes couuerts ou obscurs</span>;” — “In hidden or obscure terms.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(656)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’autant que l’ordre que Dieu vouloit tenir, requeroit que le monde premierement fust d’vne liberalite gratuite conuié a salut</span>;” — “Inasmuch as the order that God designed to maintain, required that the world should first of all be invited to salvation by a gracious liberality.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(657)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La droite saison de la vengeance estoit apres la grace reiette</span>;” — “The right season of vengeance was after grace had been rejected.” </p></div></div>
