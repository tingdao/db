<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>79.</strong><em>That he might give light to those who were sitting in darkness </em>As to <em>light </em>and <em>darkness, </em>there are similar modes of expression in Isaiah: such as, </p><p>“The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_9:1</span>;) </p><p>and in many other passages. These words show, that out of Christ there is no life-giving light in the world, but every thing is covered by the appalling darkness of death. Thus, in another passage, Isaiah testifies that this privilege belongs peculiarly to the church alone. </p><p>“Behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_60:2</span>.) </p><p>But how could it be said that the Israelites, on whose hearts the Lord always shone by faith, <em>were sitting in the shadow of death? </em>I reply, the godly, who lived under the law were surrounded on every side by the darkness of death, and beheld at a distance, in the coming of Christ, the light that cheered and preserved them from being overwhelmed by present death. Zacharias may have had in view the wretched condition of his own age. But it is a general truth, that on all the godly, who had ever lived, or who were afterwards to live, there arose in the coming of Christ a light to impart life: for it even diffused life over the dead. To <em>sit </em>is of the same import as to <em>lie: </em><span class="cite-ref">(84)</span> and so Isaiah enjoins the Church, “Arise, for thy light is come,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_60:1</span>.) </p><p><em>To guide our feet </em>By this expression Zacharias points out, that the highest perfection of all excellence and happiness is to be found in Christ alone. The word <em>Peace </em>might indeed be taken in its literal sense, which would not be unsuitable: for the illumination brought by Christ tends to pacify the minds of men. But as the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שלום</span>, <em>peace, </em>denotes every kind of prosperity, Zacharias intended, I doubt not, to represent Christ as the author of perfect blessedness, that we may not seek the smallest portion of happiness elsewhere, but may rest on Christ alone, from a full conviction that in him we are entirely and completely happy. To this purpose are those words of Isaiah, </p><p>“The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_60:19</span>.) </p><p>But if the mere sight of his Son, while still a child, led Zacharias to discourse in so lofty a strain respecting the grace and power of Christ, before he was born, are not they so much the more ungrateful, who, now that Christ has died, and risen, and ascended to heaven, and sat down at his Father’s right hand, speak disrespectfully of him and of his power, to which the Holy Spirit bore testimony, while he was still in his mother’s womb? We must bear in mind what I have already mentioned, that Zacharias spake not from himself, but that the Spirit of God directed his tongue. </p><p><em>And the child grew </em>This is added by Luke for continuing the thread of the history. <em>First, </em>he mentions that John <em>became strong in spirit: </em>which implies that the great and uncommon excellence of the child gave proof that there dwelt in him a Heavenly Spirit. Next, he tells us, that John remained unknown in the deserts <em>till the day of his showing, </em>that is, till the day on which the Lord had pur-posed to bring him into public view. Hence we conclude, that John, though he was fully aware of his calling, made no advances before the appointed time, but awaited the call of God. </p><p><strong>(84)</strong><em>“ </em><em class="lang fr-fr">Estre assis </em><span class="lang fr-fr">emporte autant comme estre couch, ou veautre</span>.”— “To <em>sit </em>is of the same import as to be lying or wallowing.” </p></div>
