<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>We have much grace and consolation. </em>Although this reading is found in the majority of Greek copies, yet I think that it ought to be translated <em>joy</em>; for, since there is little difference between<span class="lang el-gr">χάριν </span> and χαράν, it would be easy to mistake a single letter. Besides, Paul elsewhere employs the word<span class="lang el-gr">χάριν </span> to mean “joy;” at least, if we believe Chrysostom on this matter. What has “grace” to do with “consolation?” </p><p><em>For thy love. </em>It is plain enough what he means, that he has great joy and consolation, because Philemon administered relief to the necessities of the godly. This was singular love, to feel so much joy on account of the benefit received by others. Besides, the Apostle does not only speak of his personal joy, but says that many rejoiced on account of the kindness and benevolence with which Philemon had aided religious men. </p><p><em>Because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother. </em>“To refresh the bowels” is an expression used by Paul to mean, to give relief from distresses, or to aid the wretched in such a manner that, having their minds composed, and being free from all uneasiness and grief, they may find repose. “The bowels” mean the affections, and<span class="lang el-gr">ἀνάπαυσις </span> denotes tranquillity; and therefore they are greatly mistaken who torture this passage so as to make it refer to the belly and the nourishment of the body. </p></div>
