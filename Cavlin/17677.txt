<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water </em>Isaiah speaks metaphorically, and by two comparisons shows here, that though the outward appearance of affairs was not openly overturned, yet their condition was changed and corrupted, so as to be widely different from what it had formerly been: for he says that <em>dross </em>now shines instead of <em>gold</em>, and that the <em>wine</em>, though it retains its color, has lost its flavour. “Though thou still make an empty show,” saith the Prophet, “yet nothing <em>pure </em>will be found in thee: that <em>wine </em>which was wont to be Stare in thee is corrupted; and though its color deceive the eye, its taste shows that it has been <em>mixed</em>. ” </p><p>All this means nothing more than that the Jews should lay aside hypocrisy, and should begin to confess their sins, and no longer flatter themselves after the manner of hypocrites. The comparisons here employed are exceedingly well adapted to this end, for <em>dross </em>bears some resemblance to <em>gold</em>; and in like manner, the color of <em>wine mixed with water </em>resembles that of pure wine; and yet both are very far from having that purity of which they make an outward show. In like manner hypocrites, by their hypocrisy, may be said to assume a false color of <em>silver</em>, though they are of no more value than dross, and indeed are the more detestable on this account, that, though they are exceedingly wicked, yet, with not less treachery than baseness, they present to God and to men those hollow pretensions by which they cloak their malice. </p></div>
