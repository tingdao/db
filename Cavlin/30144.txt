<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And every priest, etc. </em>Here is the conclusion of the whole argument, — that the practice of daily sacrificing is inconsistent with and wholly foreign to the priesthood of Christ; and that hence after his coming the Levitical priests whose custom and settled practice was daily to offer, were deposed from their office; for the character of things which are contrary is, that when one thing is set up, the other falls to the ground. He has hitherto labored enough, and more than enough, in defending the priesthood of Christ; the conclusion then is, that the ancient priesthood, which is inconsistent with this, has ceased; for all the saints find a full consecration in the one offering of Christ. At the same time the word<span class="lang el-gr">τετελείωκεν, </span> which I render “has consecrated,” may yet be rendered “has perfected;” but I prefer the former meaning, because he treats here of sacred things. <span class="cite-ref">(167)</span></p><p>By saying, <em>them who are sanctified, </em>he includes all the children of God; and he reminds us that the grace of sanctification is sought elsewhere in vain. </p><p>But lest men should imagine that Christ is now idle in heaven, he repeats again that he <em>sat down at God’s right hand; </em>by which phrase is denoted, as we have seen elsewhere, his dominion and power. There is therefore no reason for us to fear, that he will suffer the efficacy of his death to be destroyed or to lie buried; for he lives for this end, that by his power he may fill heaven and earth. He then reminds us in the words of the Psalm how long this state of things is to be, even until Christ shall lay prostrate all his enemies. If then our faith seeks Christ sitting on God’s right hand, and recumbs quietly on him as there sitting, we shall at length enjoy the fruit of his victory; yea, when our foes, Satan, sin, death, and the whole world are vanquished, and when corruption of our flesh is cast off, we shall triumph for ever together with our head. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(167)</span> See Appendix K 2. </p></div></div>
