So he created the world in six days, (<span class="bvs">Gen_1:0</span>.) not because he had any need of space of thee, but that he might the better stay us in the meditating upon his works, (<span class="bvs">Exo_20:11</span>,) for he applieth the manner of doing unto our capacity, and unto the increase of faith. If Peter had at a sudden been carried unto the house where the brethren were assembled, then should one only deliverance have been acknowledged, but now we see, as it were with our eyes, that he was delivered more than ten times. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(758)</span> “Momento uno,” in one moment. </p></div></div>
