<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. </em>It might also be read, <em>In the glory</em>, because the particle <span class="lang el-gr">εἰς</span> (to) is often used in place of <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν</span> (<em>in</em>.) I prefer, however, to retain its proper signification, as meaning, that as the majesty of God has been manifested to men through Christ, so it shines forth in Christ, and the Father is glorified in the Son. See <span class="bvs">Joh_5:17</span>, and you will find an exposition of this passage. </p></div>
