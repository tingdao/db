<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>69.</strong><em>And built his sanctuary like high places. </em><span class="cite-ref">(368)</span> In this verse, what is intimated is simply this, that Mount Zion was singularly beautified; which, however, ought to be referred to the heavenly pattern. It was not the will of God that the minds of his people should be entirely engrossed with the magnificence of the building, or with the pomp of outward ceremonies; but that they should be elevated to Christ, in whom the truth of the figures of the former economy was exhibited. It is, therefore affirmed, that <em>the sanctuary was built like high places; </em>that is to say, it was conspicuous among all the high mountains: even as Isaiah (<span class="bvs">Isa_2:2</span>,) and Micah, (<span class="bvs">Mic_4:1</span>,) prophesying of the building of the new and spiritual temple, declare that it “shall be established in the tops of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills.” And it is well known that fortresses were in those days erected upon high places. Zion is next compared to the entire mass of the globe: <em>He hath built his sanctuary like the earth, </em><span class="cite-ref">(369)</span><em>which he has established for ever. </em>Some regions of the globe are visited by earthquakes, or perish by the opening of the earth, or are agitated by some violent commotion, or undergo some alteration; but the body of the earth itself continues always stable and unchanged, because it rests upon deep foundations. It is, therefore, here taught that the building spoken of was not temporary, like the sumptuous palaces of kings, which fall into ruins during the lapse of time, or are in danger of being destroyed by other means; but that it was founded to stand entire, even to the end of the world. If it is objected that the temple was destroyed by the Chaldeans and Assyrians, the answer is obvious, That the stability celebrated consists in Christ alone; for, if the ancient sanctuary, which was only a figure, is considered merely in itself, without any regard to that which it typified, it will be only an empty shadow. But as God intended it to be a pledge to show that Christ was to come, perpetuity is justly attributed to it. In like manner it is said, in another place, (<span class="bvs">Psa_87:1</span>,) “His foundation is in the holy mountains;” and in Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_14:32</span>,) “The Lord hath founded Zion;” and again, in <span class="bvs">Psa_74:2</span>, God is said “to dwell in mount Zion,” so that it should never be moved. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(368)</span> In our English Bible it is, “And he built his sanctuary like high palaces.” On which Archbishop Secker has the following note: — “That God <em>built his tabernacle like high palaces</em>, is not a strong expression. <em>On high</em>, which Hare adopts, is better. And perhaps changing <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>, into <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, would suffice for this sense. But the old versions have <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>, and yet in the latter part of the verse they have <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, for <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>. It is a remarkable anticipation to mention the temple, which Solomon built, before the mention of David.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(369)</span> “<em>Like the earth</em>; the simile is intended to point out the fixedness of the <em>temple</em>, in opposition to the frequent <em>different </em>stations in which the tabernacle had been placed.” — <em>Warner</em>. </p></div></div>
