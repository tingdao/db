<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>And Agrippa said unto Paul. </em>The apostle prevailed thus far at least, that he wrung out of king Agrippa a confession, though it were not voluntary, as those use to yield who can no longer resist the truth, or, at least, to show some token of assent. Agrippa’s meaning is, that he will not willingly become a Christian; yea, that he will not be one at all; and yet that he is not able to gainsay, but that he is drawn after a sort against his will. Whereby it appeareth how great the pride of man’s nature is until it be brought under to obey by the Spirit of God.</p><p>Interpreters expound this, <span class="lang el-gr">εν ολιγω</span> diversely. Valla thought that it ought to be translated thus, Thou dost almost make me a Christian. Erasmus doth translate it <em>a little. </em>The old interpreter dealeth more plainly<span class="cite-ref">(629)</span><em>in a little; </em>because, translating it word for word, he left it to the readers to judge at their pleasure. And surely it may be fitly referred unto the time, as if Agrippa had said, Thou wilt make me a Christian straightway, or in one moment. If any man object that Paul’s answer doth not agree thereto, we may quickly answer; for seeing the speech was doubtful, Paul doth fitly apply that unto the thing which was spoken of the time. Therefore, seeing Agrippa did mean that he was almost made a Christian in a small time, Paul addeth that he doth desire that as well he as his companions might rise from small beginnings, and profit more and more; and yet I do not mislike that that <span class="lang el-gr">εν ολιγω</span> doth signify as much as almost. This answer doth testify with what zeal, to spread abroad the glory of Christ, this holy man’s breast was inflamed, when as he doth patiently suffer those bonds wherewith the governor had bound him, and doth desire that he might escape the deadly snares of Satan, and to have both him and also his partners to be partakers with him of the same grace, being in the mean season content with his troublesome and reproachful condition. We must note that he doth not wish it simply, but from God, as it is he which draweth us unto his Son; because, unless he teach us inwardly by his Spirit, the outward doctrine shall always wax cold.</p><p><em>Except these bonds. </em>It is certain that Paul’s bonds were not so hard, ne [nor] yet did they cause him such sorrow, wherein he did oftentimes rejoice, and which he doth mention for honor’s sake, as being the badge of his embassage, ( <span class="bvs">Gal_6:17</span>), but he hath respect to those to whom he wisheth faith without trouble or cross. For those who did not as yet believe in Christ were far from that affection to be ready to strive for the gospel. And surely it behoveth all the godly to have this gentleness and meekness, that they patiently bear their own cross, and that they wish well to others, and study so much as in them lieth to ease them of all trouble, and that they do in no case envy their quietness and mirth. This courtesy<span class="cite-ref">(630)</span> is far contrary to the bitterness of those who take comfort in wishing that other men were in their misery.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(629)</span></p><p>“ Simplicius,” more simply. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(630)</span></p><p>“ Humanitas et moderatio,” humanity and moderation. </p></div></div>
