<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>And the Lord spoke unto Moses. </em><span class="cite-ref">(63)</span> I have translated the <em>copula </em>by the word <em>itaque </em>(therefore,) to indicate the connection with what precedes: for Moses does not here recount anything new, but, by way of explanation, repeats a point of great importance, viz., that they, who had refused to enter the land, would be deprived of <em>its </em>possession. He begins with the passionate interrogation: <span class="cite-ref">(64)</span> “How long shall this troublesome dregs of a people be borne with, who never cease to murmur against me?” And God says that He “had heard” their turbulent cries; in order that they might more certainly perceive that their pride was intolerable, since God Himself was weary of it, although He is long-suffering and slow to anger. It is in bitter irony that He says He will deal with them in accordance with their own resolution and desire. Nothing, indeed, was further from their intention than to wander in the wilderness, but, since they had held back from entering the land, God says that He will gratify them in a very different sense, viz., that they shall never enjoy the sight of that land, which they had despised. By His oath, He expresses His extreme wrath, as also it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_95:11</span>, </p><p>“Unto whom I swore in my wrath, that they<LineBreak />shall not enter into my rest.” <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span></p><p>It was necessary that their stolidity should be thus aroused, lest, when God was so greatly provoked, they should still continue self-satisfied, according to their went. He aggravates their punishment by another circumstance, <em>i.e., </em>that, they were to be deprived of the inheritance which He had sworn to give to Abraham; for the lifting up of the hand <span class="cite-ref">(66)</span> (as I have said elsewhere) was a form of oath; just as if God were called down from heaven by the outstretched hand to be witness and judge: and, although this does not indeed literally apply to God, still we know that He commonly transfers to Himself the things that belong to men. Moreover, this was a most severe reproof, that they by their wickedness and self-will should nullify a promise, which God had ratified by an oath, in so far, at least, as its fulfillment affected themselves: for He points out immediately afterwards that, although they had rejected the proffered blessing, he would still be true; and would bestow on their little ones that which they had refused for themselves. It is thus that God tempers His judgments against those hypocrites, who falsely profess to honor His name, so as to preserve a seed for the propagation of His Church: nor is He ever so severe towards the reprobate, as to fail in sustaining His mercy towards His elect. Nay, He here declares that Hie will be gracious towards their children, as a means of inflicting punishment on the fathers. It was an indirect accusation of God, when they lamented over their children, as if they were to be carried away as “a prey;” whereas, God promises that they shall be the possessors of the land, in order to reprove this wicked blasphemy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(63)</span> “The Lord spoke <em>therefore </em>to Moses,” <em>etc. </em>—<em>Lat. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(64)</span> “Pathetica interrogatio.” —<em>Lat. </em>“Or, Dieu use d’un proeme vehement a la facon d’un homme passione;” now, God uses a vehement exordium, after the fashion of an angry man. — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(65)</span> “Si introibunt in requiem meam.” —<em>Lat. </em>See <em>Margin A.V., </em>and <span class="bvs">Heb_4:3</span>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(66)</span> See <span class="bvs">Num_14:30</span>, <em>Margin A.V.Item, </em>vol. 1, p. 131, on <span class="bvs">Exo_6:8</span>. </p></div></div>
