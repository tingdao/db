<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>But that the world may know. </em>Some think that these words should be read as closely connected with the words, <em>Arise</em>, <em>let us go hence</em>, so as to make the sense complete. Others read the former part of the verse separately, and suppose that it breaks off abruptly. As it makes no great difference in regard to the meaning, I leave it to the reader to give a preference to either of these views. What chiefly deserves our attention is, that the decree of God is here placed in the highest rank; that we may not suppose that Christ was dragged to death by the violence of Satan, in such a manner that anything happened contrary to the purpose of God. It was God who appointed his Son to be the Propitiation, and who determined that the sins of the world should be expiated by his death. In order to accomplish this, he permitted Satan, for a short time, to treat him with scorn; as if he had gained a victory over him. Christ, therefore, does not resist Satan, in order that he may obey the decree of his Father, and may thus offer his obedience as the ransom of our righteousness. </p><p><em>Arise, let us go hence. </em>Some think that Christ, after he said these things, changed his place, and that what follows was spoken by him on the road; but as John afterwards adds, that Christ went away with his disciples beyond the brook Kedron, <span class="cite-ref">(75)</span> it appears more probable that Christ intended to exhort the disciples to render the same obedience to God, of which they beheld in him so illustrious an example, and not that he led them away at that moment. </p><p><strong>(75)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Christ s’en alla avec ses disciples outre le torrent de Cedron</span>.” </p></div>
