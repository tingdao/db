<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And there shall be a path. </em><span class="cite-ref">(192)</span> This verse contains nothing new, but explains the former verse. The people would perceive the same power of God in the deliverance from Babylon as they had perceived in the deliverance from Egypt. He had opened up a way through seas, (<span class="bvs">Exo_14:29</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_77:19</span>,) through untrodden deserts, (<span class="bvs">Deu_8:2</span>,) and through Jordan; (<span class="bvs">Jos_3:16</span>.) In like manner, Isaiah says, that by an unexpected and astonishing method he will again open up a way for his people to go out. Accordingly, what the Lord has once performed let us also expect for the future; and for that purpose let us ponder the ancient histories. This ought also to direct our thoughts to the final deliverance of the Church, by which we shall all be delivered from all troubles and distresses; so that, though what we are told about a resurrection and immortal life may appear to be incredible, and the means of accomplishing them are not seen by us, still the Lord will easily find a way. </p><p><strong>(192)</strong><em>An highway</em>. â€” Eng.
