<div class="comment-content"><p>We now then understand the full meaning of the Prophet; and hence he says, <em>They shall emigrate at the head of the emigrants, </em>that is, “when there shall be an emigration, they shall be the first in order of time. I have hitherto indulgently spared you; but as I see that you have abused my forbearance, ye shall certainly be the forerunners of others; for ye shall go first into captivity. And my rigor shall begin with you, because I see that I have hitherto lost all my labor in attempting, kindly and paternally to call you to repentance. <em>Ye shall </em>now then<em>migrate at the head of the emigrants </em></p><p><em>And come shall the mourning of those who extend themselves, </em><span class="lang he-il">סרוחים</span>, <em>saruchim </em><span class="cite-ref">(43)</span>; that is, “Ye indeed lie down, (as he had said before,) ye extend yourselves on your couches; but mourning shall come to you. Ye think that you can escape punishment, when ye repose quietly on your beds; but though your chambers be closed, though ye move not a finger, yet mourning shall come to you.” We now see the connection between the words, mourning and resting in idleness and indulgence. The word <span class="lang he-il">סרח</span>, <em>sarech, </em>means indeed properly to recumb; and hence some render the passage, “Mourning shall rest on you:” but the more received meaning is, <em>Mourning shall come on you while recumbing. </em>Though then they stretched out themselves on their beds, that they might pleasantly and softly recumb and rest themselves, yet mourning would come to them, that is, would enter into their chambers. </p><p><strong>(43)</strong> The words are <span class="lang he-il">וסר מרזה סרוחים</span>, <em>usar merezach saruchim, </em>— an instance of striking alliteration. But Calvin’s rendering, though amounting in its general import to the same thing, is certainly not the correct one. <span class="lang he-il">סר</span> never means to come, but the reverse, to depart. To decline, to turn aside or away, or to depart, is its common signification. Then <span class="lang he-il">מרזה</span> is properly shouting, either for grief or for joy; here evidently for the latter; and it may be rendered here mirth; so the clause may be thus translated — </p><p><em>And depart shall the mirth of the recumbents, </em><em><LineBreak /></em>or<em>, of those who stretch themselves. </em></p><p>Dr. Henderson’s version is the following: — </p><p>And the shouting company of those that recline shall depart. </p><p>The translation of Symmachus is, “Taken away shall be the company of the voluptuous, <span class="lang el-gr">ἑταιρεία τρυφητων</span> ” The idea of “banquet” for the word here used, is what the Rabbins have given to it. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
