<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>In whom we have redemption. </em>The apostle is still illustrating the material cause, — the manner in which we are reconciled to God through Christ. By his death he has restored us to favor with the Father; and therefore we ought always to direct our minds to the blood of Christ, as the means by which we obtain divine grace. After mentioning that, through the blood of Christ, we obtain redemption, he immediately styles it <em>the forgiveness of sins, </em>— to intimate that we are redeemed, because our sins are not imputed to us. Hence it follows, that we obtain by free grace that righteousness by which we are accepted of God, and freed from the chains of the devil and of death. The close connection which is here preserved, between our redemption itself and the manner in which it is obtained, deserves our notice; for, so long as we remain exposed to the judgment of God, we are bound by miserable chains, and therefore our exemption from guilt, becomes an invaluable freedom. </p><p><em>According to the riches of his grace. </em>He now returns to the efficient cause, — the largeness of the divine kindness, which has given Christ to us as our Redeemer. <em>Riches, </em>and the corresponding word <em>overflow, </em>in the following verse, are intended to give us large views of divine grace. The apostle feels himself unable to celebrate, in a proper manner, the goodness of God, and desires that the contemplation of it would occupy the minds of men till they are entirely lost in admiration. How desirable is it that men were deeply impressed with “the riches of that grace” which is here commended! No place would any longer be found for pretended satisfactions, or for those trifles by which the world vainly imagines that it can redeem itself; as if the blood of Christ, when unsupported by additional aid, had lost all its efficacy. <span class="cite-ref">(112)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(112)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme si le sang de Christ sechoit et perdoit sa vigueur</span>.” “As if the blood of Christ were dried up, and lost its force.” </p></div></div>
