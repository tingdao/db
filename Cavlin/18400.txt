<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>The writing of Hezekiah. </em>Though sacred history gives no account of this writing, yet it deserves to be recorded, and is highly worthy of observation; for we see that Hezekiah was unwilling to pass in silence, or to bury in forgetfulness, so remarkable a blessing which he had received from God. By his example he shews what all believers ought to do, when God miraculously and in an unusual manner exerts his power on their behalf. They ought to make known their gratitude, not only to their contemporaries, but also to posterity; as we see that Hezekiah did by this song, which may be regarded as a public record. We see that David composed many psalms on this subject, when he had been delivered from very great dangers, so that he took care to celebrate till the end of the world what was worthy of being remembered by all ages. (<span class="bvs">Psa_18:2</span>.) Especially, the more eminent any man is, and the higher the station which he occupies, the more is he bound to consider himself as placed by God on a theater, and enjoined to perform this duty. <span class="cite-ref">(80)</span> Yet all men, whether they be of ordinary rank or nobles and great men, ought to beware of ambition, lest, while they profess to imitate Hezekiah and David, they magnify their own name more than the name of God. <span class="cite-ref">(81)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(80)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Doit considerer et savoir que ce que fait ici Ezechias, luy est enjoint en cas semblable</span>.” “Ought to consider and know that what Hezekiah does here is enjoined on him in a similar case.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(81)</span> “The conjecture of Grotius, that Isaiah dictated the psalm, or put it into Hezekiah’s mouth, is perfectly gratuitous. That Hezekiah should compose a psalm is not more strange than that he should make a collection of proverbs. (<span class="bvs">Pro_25:1</span>.) It would have been far more strange if one so much like David, in character and spirit, had not followed his example in the practice of devotional composition.” — <em>Alexander. </em></p></div></div>
