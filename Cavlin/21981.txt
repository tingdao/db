<div class="comment-content"><p>Those who read the noun <span class="lang he-il">קף</span><em>ketz, </em>“<em>end, </em>” in the genitive case in <span class="bvs">Dan_8:17</span>, understand in this place the word “vision” again, as if the Prophet had said, “At the time of the end there shall be a vision.” But as <span class="lang he-il">מועד</span>, <em>meveged, </em>or <em>moed, </em>signifies a “time fixed and settled beforehand,” there is nothing superfluous in that method of speech; then <em>ketz, </em>as I have said, is properly taken for the effect itself, and it would be harsh and far-fetched to say “at the time of the end there shall be a vision,” in the, sense of the filling up of the vision. For this word expresses all which such interpreters wish it to imply. Besides, all are agreed as to the matter itself, since the angel bears witness to his being the interpreter chosen by God, who explains futurity to the Prophet. <em>Behold, </em>therefore, says he, <em>I will explain to thee </em>He here acquires confidence for himself from his office, as he had accepted the commands divinely laid upon him. And we should remark this also, since our faith will never rest or become firm unless the authority on which it is founded be fixed. As then the angel declares himself to be executing an office divinely enjoined upon him, ought we to put confidence in men who conduct themselves with rashness, and, though they assume authority in God’s name, yet have no certain and lawful calling? We may learn, then, how neither angels nor men ought to be held in such honor as to induce us to receive whatever they bring forward, unless the Almighty has appointed them to be his ministers and interpreters. </p><p>He then says, <em>I will announce to thee what shall happen even at the end of the wrath. </em>Without doubt, the angel asserts by this phrase the suddenness of God’s wrath. We are aware how instantaneously on the return of the people their enemies attacked them in Judea, and never ceased to inflict upon them numberless troubles. Wherefore, as soon as the Jews had returned from exile, God began to exercise them in various ways, and not without sufficient reason. Every one privately studied his own interests, but without any regard for the temple and any desire for the worship of God, and thus they were given up to avarice and caprice. They also defrauded God himself in tithes and offerings, as is evident from the prophets Malachi and Haggai. (<span class="bvs">Hag_1:12</span>; <span class="bvs">Mal_3:8</span>.) From that period God began to punish them, but deferred his vengeance till the time of Antiochus. The angel, therefore, calls <em>the end of the vengeance </em>that severer punishment which God inflicted after the people had abused his forbearance. Therefore <em>I will teach thee, </em>or lay before time, <em>what shall happen at the close of the vengeance, because, </em>says he, <em>it shall be the time of the end. </em>He here repeats what he had said concerning the effect of the prophecy, meaning, the fulfillment should take place at its own appointed season. We must; now notice the noun <em>moed, </em>because it is here opposed to our fervor and intemperance. Haste in desiring anything leads, as they say, to delay; for as soon as God bears witness to anything, we wish it to be fulfilled at the very first moment, and if he suspend its execution only a very few days, we not only wonder but cry out with vexation. God, therefore, here admonishes us by his angel that he has a settled time, and thus we are to learn to put a bridle on ourselves, and not to be rash and unseasonably hasty, according to our usual habit. We ought, then, to remember the explanation given, and perceive how the effect of the vision is shewn here, and thus it will obtain from us its just reverence. It follows: — </p></div>
