<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion </em>For the confirmation of the statement made in the preceding sentence, the prophet celebrates the excellencies for which mount Zion was at that time renowned; and in them was to be seen the glory of God, of which I have just now spoken. The beauty of its situation, which he mentions in the first place, was indeed natural; but by it he gives us to understand, that from the very commencement the agreeable appearance of the city had engraven upon it marks of the favor of God, so that the sight of it alone showed that God had in a special manner adorned and enriched that place, with the view of its being, at some future period, consecrated to sacred purposes. I do not, however, think that the situation is called beautiful and pleasant, merely because it was unequalled in the country of Judea; for there were other cities, as is well known, which were in no respect inferior to Jerusalem, either as to fertility or pleasantness of situation, and other advantages. In my opinion, along with the situation of the city, the Psalmist comprehends the glory which it derived from another source — from the circumstance that the temple of God was built there. When, therefore, we hear the beauty of the city here celebrated, let us call to our remembrance that spiritual beauty which was added to the natural beauty of the place, after the prophecy was given forth that the ark would there abide for ever. With respect to the word <span class="lang he-il">נופ</span>,<em>noph, </em>which I have translated <em>situation, </em>commentators are not agreed. Some understand it as meaning <em>height </em>or <em>elevation, </em>as if it had been said that Jerusalem was situated on high and elevated ground. Others render it<em>climate </em><span class="cite-ref">(190)</span> because the Jews metaphorically call climates <em>branches, </em><span class="cite-ref">(191)</span> on account of the extent to which they are spread out. In a matter like this, which is of no great consequence, I am not disposed to be so very critical. Only I have selected that translation which seemed to me the most probable, namely, that the country in its appearance was pre-eminently pleasant and delightful. When the Psalmist speaks of mount Zion being <em>on the sides of the north, </em>it is doubtful whether he lays it down as a commendation of mount Zion, that it lay or looked towards the north; or whether we should explain the sentence thus: Although mount Zion looks towards the north, that does not in any degree diminish its beauty. The former interpretation, however, seems to me to give the more natural meaning. We find the prophet Isaiah, with the view also of touching upon the excellence of this mountain, applying to it the very expression which is here employed. In the 14<span class="cite-ref">th</span> chapter of his Prophecies, at the 13th verse, he represents Sennacherib as speaking thus: “I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north.” </p><p>The Psalmist, in the next place, calls mount Zion <em>the joy of the whole earth </em>And he thus describes it, not only because, as the Jews foolishly talk, that country was healthy on account of the mildness of the climate; or because it produced sweet and excellent fruits, which might gratify ard yield delight to foreign nations — for this also is a cold and unsatisfactory speculation; — but because from thence salvation was to issue forth to the whole world, even as all nations have borrowed from thence the light of life, and the testimony of heavenly grace. If the joy which men experience and cherish is without God, the issue of their joy at length will be destruction, and their laughter will be turned into gnashing of teeth. But Christ appeared with his Gospel out of Zion, to fill the world with true joy and everlasting felicity. In the time of the prophet, the knowledge of the Gospel, it is true, had not yet reached foreign nations; but he makes use of this manner of expression with the highest propriety, to teach the Jews that true blessedness was to be sought for only from the gracious covenant of God, which was deposited in that holy place. At the same time also, he has foretold that which was at length fulfilled in the last time by the coming of Christ. From this we may learn, that to cause the hearts of the godly to rejoice, the favor of God alone abundantly suffices; as, on the contrary, when it is withdrawn, all men must inevitably be thrown into a state of wretchedness and sorrow. What is added immediately after, concerning <em>the city of the great King, </em>is intended to show, that mount Zion was not only holy itself, but that this high prerogative had been conferred upon it to render sacred the whole city, where God had chosen his seat, that he might rule over all people. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(190)</span><em>Beautiful in climate</em>, that is, mount Zion is situated in a fair and lovely climate. This is the view taken by Montanus and Ainsworth. Bate and Parkhurst read, “<em>Beautiful in extension</em>, <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , in the prospect which it extends to the eye.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(191)</span> Some ancient copies of the Septuagint have for the original words, <span class="lang he-il">יפה ניף</span>, <em>yepheh noph</em>, which Calvin renders <em>beautiful for situation</em>, <span class="lang el-gr">εὐρύνων</span>, which Augustine and Ambrose translate by <em>dilatans </em>,<em>spreading </em>“This,” says Hammond, “may not improbably have respect to a notion of <span class="lang he-il">נוף</span>, usual in the <em>Misneh </em>for the <em>boughs </em>or <em>top branches of a tree</em>; which some of the Jews also would have take place here, as comparing <em>Zion </em>to <em>a beautiful well-spreading </em>tree.” </p></div></div>
