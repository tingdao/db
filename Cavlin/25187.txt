<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_6:40</span><strong>.</strong><em>The disciple is not above his master, but every one shall be conformed to his master </em>Luke gives this sentence without any connection, as if it had been spoken abruptly in the midst of other discourses; but as Matthew explains very clearly, in this passage, to what it relates, I have chosen not to insert it in any other place. With respect to the translation, I have chosen neither to follow Erasmus nor the old translator, and for the following reason: — The participle <span class="lang el-gr">κατηρτισμένος</span>, signifies <em>perfect, </em>but signifies also <em>fit and suitable </em>Now, as Christ is speaking, not about perfection, but about resemblance, and must therefore mean, that nothing is more <em>suitable </em>for a <em>disciple </em>than to be formed after the example of his <em>master, </em>the latter meaning appeared to me to be more appropriate. </p></div>
