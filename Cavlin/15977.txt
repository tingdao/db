<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>78.</strong><em>Let the proud be put to shame. </em>We have already often had occasion to remark, that, in the Hebrew language, the future tense is frequently used in the sense of the optative mood, as here, — They <em>shall be put to shame, </em>for, <em>Let them be put to shame. </em>Still it would not be unsuitable to explain the meaning thus’ As the proud have dealt mischievously with me, and molested me without a cause, the Lord will give them their reward. But as almost all interpreters are agreed that this is a prayer, in the translation of the verse I am unwilling to depart from the generally received explanation, especially as the language is expressly addressed to God himself. It is important to attend to the reason why the Psalmist hopes that God will be an enemy to <em>his </em>enemies; namely, because they wickedly and maliciously assaulted him. The word <span class="lang he-il">שקר</span><em>, sheker, </em>which I have rendered <em>falsely, </em>is by some translated, <em>without a cause; </em>but they seem only to hit upon the one half of the prophet’s meaning; for this word, in my opinion, is to be referred to the stratagems and artifices by which the wicked endeavored to destroy David. Whence we gather, that whenever we are wrongfully persecuted by wicked men, we are invited to have recourse directly to God for protection. At the same time, we are taught that we have no reason to be abashed at their insolence; for, whatever power they may arrogate to themselves, He will beat down their loftiness, and lay it low, to their shame; so that, being confounded, they will serve as an example, to teach others that nothing is more ridiculous than to sing the song of triumph before the victory is gained. The verb <span class="lang he-il">אשיח</span>, <em>asiach, </em>in the second clause of the verse, may be rendered, <em>I will speak of, </em>as well as<em>I will meditate upon; </em>implying, that, when he had obtained the victory, he would proclaim the goodness of God, which he had experienced. <em>To speak of God’s statutes, </em>is equivalent to declaring out of the law, how faithfully he guards his saints, how securely he delivers them, and how righteously he avenges their wrongs. </p></div>
