<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Be not thou, then, far from me, O Jehovah! </em>We must keep in mind all that David has hitherto related concerning himself. As his miseries had reached the utmost height, and as he saw not even a single ray of hope to encourage him to expect deliverance, it is a wonderful instance of the power of faith, that he not only endured his afflictions patiently, but that from the abyss of despair he arose to call upon God. Let us, therefore, particularly mark, that David did not pour out his lamentations thinking them to be in vain, and of no effect, as persons who are in perplexity often pour forth their groanings at random. The prayers which he adds sufficiently show that he hoped for such an issue as he desired. When he calls God <em>his strength, </em>by this epithet he gives a more evident proof of his faith. He does not pray in a doubting manner; but he promises himself the assistance which the eye of sense did not as yet perceive. By <em>the sword, </em>by <em>the hand of the dog, </em>by <em>the mouth of the lion, </em>and by <em>the horns of the unicorns, </em>he intimates that he was presently exposed to the danger of death, and that in many ways. Whence we gather, that although he utterly fainted in himself when thus surrounded by death, he yet continued strong in the Lord, and that the spirit of life had always been vigorous in his heart. Some take the words <em>only soul, </em>or <em>only life, </em>for <em>dear </em>and <em>precious; </em><span class="cite-ref">(517)</span> but this view does not appear to me to be appropriate. He rather means, that, amidst so many deaths he found no help or succor in the whole world; as in <span class="bvs">Psa_35:17</span> the words, <em>only soul, </em><span class="cite-ref">(518)</span> are used in the same sense for a person who is alone and destitute of all aid and succor. This will appear more clearly from <span class="bvs">Psa_25:16</span>, where David, by calling himself poor and alone, doubtless complains that he was completely deprived of friends, and forsaken of the whole world. When it is said in the end of the 21<span class="cite-ref">st</span> verse, <em>Answer me, </em>or, <em>Hear me from the horns of the unicorns, </em>this Hebrew manner of speaking may seem strange and obscure to our ears, but the sense is not at all ambiguous. The cause is only put instead of the effect; for our deliverance is the consequence or effect of God’s hearing us. If it is asked how this can be applied to Christ, whom the Father did not deliver from death? I answer, in one word, that he was more mightily delivered than if God had prevented him from falling a victim to death, even as it is a much greater deliverance to rise again from the dead than to be healed of a grievous malady. Death, therefore, did not prevent Christ’s resurrection from at length bearing witness that he had been heard. </p><p><strong>(517)</strong> That is, my life, which is dear and precious to me. </p><p><strong>(518)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La vie esseulee</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “Life deserted or left alone.” </p></div>
