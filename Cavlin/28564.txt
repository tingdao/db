<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Know ye not, that they who run in a race. </em>He has laid down the doctrine, and now, with the view of impressing it upon the minds of the Corinthians, he adds an exhortation. He states briefly, that what they had hitherto attained was nothing, unless they steadfastly persevered, inasmuch as it is not enough to have once entered on the Lord’s way, if they do not strive until they reach the goal, agreeably to that declaration of Christ — <em>He that shall endure unto the end</em>, etc. (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:22</span>.) Now he borrows a similitude from the race-course. <span class="cite-ref">(508)</span> For as in that case many descend into the arena, but he alone is crowned who has first reached the goal, so there is no reason why any one should feel satisfied with himself on the ground of his having once entered upon the race prescribed in the gospel, unless he persevere in it until death. There is, however, this difference between our contest and theirs, that among them only <em>one </em>is victorious, and obtains the palm — the man who has got before all the others; <span class="cite-ref">(509)</span> but our condition is superior in this respect, that there may be <em>many </em>at the same time. <span class="cite-ref">(510)</span> For God requires from us nothing more than that we press on vigorously until we reach the goal. <span class="cite-ref">(511)</span> Thus one does not hinder another: nay more, those who run in the Christian race are mutually helpful to each other. He expresses the same sentiment in another form in <span class="bvs">2Ti_2:5</span>, </p><p>If any one striveth, he is not crowned, unless he strives lawfully. </p><p><em>So run. </em>Here we have the application of the similitude — that it is not enough to have set out, if we do not continue to run during our whole life. For our life is like a race-course. We must not therefore become wearied after a short time, like one that stops short in the middle of the race-course, but instead of this, death alone must put a period to our running. The particle <span class="lang el-gr">ὅυτω</span>, (<em>so</em>,) may be taken in two ways. Chrysostom connects it with what goes before, in this manner: as those who run do not stop running until they have reached the goal, so do ye also persevere, and do not stop running so long as you live. It will, however, correspond not inaptly with what follows. “You must not run <em>so </em>as to stop short in the middle of the race-course, but <em>so </em>as to obtain the prize.” As to the term <em>stadium</em>, (<em>race-course</em>,) and the different kinds of races, <span class="cite-ref">(512)</span> I say nothing, as these things may be obtained from grammarians, and it is generally known that there were some races on horseback, and others on foot. Nor are these things particularly needed for understanding Paul’s meaning. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(508)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De ceux qui conrent a la lice pour quelque pris</span>;” — “From those who run in the race-course for some prize.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(509)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui a mieux couru que los antres, et est le premier venu au but</span>;” — “Who has run better than the others, and has come first to the goal.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(510)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">I1 yen pent auoir plusieurs de nons qui soyent couronnez</span>;” — “There may be many of us that are crowned.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(511)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que nons ne perdions point courage, mais que perscuerions constamment jusques a la fin</span>;” — “That we do not lose heart, but persevere steadfastly unto the end.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(512)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui estoyent anciennement en vsage</span>;” — “Which were anciently in use.” </p></div></div>
