<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>46.</strong><em>Let Jehovah live. </em>If it is thought proper to adopt this reading, which is in the optative mood expressing a wish <em>that God might live, </em>the manner of expression may seem somewhat strange; but it may be alleged in defense of it, that it is a metaphor borrowed from the custom of men, who not only use this manner of speaking when they wish well to any one, but likewise utter it with loud and applauding acclamation, when they intend to receive their princes with due honor. According to this view, it would be an expression in which praise is ascribed to God, and suitable for a triumphal song. <span class="cite-ref">(441)</span> It may, however, be very properly considered as a simple affirmation, in which David declares that <em>God lives, </em>in other words, that he is endued with sovereign power. Farther, the life which David attributes to God is not to be restricted to the being or essence of God, but is rather to be understood of the evidence of it deducible from his works, which manifest to us that he liveth. Whenever he withdraws the working of his power from before our eyes, the sense and cognisance of the truth, “God liveth,” also evanishes from our minds. He is, therefore, said <em>to live, </em>inasmuch as he shows, by evident proofs of his power, that it is he who preserves and upholds the world. And as David had known, by experience, this life of God, he celebrates it with praises and thanksgiving. If we read the first clause in the present tense, <em>The Lord liveth, </em>the copula <em>and, </em>which follows, has the force of an inference; and, accordingly, the words should be resolved thus:— <em>Jehovah liveth, and, therefore, blessed be my strength </em>The epithet, <em>My strength, </em>and the other which occurs in verse 48<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, <em>My deliverer, </em>confirm what I have already stated, that God does not simply live in himself, and in his secret place, but displays his vital energy in the government of the whole world. The Hebrew word, <span class="lang he-il">צורי</span>,<em>tsuri, </em>which we have translated <em>my strength, </em>is here to be understood in a transitive sense for <em>Him </em>who bestows strength. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(441)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ainsi ce seroit un mot tendant a lour Dieu et convenable a un cantique de triomphe</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
