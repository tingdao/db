What follows the first clause, <em>As being yourselves also in the body, </em>is variously explained. Some take a general view thus, “Ye are also exposed to the same evils, according to the common lot of humanity;” but others give a more restricted sense, “As though ye were in their body.” Of neither can I approve, for I apply the words to the body of the Church, so that the meaning would be this, “Since ye are members of the same body, it behooves you to feel in common for each other’s evils, that there may be nothing disunited among you.” <span class="cite-ref">(276)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(276)</span> What Beza says of this opinion is, “I by no means reject it, though I regard the other (first mentioned here) as the most obvious.” It has been said that whenever Paul mentions the mystical body, it is in connection with Christ, <span class="bvs">Rom_12:5</span>, and that “in the body” is to be understood literally, <span class="bvs">2Co_5:6</span>. It is so taken here by Grotius, Doddridge, Scott, and Stuart. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
