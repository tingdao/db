<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>109.</strong><em>My soul is continually in my hand. </em>He declares, that no calamities, afflictions, or dangers, which he had experienced: had withdrawn him from the service of God, and the observance of his law. <em>To bear his soul in his hand, </em>is equivalent to his being in danger of his life, so that the soul was, as it were abandoned to the wind. Thus Job, (<span class="bvs">Job_13:14</span>,) when he pines in his miseries: and is looking for death every moment, and dreading it, complains that his soul was in his hand; as if he had said, It is plucked from its own dwelling-place: and is under the dominion of death. <span class="cite-ref">(434)</span> This form of expression is therefore unhappily wrested to an absurd meaning by ignorant people, who understand the prophet as intimating, that it was in his own power to govern his life as he pleased. So far from intending to convey such an idea, by this circumstance he commends his own piety, declaring, that although he was tossed among shipwrecks, and death in a hundred forms hovered before his eyes, so that he could not rest in security for a single moment, yet he had not cast from him the love and study of the Divine law. Here, again, it is well to notice the severe and arduous conflicts by which the fathers, under the law, were tried, that dangers and fears may not frighten us, or, by the weariness they produce, deprive us of courage, and thus prevent the remembrance of the Divine law from remaining impressed on our hearts. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(434)</span> This proverbial expression occurs in several other places of Scripture, in all of which it undoubtedly signifies, that the life of the person who employs it is in danger; as in <span class="bvs">Jud_12:3</span>, “And when I saw that ye delivered me not, <em>I put my life in my hands</em>, and passed over against the children of Ammon;” <span class="bvs">1Sa_19:5</span>, “<em>He put his life in his hand</em>, and slew the Philistines;” and <span class="bvs">1Sa_28:21</span>, “And the woman came unto Saul, and said, <em>I have put my life in my hand</em>. ” Phillips thus explains the figure: “We are accustomed to say, that an affair is in a person’s hands when the management and issue of it rest entirely with him, and so we speak when that affair is the life or death of an individual. Hence, similarly, when the Hebrews spoke of a person’s life being in his own hands, they might mean, that the preservation of his life was entirely with him, that he was destitute of all external assistance, and that consequently his life was in danger. This is particularly the case with military men, who, as they fight bravely, or otherwise, may preserve or lose their lives: so Jephthah, as appears from the passages above cited.” The figure may, however, be taken from the circumstance, that what a man carries openly in his hand is in danger of taking, or of being snatched away by violence. “The LXX. have changed the person of the pronoun, <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν ταῖς χερσι σου</span>; <em>in thy hands</em>; as also the Syriac. It is probable that these ancient interpreters did not understand the phrase, and so expressed it according to what they thought might be the original reading, thus affording a very obvious sense. Augustine says, that many MSS. in his time had the second person. However, no such MSS. are known now, and there is no doubt whatever of the correctness of the present text. The Psalmist states that, though his life was in danger, yet he did not forget God’s law.” — <em>Ibid </em></p></div></div>
