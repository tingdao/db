<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>One indeed, etc. </em>He had spoken before of scruples in the choice of meats; he now adds another example of difference, that is, as to days; and both these arose from Judaism. For as the Lord in his law made a difference between meats and pronounced some to be unclean, the use of which he prohibited, and as he had also appointed festal and solemn days and commanded them to be observed, the Jews, who had been brought up from their childhood in the doctrine of the law, would not lay aside that reverence for days which they had entertained from the beginning, and to which through life they had been accustomed; nor could they have dared to touch these meats from which they had so long abstained. That they were imbued with these notions, was an evidence of their weakness; they would have thought otherwise, had they possessed a certain and a clear knowledge of Christian liberty. But in abstaining from what they thought to be unlawful, they evidenced piety, as it would have been a proof of presumption and contempt, had they done anything contrary to the dictates of conscience. </p><p>Here then the Apostle applies the best rule, when he bids every one to be fully assured as to his own mind; by which he intimates that there ought to be in Christians such a care for obedience, that they do nothing, except what they think, or rather feel assured, is pleasing to God. <span class="cite-ref">(418)</span> And this ought to be thoroughly borne in mind, that it is the first principle of a right conduct, that men should be dependent on the will of God, and never allow themselves to move even a finger, while the mind is doubtful and vacillating; for it cannot be otherwise, but that rashness will soon pass over into obstinacy when we dare to proceed further than what we are persuaded is lawful for us. If any object and say, that infirmity is ever perplexing, and that hence such certainty as Paul requires cannot exist in the weak: to this the plain answer is, — That such are to be pardoned, if they keep themselves within their own limits. For Paul’s purpose was none other than to restrain undue liberty, by which it happens, that many thrust themselves, as it were, at random, into matters which are doubtful and undetermined. Hence Paul requires this to be adopted, — that the will of God is to preside over all our actions. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(418)</span> “Unusquisque sententiae suae certus sit<span class="lang el-gr">;” ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ νοὶ πληροφορείσθω; </span> “unusquisque in animo suo plene certus esto — let every one be fully sure in his own mind,” [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>], [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>]; “let every one be convinced in his mind,” [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>]; “let every one freely enjoy his own sentiment,” [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] This last is by no means the sense: Our own version is the best and the most literal, “let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind;” and with which [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] <em>’s </em>exposition perfectly agrees.

The certain persuasion here refers to both parties — the eater and the abstainer: both were to do what they were fully convinced was agreeable to the will of God. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
