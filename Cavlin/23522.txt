<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>Neither in the present life </em>What these words mean, Mark briefly explains by saying, that<em>those who have spoken against the Spirit are exposed to eternal judgment </em>Every day we ask from God the forgiveness of sins, and every day he reconciles us to Him; and, finally, at death, he takes away all our sins, and declares that he is gracious to us. The fruit of this mercy will appear at the last day. The meaning therefore is: — “There is no reason to expect that those who shall have blasphemed against the Spirit will obtain pardon in this life, or will be acquitted in the last judgment.” </p><p>With regard to the inference drawn by the Papists, that the sins of men are forgiven after death, there is no difficulty in refuting their slander. First, they act foolishly in torturing the expression, <em>future life, </em>to mean an intermediate period, while any one may perceive that it denotes “the last judgment.” But it is likewise a proof of their dishonesty; for the objection which they sophistically urge is inconsistent with their own doctrine. Who knows not their distinction, that sins are freely pardoned in respect of guilt, but that punishment and satisfaction are demanded? This is an acknowledgment, that there is no hope of salvation to any one whose guilt is not pardoned before death. To the dead, therefore, there remains no forgiveness, except as regards punishment; and surely they will not venture to deny that the subject of this discourse is guilt. Let them now go and light their fire of purgatory with these cold materials, if ice can kindle a flame. <span class="cite-ref">(133)</span></p><p><strong>(133)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Voire s’i1 est possible de tant souffler la glace, qu’on la face flamber</span>;” — “that is, if it be possible to blow upon the ice in such a manner as to produce a flame.” </p></div>
