<div class="comment-content"><p>He afterwards adds, <em>And when thou hast made an end of reading, thou shalt tie a stone to it and cast it into the Euphrates, and shalt say, Thus sink shall Babylon </em>Here is added an external symbol to confirm the faith of Seraiah. We must yet bear in mind, that this was not said to Seraiah for his own sake alone, but that the people might also know, that the king’s messenger, who had been sent for the sake of conciliating, was also the messenger of God and of the Prophet, who might have otherwise been despised by the people. When, therefore, the faithful knew this, they were in no ordinary way confirmed in the truth of the prophecy. Jeremiah, then, not only consulted the benefit of Seraiah alone, but that of all the godly; for though this was unknown for a long time, yet the messenger afterwards acknowledged that this command had been given him by Jeremiah, and that he took the book and cast it into the Euphrates. This, then, was given as a confirmation to all the godly. </p><p>As to the symbols by which God sealed the prophecies in former times, we have spoken elsewhere; I therefore pass them by slightly now: only we ought to bear in mind this one thing, that these signs were only temporary sacraments; for ordinary sacraments are permanent, as the holy supper and baptism. But the sign mentioned here was temporary, and referred, as they say, to a special action: it yet had the force and character of a sacrament, as to its use, the confirmation of this prophecy. Seraiah was then bidden to <em>tie a stone </em>to the book, and then to <em>cast it into the Euphrates: </em>why so? that the volume might not swim on the surface of the water, but be sunk down to the bottom; and the application follows, <em>Thou shalt say, etc</em>. We see that words ought ever to be connected with signs. We hence conclude how fatuous the Papists are, who practice many ceremonies, but without knowledge. They are, indeed, dead and empty things, whatever signs men may devise for themselves, except God’s word be added. <em>Thou shalt </em>then <em>say, Thus sink shall Babylon, and shall not rise from the evil which I shall bring upon her </em>In short, Seraiah was commanded, as the Prophet’s messenger, to predict by himself concerning the fall of Babylon; but it was for the sake of all the godly, who were afterwards taught what had been done. <span class="cite-ref">(114)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(114)</span> Calvin takes no notice here of the verb which closes this sentence, <span class="lang he-il">ויעפו</span>; but in his version he renders it, “and they shall fly,” or they shall be wearied. Critics know not what to make of it: it is omitted in the <em>Sept</em>. , and rendered by the <em>Vulg</em>. , “and it shall be dissolved;” by the <em>Syr</em>. , “but they shall be thrown down;” and by the <em>Targ</em>. , “and they shall fail.” It is left out in no MS. <em>Blayney</em>, following the <em>Sept</em>. , omits it. The best explanation is given by <em>Junius </em>and <em>Tremelius</em>, “though they may weary themselves,” that is, the citizens of Babylon: their attempt to rise and resist their enemies would be ineffectual, however much they might toil in the effort. </p><p>The emendator, <em>Houbigant</em>, proposes to read the word, <span class="lang he-il">ויספו</span>, “and they shall come to an end.” This agrees nearly with the <em>Targ</em>. , “and they shall fail.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
