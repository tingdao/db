<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses. </em>It is obvious that this foolish and preposterous jealousy arose from a good source. Joshua saw that Moses was so preeminent above all others, as to be justly deemed, after God, the head of the people; he feared, therefore, lest, if any portion of his superiority should be withdrawn, the grace of God would be dispelled and lost. We know, too, that almost every change is injurious, and apt to give a shock to public affairs. In asserting, then, the rights of Moses, he desired, as far as he could, to consult the welfare of all; but the excess of his zeal had some alloy in it, in consequence of the immoderate affection and love which he bore to Moses; just as it often happens to ourselves, that although our desires have a right object, they still go astray into erroneous feelings. So, then, let us learn to revere the most illustrious servants of Christ, as that God alone should be supreme; and that He, who is far above all, should still maintain His pre-eminence. And this will be the case, if we hold fast to the principle, that although “there are diversities of gifts,” yet there is but one Spirit from whom they flow; and although there are “differences of administrations,” yet but one Lord who must be served, (<span class="bvs">1Co_12:4</span>;) which also Paul confirms elsewhere, where he teaches us that the gifts are so distributed as that no individual should have all, but each </p><p>“according to the measure of the gift of Christ.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Eph_4:7</span>.) </p></div>
