<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>So then, brethren</em>, <em>etc. </em>This is the conclusion of what has been previously said; for if we are to renounce the flesh, we ought not to consent to it; and if the Spirit ought to reign in us, it is inconsistent not to attend to his bidding. Paul’s sentence is here defective, for he omits the other part of the contrast, — that we are debtors to the Spirit; but the meaning is in no way obscure. <span class="cite-ref">(251)</span> This conclusion has the force of an exhortation; for he is ever wont to draw exhortations from his doctrine. So in another place, <span class="bvs">Eph_4:30</span>, he exhorts us </p><p>“not to grieve the Spirit of God, by whom we have been sealed to the day of redemption:” </p><p>he does the same in <span class="bvs">Gal_5:25</span>, </p><p>“If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.” </p><p>And this is the case, when we renounce carnal lusts, so as to devote ourselves, as those who are bound, to the righteousness of God. Thus indeed we ought to reason, not as some blasphemers are wont to do, who talk idly, and say, — that we must do nothing, because we have no power. But it is as it were to fight against God, when we extinguish the grace offered to us, by contempt and negligence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(251)</span> He did not mention the other part, says [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>], “because it was so evident.” Besides, what he had already stated, and what he proceeds to state, are so many evidences of our obligations to live after the Spirit, that it was unnecessary to make such an addition. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
