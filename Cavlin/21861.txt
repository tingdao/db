<div class="comment-content"><p>Daniel follows up what he had begun with perseverance, shewing judgment to be overhanging the king of Babylon. He calls him lord, indeed, with cordiality; meanwhile he was the ambassador of the Supreme King, he did not hesitate to elevate his discourse above the king’s command — as all the prophets do who rise up against mountains and hills, as Jeremiah does in <span class="bvs">Jer_1:10</span>. Thus this sentence is worthy of notice, — “I have appointed thee over kingdoms and peoples, to pluck them up and to plant them, to build and to destroy.” God, therefore, wishes to assert so great a reverence for his Word, because there is nothing in the world so magnificent or splendid which does not yield to it. Daniel, then, as far as <em>concerns </em>human events and political order, confesses the king to be his master; but meanwhile he goes on with the embassy entrusted to him. <em>The king then, </em>says he, <em>saw a watcher descend from heaven, </em>he always speaks of an angel <span class="cite-ref">(221)</span> We have stated why Scripture calls angels “<em>watchers, </em>” since they are at hand to perform God’s commands; and we know God executes his decrees by their agency: I said angels always discharge this duty, and keep watch over the faithful. But the name “<em>watcher </em>” is a general one, and implies the promptness with which angels are endued, to enable them to discharge with the utmost celerity whatever God enjoins upon them. <em>Thou hast seen, then, one descend from heaven, who said, Cut down the tree, and scatter it abroad </em>He repeats what he had said before, namely, the time of his punishment was defined here, because God would destroy the king of Babylon and all remembrance of him. An exception is then added, — Until <em>seven times pass over </em>I have said nothing of those times, but their opinion is probable who take it for an indefinite number, meaning, until a long time shall pass away. Others think months denoted; others, years; but I willingly incline to this interpretation, since God wishes for no short time to punish King Nebuchadnezzar. It may not seem customary, indeed, but as he wished to put forth an example for all ages, he desired to prolong his punishment. This, therefore, seems the meaning of the seven years; for we know the number seven years to signify a long time in Scripture, since it denotes perfection. </p><p><strong>(221)</strong> See Dissertation 14 at the end of this Volume. </p></div>
