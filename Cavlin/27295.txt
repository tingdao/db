<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>Concerning the matter. </em>Because the Greek text is abrupt, some think that the accusative case is put instead of the nominative; and that the sense is this, This is the word which God hath sent unto the children of Israel. Other some refer it unto the word<em>ye know</em>, which followeth afterward; and they think that there was another word added to make the sentence more pleasant. For Luke putteth <span class="lang el-gr">λογον</span> in the former place, and afterward <span class="lang el-gr">ρημα</span>. But forasmuch as it is common and familiar amongst the Grecians to understand <span class="cite-ref">(701)</span> the prepositions; this sense, which I have set down, seemeth to me more agreeable, though, if the harshness of the speech can be any better mitigated, I will willingly yield. Therefore I take this member to be a preface, which appertaineth unto this worthy work of God, which he showed amongst the children of Israel, preaching peace by Christ. That done, there is added a narration. At length, in the conclusion of his speech, Peter showeth to what end Christ was sent into the world. Furthermore, he beginneth with this commemoration not without cause, That God sent his word unto the children of Israel. And <em>speech </em>is put for<em>thing </em>in the Hebrew phrase. The eternal covenant which God had made with that people was at that time famous. There was nothing more commonly known among the Jews than that there was a Redeemer promised in times past to the fathers, who should restore things which were decayed unto a flourishing and blessed estate. This did those also know who were familiarly conversant with the Jews. Therefore, to the end Peter may purchase greater credit, he saith that he will speak of no new or unknown thing, but of the restoring of the Church, which did depend upon the eternal covenant of God, and which was now manifestly showed, and almost in every man’s mouth. </p><p><em>Preaching peace. </em>Peter teacheth here what manner [of] rumor and thing that was which was spread abroad; to wit, such as that it did make peace. I take peace in this place for the reconciling of men and God, which, notwithstanding, hath in it the perfect <span class="cite-ref">(702)</span> salvation of the Church. For, as horrible confusion, and, as it were, a huge lump, <span class="cite-ref">(703)</span> do follow after that God is once estranged from us; so, so soon as his fatherly favor doth once appear, he gathereth his Church together, and true felicity ariseth. Therefore, this is Peter’s meaning, that God showed himself merciful to his people in Christ, and that he received into favor Abraham’s children again, (whom he seemed to have cast away for a time,) that he might establish among them a flourishing estate. And as he maketh God the author of this peace, so he placeth Christ in the midst as the pledge thereof, that it may be certain and holy. He coupleth peace and preaching expressly together, because this is one way whereby the fruit of the reconciliation, purchased by Christ, cometh unto us. In like sort, after that Paul had taught that Christ is our peace, he addeth immediately, that he came to preach peace unto those who were nigh at hand and far off, (<span class="bvs">Eph_2:17</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(701)</span> “Subaudire,” to supply. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(702)</span> “Solidam et perfectam,” the perfect and entire. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(703)</span> “Tetrum chaos,” a dire chaos. </p></div></div>
