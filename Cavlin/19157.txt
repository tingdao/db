<div class="comment-content"><p>He intimates in this verse, that all survivors would be doubly miserable, as it would be better for them to die at once than to pine away in unceasing evils: for they who give another meaning to the words, seem not to understand the design of the Prophet. The import then of the passage is, — that however dreadful God’s judgment would be, when slaughters everywhere prevailed, and dead bodies were drawn out which had been previously buried, yet all this would be a slight punishment in comparison with what God would inflict on the rest, such as remained alive: and he also intimates that their life would be more miserable than death itself, yea, than ten deaths. </p><p>That those then who would escape death might not think that they gained any advantage, the Prophet says, <em>Chosen shall be death before life by all the residue </em>We hence learn how grievous was to be God’s vengeance; for nothing would be better or more desirable than to undergo death at once, as life would be nothing else but a continued languor and torment. Expected then <em>will be death </em>in <em>all places </em>in which there shall be survivors, <em>where I shall drive them </em>He mentions a reason for this twofold misery, — they would not be allowed to live in their own country, but would become aliens, — and they would find in their exile God’s hand against them, and as it were following them everywhere. <span class="cite-ref">(217)</span></p><p><strong>(217)</strong> The literal rendering of this verse is as follows, — </p><p>And chosen shall be death rather than life by all the remnant, — Who <em>shall </em>remain of this wicked family, In all the places of such as <em>shall </em>remain, Whither I shall have driven them, Saith Jehovah of hosts. </p><p><em>Blayney </em>justly observes, that the participle in the second line is in apposition with “remnant,“ as explanatory of it, and is not to be put in the genitive case, as in our version. A similar construction is found in <span class="bvs">Jer_24:8</span>. But there is no sufficient authority or reason for omitting the same participle after “places,“ as is done by <em>Blayney. </em>Such repetitions are common in the prophets. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
