<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee. </em>The people of God, I have no doubt, were in captivity when the Holy Spirit endited this prayer; and, therefore, the name of <em>prisoners </em>is applied to them all in general, because they were so shut up within the bounds of Assyria and Chaldea, that had they stirred one foot thence, they would have incurred the penalty of death. They are called <em>the children of death; </em>by which is meant, that they were appointed or condemned to death in respect of their captivity. This sentence, however, may not improperly be restricted to a small number who were shut up in prison under closer restraint. By this expression, it is intimated that those proud spirits who had before vaunted themselves against God, were now broken and effectually humbled. <em>The greatness of God’s arm, </em>that is to say, the greatness of his power, <span class="cite-ref">(383)</span> is implored; for without a signal and extraordinary interposition on his part, no hope could be entertained of the restoration of the Church. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(383)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, de la puissance de Dieu</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
