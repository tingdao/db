<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>49.</strong><em>As we have borne </em>Some have thought, that there is here an exhortation to a pious and holy life, into which Paul was led by way of digression; and on that account they have changed the verb from the future tense into the hortative mood. Nay more, in some Greek manuscripts the reading is <span class="lang el-gr">φορέσωμεν</span><em>(let us bear,) </em><span class="cite-ref">(124)</span> but as that does not suit so well in respect of connection, let us adopt in preference what corresponds better with the object in view and the context. <span class="cite-ref">(125)</span> Let us observe, in the first place, that this is not an exhortation, but pure doctrine, and that he is not treating here of newness of life, but pursues, without any interruption, the thread of his discourse respecting the resurrection of the flesh. The meaning accordingly will be this: “As the <em>animal nature, </em>which has the <em>precedency </em>in us, is the image of Adam, so we shall be conformed to Christ in the <em>heavenly nature; </em>and this will be the completion of our restoration. For we <em>now </em>begin to bear the image of Christ, and are every day more and more transformed into it; <span class="cite-ref">(126)</span> but that image consists in spiritual regeneration. But <em>then </em>it will be fully restored both in body and in soul, and what is now begun will be perfected, and <em>accordingly </em>we will obtain in reality what we as yet only hope for.” If, however, any one prefers a different reading, this statement will serve to spur forward the Corinthians; and if there had been a lively meditation of sincere piety and a new life, it might have been the means of kindling up in them at the same time the hope of heavenly glory. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(124)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pourtant en lieu de </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Nous porterons, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">aucuns ont traduit </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Portons. </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Et mesme aucuns liures Grecs le lisent ainsi</span>;” — “Hence instead of <em>We shall bear, </em>some have rendered it, <em>Let us bear. </em>And even some Greek manuscripts read it thus.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(125)</span> The Alexandrine manuscript, with some others, reads <span class="lang el-gr">φορέσωμεν</span>, <em>let us bear. </em>The rendering of the Vulgate is <em>portemus </em> — <em>(let us bear.) </em>Wiclif (1380) following the Vulgate, as he is wont, renders as follows: <em>bere we also the ymage of the heuenli. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(126)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car nons ne faisons encore que commencer a porter l’image de Jesus Christ</span>;” — “For as yet we do but begin to bear the image of Jesus Christ.” </p></div></div>
