<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Remember the word. </em>It might also be read in the indicative mood, <em>You remember the word</em>, and the meaning is not very different; but I think that it is more suitable to read it in the imperative mood, <em>Remember the word. </em>It is a confirmation of what Christ had spoken immediately before, when he said that he was hated by the world, though he was far more excellent than his disciples; for it is unreasonable that the condition of <em>the servant </em>should be better than that of <em>his master </em>Having spoken of persons, he likewise makes mention of doctrine. </p><p><em>If they have heard my word, they will keep yours also. </em>Nothing gives greater uneasiness to the godly than when they see the doctrine, which is of God, haughtily despised by men; for it is truly shocking and dreadful, and the sight of it might shake the stoutest heart. But when we remember on the other hand, that not less obstinate resistance was manifested against the Son of God himself, we need not wonder that the doctrine of God is so little reverenced among men. When he calls it <em>his doctrine </em>and <em>their doctrine</em>, this refers to the ministry. Christ is the only Teacher of the Church; but he intended that <em>his doctrine</em>, of which he had been the first Teacher, should be afterwards preached by the apostles. </p></div>
