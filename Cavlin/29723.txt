<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>For which I have been appointed</em>. That it may not be thought that he makes rash assertions — as many are wont to do — on a subject which he did not well understand, he affirms that God had appointed him for this purpose, that he might bring the Gentiles, who had formerly been alienated from the kingdom of God, to have a share in the gospel; for his apostleship was a sure foundation of the divine calling. And on this account he labors very hard in asserting it, as there are many who received it with no small difficulty. </p><p><em>I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie</em>. He employs an oath, or protestation, as in a matter of extraordinary weigh and importance, that he is <em>a teacher of the Gentiles, </em>and that <em>in faith and truth </em>These two things denote a good conscience, but still it must rest on the certainty of the will of God. Thus he means, that he preaches the gospel to the Gentiles, not only with pure affection, but also with an upright and fearless conscience; because he does nothing but by the command of God. </p></div>
