<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_26:62</span><strong>.</strong><em>And the high priest, rising up. </em>It is certain that Christ was <em>silent </em>when <em>false witnesses </em>pressed hard upon him, not only because they did not deserve a reply, but because he did not seek to be now acquitted, knowing that his hour was come. But Caiaphas triumphs over him on account of his silence, as if he was struck dumb by being vanquished; which is usually the case with men who are conscious of having done wrong. But it is an instance of extreme wickedness that he insinuates that Christ is not free from blame, because <em>witnesses </em>speak against him. The question, <em>What is it that those men testify against thee? </em>amounts to this: “How comes it that those men oppose thee, but because they are urged by conscientious views? For they would not have appeared against thee without a good reason.” As if he did not know that those <em>witnesses </em>had been procured by fraud: but this is the way in which wicked men, when they find themselves in the possession of authority and power, throw off sham and indulge in arrogance. Christ was again silent, not only because the objection was frivolous, but because, having been appointed to be a sacrifice, he had thrown aside all anxiety about defending himself. </p></div>
