<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13</strong><em>The daughter of the King is all glorious within </em><span class="cite-ref">(172)</span> This verse may be understood in a twofold sense; either as meaning that the queen, not only when she appears in public before all the people, but also when sitting in private in her own chamber, is always sumptuously apparelled; or, that the splendor and gorgeous appearance of her attire is not merely a thing of display, designed to dazzle the eyes of the simple, but consists of expensive and really substantial material. The prophet accordingly enhances the happy and lofty condition of the queen by the circumstance, that she has not only sumptuous apparel in which she may appear on particular occasions, but also for her ordinary and daily attire. Others expound it in this sense, That all her glory consists in the king inviting her familiarity into his presence; and this opinion they rest on the ground that immediately after there is a description given of her as passing into the chamber of the king accompanied with a great and glorious train of followers. This display of pomp exceeds the bounds of due moderation; but, in the meantime, we are taught by it, that while the Church is thus richly apparelled, it is not designed to attract the notice of men, but only for the pleasure of the King. If in our day the Church is not so richly adorned with that spiritual beauty in which the glory of Christ shines forth, the fault ought to be imputed to the ingratitude of men, who either through their own indifference despise the goodness of God, or else, after having been enriched by him, again fall into a state of poverty and want. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(172)</span> Dathe and Berlin refer <em>within </em>to the interior of the queen’s palace, which seems to agree best with the context. The original word rendered <em>within </em>denotes <em>the interior of a house </em>in <span class="bvs">Lev_10:18</span>, and <span class="bvs">1Kg_6:18</span>. Fry explains the words thus: “<em>Most splendid is the royal daughter within </em>the awning of her covered vehicle;” and refers to the picture of a bridal procession in Mr Lane’s Egypt. Dr Geddes reads: — </p><p>“All glorious is the queen in her apartment,<LineBreak />Her robe is bespangled with gold;<LineBreak />To the king she shall be brought in brocade,<LineBreak />Attended by her virgin companions.” </p><p>“This,” says he, namely, verse 13th, “and the two next verses, contain a fine description of Oriental manners. The queen, before she be led to the king’s apartment, is gorgeously dressed in her own; and thence proceeds with her female train to the royal palace.” </p></div></div>
