<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah says, that he <em>called John and the other leaders of the forces and all the people, from the least to the greatest </em>This is expressed that we may know that it happened, not through the fault of one or two, that this prophecy was disregarded, but that all the people were united together. The people <em>themselves, </em>then, could not have pretended that they were free from blame; for we see that they were all implicated. The leaders are particularly mentioned, and on the other hand the people, so that the leaders could not object and say that they were forced by a popular tumult, nor could the people throw the blame on the leaders. The Prophet then shews that they all rebelled against God, and that there was no exception. </p></div>
