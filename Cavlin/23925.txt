<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>And love the first places at entertainments.. </em>He proves, by evident signs, that no zeal for piety exists in the <em>scribes, </em>but that they are wholly devoted to ambition. For to seek <em>the first places </em>and <em>the first seats </em>belongs only to those who choose rather to exalt themselves among men, than to enjoy the approbation of God. But above all, Christ condemns them for desiring to be called <em>masters; </em>for, though the name <em>Rabbi </em>in itself denotes excellence, yet at that time the prevailing practice among the Jews was, to give this name to the <em>masters </em>and <em>teachers </em>of the Law. But Christ asserts that this honor does not belong to any except himself; from which it follows that it cannot, without doing injury to him, be applied to men. But there is an appearance of excessive harshness, and even of absurdity, in this, since Christ does not now teach us in his own person, but appoints and ordains <em>masters </em>for us. Now it is absurd to take away the title from those on whom he bestows the office, and more especially since, while he was on earth, he appointed apostles to discharge the office of teaching in his name. </p><p>If the question be about the title, Paul certainly did not intend to do any injury to Christ by sacrilegious usurpation or boasting, when he declared that. he was </p><p>a master and teacher of the Gentiles, (<span class="bvs">1Ti_2:7</span>.) </p><p>But as Christ had no other design than to bring all, from the least to the greatest, to obey him, so as to preserve his own authority unimpaired, we need not give ourselves much trouble about the word. Christ therefore does not attach importance to the title bestowed on those who discharge the office of teaching, but restrains them within proper limits, that they may not rule over the kith of brethren. We must always attend to the distinction, that Christ alone ought to be obeyed, because concerning him alone was the voice of the Father heard aloud from heaven, <em>Hear him, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_17:5</span>;) and that teachers are his ministers in such a manner that he ought to be heard in them, and that they are <em>masters </em>under him, so far as they represent his person. The general meaning is, that his authority must remain entire, and that no mortal man ought to claim the smallest portion of it. Thus he is the only Pastor; but yet he admits many pastors under him, provided that he hold the preeminence over them all, and that by them he alone govern the Church. </p><p><em>And you are all brethren. </em>This opposite clause must be observed. For, since <em>we are brethren, </em>he maintains that no man has a right to hold the place of a <em>master </em>over others; and hence it follows, that he does not condemn that authority of <em>masters </em>which does not violate brotherly intercourse among the godly. In short, nothing else is here enjoined than that all should depend on the mouth of Christ alone. Nearly to the same purpose does Paul argue, when he says that we have no right to <em>judge </em>one another, for all are <em>brethren, </em>and </p><p>all must stand before the judgment seat of Christ,<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_14:10</span>.) </p></div>
