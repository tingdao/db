<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>He who has not spared his own son, etc. </em>As it greatly concerns us to be so thoroughly persuaded of the paternal love of God, as to be able to retain our rejoicing on its account, Paul brings forward the price of our redemption in order to prove that God favors us: and doubtless it is a remarkable and clear evidence of inappreciable love, that the Father refused not to bestow his Son for our salvation. And so Paul draws an argument from the greater to the less, that as he had nothing dearer, or more precious, or more excellent than his Son, he will neglect nothing of what he foresees will be profitable to us. <span class="cite-ref">(273)</span></p><p>This passage ought to remind us of what Christ brings to us, and to awaken us to contemplate his riches; for as he is a pledge of God’s infinite love towards us, so he has not been sent to us void of blessings or empty, but filled with all celestial treasures, so that they who possess him may not want anything necessary for their perfect felicity. To <em>deliver up </em>means here to expose to death. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(273)</span> [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] renders<span class="lang el-gr">χαρίσεται </span> by “donaret;” [<span class="bvs">Capellus </span>] more fully, “gratis donabit — will gratuitously give.” Christ himself, and everything that comes with or through him, is a favor freely bestowed, and not what we merit. This shuts out, as [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] observes, everything as meritorious on the part of man. All is grace. The “all things” include every thing necessary for salvation — every grace now and eternal glory hereafter. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
