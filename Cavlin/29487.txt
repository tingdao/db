<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>In the body of his flesh. </em>The expression is in appearance absurd, but the <em>body of his flesh </em>means that human body, which the Son of God had in common with us. He meant, therefore, to intimate, that the Son of God had put on the same nature with us, that he took upon him this vile earthly body, subject to many infirmities, that he might be our Mediator. When he adds, <em>by death</em>, he again calls us back to sacrifice. For it was necessary that the Son of God should become man, and be a partaker of our flesh, that he might be our brother: it was necessary that he should by dying become a sacrifice, that he might make his Father propitious to us. </p><p><em>That he might present us holy. </em>Here we have the second and principal part of our salvation — newness of life. For the entire blessing of redemption consists mainly in these two things, remission of sins, and spiritual regeneration. (<span class="bvs">Jer_31:33</span>.) What he has already spoken of was a great matter, that righteousness has been procured for us through the death of Christ, so that, our sins being remitted, we are acceptable to God. Now, however, he teaches us, that there is in addition to this another benefit equally distinguished — the gift of the Holy Spirit, by which we are renewed in the image of God. This, also, is a passage worthy of observation, as shewing that a gratuitous righteousness is not conferred upon us in Christ, without our being at the same time regenerated by the Spirit to the obedience of righteousness, as he teaches us elsewhere, that </p><p>Christ is made to us righteousness and sanctification. <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_1:30</span>.) </p><p>The <em>former </em>we obtain by a gratuitous acceptance; <span class="cite-ref">(319)</span> and the <em>latter </em>by the gift of the Holy Spirit, when we are made new creatures. There is however an inseparable connection between these two blessings of grace. </p><p>Let us, however, take notice, that this holiness is nothing more than begun in us, and is indeed every day making progress, but will not be perfected until Christ shall appear for the restoration of all things. For the Cœlestinians <span class="cite-ref">(320)</span> and the Pelagians in ancient times mistakingly perverted this passage, so as to shut out the gracious benefit of the remission of sins. For they conceived of a perfection in this world which could satisfy the judgment of God, so that mercy was not needed. Paul, however, does not by any means shew us here what is accomplished in this world, but what is the end of our calling, and what blessings are brought to us by Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(319)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par l’acceptation gratuite de Dieu, c’est a dire pource qu’il nous accepte et ha agreables</span>;” — “By God’s gratuitous acceptance, that is, because he accepts of us, and regards us with favor.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(320)</span> The followers of Cœlestius, who, along with Pelagius, held views subversive of the doctrine of original sin, the necessity of divine grace, and other doctrines of a kindred character. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
