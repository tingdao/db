<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose. </em>It is asked why God would have sacrifices offered to Him only on one altar? Besides the reason which I have lately advanced, it is not to be doubted but that He in this way had regard to believers, that He might cherish in them an agreement in the unity of the faith. This place, then, was like a standard to gather together the people, lest their religion should be torn by divisions, and lest any diversities should insinuate themselves. Moreover, God, by claiming His right and authority to choose the place, commends obedience, on which also the purity of worship depends. But, again, another question arises; because, before the time of David, the Ark had nowhere a fixed resting-place, but traveled about, as it were, to various lodgings, therefore, if the chosen place is understood to be Mount Zion, the people were free in the intermediate time to perform the sacrifices wherever they pleased. I reply, that the place was not, chosen until the Ark was placed in Zion; for not till then was fulfilled what is said in the Psalm, </p><p>"I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord; <LineBreak />our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_122:1</span>;) </p><p>in which words the Prophet intimates that there was before no resting-place, because God had not yet pointed out the place in which He would be worshipped. Therefore it is expressly said, “out of all your tribes,” or “in one of your tribes,” whereby a special privilege is referred to, which was to be conferred on one of their tribes, to the exclusion of the others. And to this relates what is said in another Psalm, </p><p>"Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved: and he built his sanctuary like high <em>palaces, </em>like the earth, which he hath established for ever.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_78:67</span>) </p><p>To the same effect the faithful elsewhere congratulate themselves, after the Ark was deposited with David, “We will go into his tabernacles, we will worship at his footstool;” and, on the other hand, the Spirit declares, </p><p>"The Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it ” (<span class="bvs">Psa_132:13</span>.) </p><p>Similar statements everywhere occur, confirming the opinion that the Ark never rested in its true home until it was deposited on Zion; and God, in my judgment, in order that He might keep the hope of His people in suspense, promised, although the Ark changed its place from time to time, that He had still determined on a perpetual abode in which it should rest. Yet it does not therefore follow that, up to that period, a free permission was given to the people to sacrifice wherever they would. For, wherever the sanctuary was, there was also a temporary choice of the place, until the legitimate resting-place was shewn them. Therefore God, chastising by Jeremiah the foolish confidence by which the Jews were puffed up, said, </p><p>"Go ye now unto my place, which was in Shiloh, <LineBreak />and see what I did to it,” etc., (<span class="bvs">Jer_7:12</span>;) </p><p>in which words he implies that Shiloh had been highly honored for a season, but had now been deprived of its honor, because the sacrifices had there been unworthily polluted. </p><p>Although, then, there is a special promise here concerning Zion, still there is no doubt but that God in the meantime confines the Jews to His sanctuary, lest any one should erect a private altar for himself, or build for himself other cities and other temples. The phrase is worthy of observation, “to put his name there;” and again, “his habitation.” The gross imaginations of men are thus obviated, lest the people should enclose God within walls, as they are wont to circumscribe His infinite essence, or to draw Him down from heaven, and to place Him beneath the elements of the world. But God’s name is said to inhabit a place, not in His own nature, but with reference to man; whilst, in deference to their ignorance, He sets before their eyes a visible symbol of His presence. Thus He is often said to “come down,” not as if He, who fills heaven and earth, actually moved, but because the familiar knowledge of Him brings Him near to men. But although He allows Himself to be invoked on earth, yet He would not have the minds of men rest there, but rather lifts them up on high as if by steps. Therefore, by Isaiah, He harshly chides them, because, although enwrapped in their sins, they still thought that He was under obligation to them because His temple was in their sight, (<span class="bvs">Isa_66:1</span>,) whereas it is our business to approach Him by faith and with serious feelings when He extends His hand to us. The Ark of the Covenant indeed is often called “His face;” but, lest men should form any gross or earthly conceptions of Him, the sanctuary is also called “His footstool." </p><p>The various kinds of oblations which are here enumerated will be hereafter more clearly explained. I will only briefly remind you that the burnt-offerings are included in the sacrifices, as a part is taken for the whole. The Hebrew word, which we have translated “the elevating of the hand,” is, <span class="lang he-il">תרומה</span>, <em>therumah, </em><span class="cite-ref">(104)</span> to which another word, <span class="lang he-il">תנופה</span>, <em>thenuphah, </em>is often added; but, although both are derived from the act of elevating, still they seem to differ, and those skilled in the language thus distinguish them, viz., that <span class="lang he-il">תרומה</span>, <em>therumah, </em>is to be lifted up, and then brought down; and, <span class="lang he-il">תנופה</span>, <em>thanuphah, </em>to be turned at the same time to the right and left, although others think it means to be turned round to the four quarters of the globe. There is a difference between vows and freewill-offerings; for although a vow is at first freely made, yet we may offer things which we have not vowed. I have already spoken of the firstlings. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(104)</span><span class="lang he-il">תרומה</span>, the heaving or elevating; <span class="lang he-il">תנופה</span>, the heaving or vibrating. <em>C.’s </em>translation of the first word is that of <em>S.M</em>. ; and his note on both is extracted from a note of <em>S.M. </em>on <span class="bvs">Exo_25:2</span>, where <span class="lang he-il">תרומה</span> occurs, and is rendered <em>offering </em>in the text of <em>A.V</em>. , but <em>heave-offering </em>in its margin. — <em>W </em></p></div></div>
