<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>Many which believed. </em>Luke bringeth forth one token of that fear whereof he spake. For they did indeed declare that they were thoroughly touched and moved with the fear of God, who, of their own accord, did confess the faults and offenses of their former life, lest, through their dissimulation, they should nourish the wrath of God within. We know what a hard matter it is to wring true confession out of those who have offended, for seeing men count nothing more precious than their estimation, they make more account of shame than of truth; yea, so much as in them lieth, they seek to cover their shame. Therefore, this voluntary confession was a testimony of repentance and of fear. For no man, unless he be thoroughly touched, will make himself subject to the slanders and reproaches of men, and will willingly be judged upon earth, that he may be loosed and acquitted in heaven. When he saith, <em>Many, </em>by this we gather that they had not all one cause, for it may be that these men had corrupt consciences a long time; as many are oftentimes infected with hidden and inward vices. Wherefore, Luke doth not prescribe all men a common law; but he setteth before them an example which those must follow who need like medicine. For why did these men confess their facts, save only that they might give testimony of their repentance, and seek counsel and ease at Paul’s hands? It was otherwise with those who came unto the baptism of John, confessing their sins ( <span class="bvs">Mat_3:6</span>). For by this means they did confess that they did enter into repentance without dissimulation.</p><p>But in this place Luke teacheth by one kind, after what sort the faithful were touched with the reverence of God, when God set before them an example of his severity. For which cause the impudence of the Papists is the greater, who color their tyranny by this fact. For wherein doth their auricular confession agree<span class="cite-ref">(375)</span> with this example? First, the faithful confessed how miserably they had been deceived by Satan before they came to the faith, bringing into the sight of men certain examples. But by the Pope’s law it is required that men reckon up all their words and deeds and thoughts. We read that those men confessed this once; the Pope’s law commandeth that it be repeated every year at least. These men made confession of their own accord; the Pope bindeth all men with necessity. Luke saith there came many, not all; in the Pope’s law there is no exception. These men humbled themselves before the company of the faithful; the Pope giveth a far other commandment, that the sinner confess his sins, whispering in the ear of one priest.<span class="cite-ref">(376)</span> Lo, how well they apply<span class="cite-ref">(377)</span> the Scriptures to prove their subtilities.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(375)</span></p><p>“ Quid enim... affine habet,” for what affinity has. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(376)</span></p><p>“Ut clanculariis susurris in aurem proprii sacerdotes obmurmuret peccator ,” that the sinner mutter secret whispers into the ear of his own priest. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(377)</span></p><p>“ Quam dextre accommodent,” how dexterously they accommodate. </p></div></div>
