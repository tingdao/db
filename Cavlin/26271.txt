<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And filled twelve baskets. </em>When <em>four thousand men </em>were fed by <em>seven loaves</em>, Matthew relates that the number of baskets filled with fragments was exactly the same with the number of the loaves, (<span class="bvs">Mat_15:37</span>.) Since, therefore, a smaller quantity is sufficient for a greater number of men, and since the quantity left is nearly double, hence we see more clearly of what value is that blessing of God, against the sight of which we deliberately shut our eyes. We ought also to observe, in passing, that though Christ commands them to <em>fill the baskets </em>for illustrating the miracle, yet he likewise exhorts his disciples to frugality, when he says, <em>Gather the fragments which are left, that nothing may be lost; </em>for the increase of the bounty of God ought not to be an excitement to luxury. Let those, therefore, who have abundance, remember that they will one day render an account of their immoderate wealth, if they do not carefully and faithfully apply their superfluity to purposes which are good, and of which God approves. </p></div>
