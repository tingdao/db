<div class="comment-content"><p>He adds, <em>Saying, No; for we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war, </em>etc. here the Prophet discovers the very fountain of rebellion, namely, that they paid no regard to God’s favor. They were indeed exposed to many dangers in their own land, which produced fear and trembling, and its desolation also might have filled them with horror and weariness; but as God had declared that their safety would be cared for by him, how great and how base an ingratitude it was to deem as nothing that aid which he had freely promised! The Prophet then, in condemning their disobedience, shews at the same time the cause of it, even that unbelief led them away from rendering obedience to God. <em>If</em>, then, <em>ye say, </em>No, — this word was a proof of their obstinacy; but he adds, <em>We shall go </em>into Egypt, <em>where we shall not see war, where we shall not hear the sound of the trumpet, </em>as though, indeed, the promise of God were false or void. But the Prophet here discovers their hidden impiety, that they did not recumb on God’s promise. They promised then to themselves a peaceable life in Egypt. Was it in their power to effect this? and God, what could he do? he had <em>declared </em>that they would be safe and secure in the land of Canaan. It was to charge God with falsehood, to hope for rest in Egypt, and to imagine nothing but disturbances in the land where God bade them to remain in quietness. </p><p>We now then see why he says, <em>We shall go into Egypt, where we shall not see war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor hunger for bread </em>They promised to themselves an abundance of all blessings, for the land of Egypt was fruitful. But could not God afflict them with want? The Egyptians, we know, had also been sometimes visited with famine. We hence see why God so much condemned the design of the people as to their going into Egypt; for they entertained vain hopes, and at the same time charged God indirectly with falsehood. </p></div>
