<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>I am the door. </em>If this explanation had not been added, the whole discourse would have been allegorical. He now explains more clearly what was the chief part of the parable when he declares that <em>he is the door </em>The amount of what is stated is, that the principal point of all spiritual doctrine, on which souls are fed, consists in Christ. Hence also Paul, one of the shepherds, says: </p><p>I reckon nothing to be worth knowing but Jesus Christ,<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_2:2</span>.) </p><p>And this mode of expression conveys the same meaning as if Christ had testified that to him alone we must all be gathered together. Therefore, he invokes and exhorts all who desire salvation to come to him. By these words, he means that in vain do they wander about who leave him to go to God, because there is but one open <em>door</em>, and all approach in any other way is prohibited. </p></div>
