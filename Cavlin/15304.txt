<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion above all the dwellings of Jacob. </em>Here we are taught that all the excellence of the holy city depended on the free choice which God had made of it. With this agrees what is stated in <span class="bvs">Psa_78:60</span>, that God rejected Shiloh, the tribe of Ephraim, and the tabernacle of Joseph, that he might dwell in Zion which he loved. The prophet then points out the cause why God preferred that one place before all others; and the cause which he assigns is, not the worth of the place itself, but the free love of God. If it is demanded why Jerusalem was so highly distinguished, let this short answer be deemed sufficient, <em>Because it so pleased God. </em>To this the divine love is to be traced as its source; but the end of such a choice was, that there might be some fixed place in which the true religion should be preserved, and the unity of the faith maintained, until the advent of Christ, and from which it might afterwards flow into all the regions of the earth. This, then, explains why the prophet celebrates Jerusalem as possessing the high distinction of having God for its master-builder, its founder and protector. Farther, he attributes to the divine favor and adoption whatever excellence it possessed above other places. In putting <em>Zion </em>for Jerusalem, and the <em>gates </em>for the whole compass of the city, there is a double synecdoche. </p></div>
