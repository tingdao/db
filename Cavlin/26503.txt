<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And it was the feast of Dedication. </em>The Greek word (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐγκαίνια</span>) which we have translated <em>dedication</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(298)</span> properly signifies <em>renovations</em>; because the temple, which had been polluted, was again consecrated by the command of Judas Maccabaeus; and at that time it was enacted that the day of the new <em>dedication </em>or <em>consecration </em>should be celebrated every year as a festival, that the people might recall to remembrance the grace of God, which had put an end to the tyranny of Antiochus. Christ appeared <em>in the temple </em>at that time, according to custom, that his preaching might yield more abundant fruit amidst a large assembly of men. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(298)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le mot Grec pour lequel nous avons mis Dedicace</span>.” </p></div></div>
