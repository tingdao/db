<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>Blessed be God </em>He begins (as has been observed) with this thanksgiving — partly for the purpose of extolling the goodness of God — partly, with the view of animating the Corinthians by his example to the resolute endurance of persecutions; and partly, that he may magnify himself in a strain of pious glorying, in opposition to the malignant slanderings of the false apostles. For such is the depravity of the world, that it treats with derision martyrdoms, <span class="cite-ref">(217)</span> which it ought to have held in admiration, and endeavours to find matter of reproach in the splendid trophies of the pious. <span class="cite-ref">(218)</span><em>Blessed be God, </em>says he. On what account? <em>who comforteth </em>us <span class="cite-ref">(219)</span> — the relative being used instead of the causal particle. <span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> He had endured his tribulations with fortitude and alacrity: this fortitude he ascribes to God, because it was owing to support derived from his consolation that he had not fainted. </p><p>He calls him the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ<em>, </em>and not without good reason, where blessings are treated of; for where Christ is not, <em>there </em>the beneficence of God is not. On the other hand, where Christ intervenes, </p><p>by whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Eph_3:15</span>,) </p><p><em>there </em>are all mercies and all consolations of God — nay, more, <em>there </em>is fatherly love, the fountain from which everything else flows. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(217)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Des martyres et afflictions des fideles</span>;” — “The martyrdoms and afflictions of believers.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(218)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Cherche matiere de mespris et diffamation aux enseignes magnifiques de victoire, lesquelles Dieu dresse à ses enfans</span>;” — “Seeks matter of contempt and defamation in those splendid tokens of victory, which God furnishes to His children.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(219)</span> “Who is comforting (<span class="lang el-gr">ὁ παρακαλῶν</span>) — that doth never cease to do it, that never withdraweth his consolations.
