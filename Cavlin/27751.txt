<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Calling unto him. </em>Paul was not so desirous of life, but he would have made haste to die, if the Lord had thought it good so to be; but because he knoweth that he serveth Christ upon that condition, that he may no less live than die to him, he doth not neglect to avoid the danger which was revealed to him. And though he be fully persuaded that God is the keeper of his life, yet he doth not wait until God put forth his hand out of heaven to work a miracle, but doth rather use the remedy which is offered him; nothing doubting but that it is appointed by God.</p><p>Thus must all the ministers of Christ deal, that being furnished with invincible constancy, so far as their calling requireth, they fear not danger, and yet that they cast not away themselves through rashness. Let them call upon the name of the Lord cheerfully, even amidst the pikes;<span class="cite-ref">(553)</span> and yet let them not contemn those helps which are offered; otherwise they shall be injurious to God, in that they are not only not moved with his promises,<span class="cite-ref">(554)</span> but also despise the means which he hath appointed for their deliverance.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(553)</span></p><p>“ In mediis augustiis,” in the midst of straits. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(554)</span></p><p>“ Ad ejus promissiones surdi,” deaf to his promises </p></div></div>
