<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>But when he shall have turned to the Lord. </em>This passage has hitherto been badly rendered, for both Greek and Latin writers have thought that the word Israel was to be understood, whereas Paul is speaking of Moses. He had said, that a <em>veil is upon the hearts </em>of the Jews, <em>when Moses is read</em>. He immediately adds, <em>As soon as he will have turned to the Lord, the veil will be taken away</em>. Who does not see, that this is said of Moses, that is, of the law? For as Christ is the end <span class="cite-ref">(407)</span> of it, (<span class="bvs">Rom_10:4</span>,) to which it ought to be referred, it was turned away in another direction, when the Jews shut out Christ from it. Hence, as in the law <span class="cite-ref">(408)</span> they wander into by-paths, so the law, too, becomes to them involved like a labyrinth, until it is brought to refer to its end, that is, Christ. If, accordingly, the Jews seek Christ in the law, the truth of God will be distinctly seen by them, <span class="cite-ref">(409)</span> but so long as they think to be wise without Christ, they will wander in darkness, and will never arrive at a right understanding of the law. Now what is said of the law applies to all Scripture — that where it is not taken as referring to Christ as its one aim, it is mistakingly twisted and perverted. <span class="cite-ref">(410)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(407)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La fin et l’accomplissement d’icelle</span>;” — “The end and accomplishment of it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(408)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En lisant la Loy</span>;” — “In reading the Law.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(409)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils y trouuerout clairement la pure verité de Dieu</span>;” — “They will clearly discover in it the pure truth of God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(410)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est la destourner hops de son droit sens et du tout la peruertir</span>;” — “This is to turn it away from its right meaning, and altogether to pervert it.” </p></div></div>
