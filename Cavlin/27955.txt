<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Who changed</em>, <em>etc. </em>He repeats what he had said before, though in different words, in order to fix it deeper in our minds. When the truth of God is turned to a lie, his glory is obliterated. It is then but just, that they should be besprinkled with every kind of infamy, who strive to take away from God his honor, and also to reproach his name. — </p><p><em>And worshipped</em>, <em>etc. </em>That I might include two words in one, I have given this rendering. He points out especially the sin of idolatry; for religious honor cannot be given to a creature, without taking it away, in a disgraceful and sacrilegious manner, from God: and vain is the excuse that images are worshipped on God’s account, since God acknowledges no such worship, nor regards it as acceptable; and the true God is not then worshipped at all, but a fictitious God, whom the flesh has devised for itself. <span class="cite-ref">(52)</span> What is added, <em>Who is blessed for ever</em>, I explain as having been said for the purpose of exposing idolaters to greater reproach, and in this way, “He is one whom they ought alone to have honored and worshipped, and from whom it was not right to take away any thing, no, not even the least.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(52)</span> The words, “the truth of God,” and “falsehood,” or, a lie, are Hebraistic in their meaning, signifying “the true God,” and “an idol.” The word, which means a lie, is often in Hebrew applied to any thing made to be worshipped. See <span class="bvs">Isa_44:17</span>, compared with <span class="bvs">Isa_44:20</span> [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] renders the sentence, “Who exchanged the true God for a false one.” [<span class="bvs">Wolfius </span>] objects to this view, and says, “I prefer to take<span class="lang el-gr">ἀλήθειαν τοῦ θεοῦ, </span><em>for the truth </em>made known by <em>God </em>to the Gentiles, of which see <span class="bvs">Rom_1:18</span>, and the following verses: they <em>changed </em>this into a<em>lie, i.e</em>. , into those insane and absurd notions, into which they were led by their<span class="lang el-gr">διαλογισμοῖς </span> — reasonings, <span class="bvs">Rom_1:21</span>.” The expression<span class="lang el-gr">— παρὰ τὸν κτίσαντα </span> has been rendered by [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>] <em>, </em>“above the creator,” by [<span class="bvs">Luther </span>] <em>, </em>“rather than the Creator;” by [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>], “to the neglect of the Creator — præterito conditore;” and by [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>], “in the place of the Creator.” The two last are more consonant with the general tenor of the context; for the persons here spoken of, according to the description given them, did not worship God at all<span class="lang el-gr">; παρὰ </span> is evidently used in the sense of exclusion and opposition<span class="lang el-gr">παρὰ τὸν νόμον </span> — contrary to the law, <span class="bvs">Act_18:13</span><span class="lang el-gr">; παρὰ φύσιν </span> — contrary to nature, <span class="bvs">Rom_1:26</span>.
