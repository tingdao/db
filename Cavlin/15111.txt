<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>The clouds poured out waters. </em>As the noun <span class="lang he-il">מים</span>, <em>mayim, </em>cannot be taken in the construct state, the verb, I have no doubt, is put transitively; but it makes little difference as to the sense, whether we take this view, or read as if <span class="lang he-il">מים</span>, <em>mayim, </em>were in the construct state and the verb passive; that is, whether we read, <em>The clouds poured out waters, </em>or, <em>The waters of the clouds were poured out. </em>The meaning obviously is, that not only the sea and the river Jordan, but also the waters which were suspended in the clouds, yielded to God the honor to which he is entitled, the air, by the concussion of the thunder, having poured forth copious showers. The object is to show, that, to whatever quarter men turn their eyes, the glory of God is illustriously manifested, that it is so in every part of creation, above and beneath, from the height of heaven to the depths of the sea. What history is here referred to is involved in some degree of uncertainty. <span class="cite-ref">(304)</span> Perhaps it is that which is recorded in <span class="bvs">Exo_9:23</span>; where we are informed, that hail mingled with thunder and lightning was one of the dreadful plagues inflicted upon the Egyptians. <em>The arrows which went abroad </em>are, no doubt, to be taken metaphorically for lightnings. With this verse we are to connect the following, in which it is said, that <em>the voice of the thunder was heard in the air, and that the lightnings illumined the world, so that the earth trembled </em>The amount is, that at the departure of the people from Egypt, ample testimony was borne to the power of God, both to the eyes and the ears of men; peals of thunder having been heard in every quarter of the heavens, and the whole sky having shone with flashes of lightning, while at the same time the earth was made to tremble. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(304)</span> As in the three preceding verses the deliverance of the chosen people from Egypt, and the drying up of the Red Sea, to make a way for them to pass through, are the subjects celebrated, it is very natural to suppose that the 17<span class="cite-ref">th</span> and 18<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verses refer to the tempestuous rain, the thunder, lightning, and earthquake, by which God testified his wrath against the Egyptians, and by which that ruthless host were filled with dismay, when they went into the midst of the Red Sea after the Israelites. Of these particular circumstances, we have indeed no distinct information in the narrative of Moses; but from a comparison of what is here stated, with what is said in <span class="bvs">Exo_14:24</span>, “And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,” it seems highly probable that they took place on that occasion. With this corresponds the representation given by Josephus of this part of Jewish History. “As soon as ever the whole Egyptian army was within it, the sea flowed to its own place, and came down with a torrent raised by storms of wind, and encompassed the Egyptians. Showers of rain also came down from the sky, and dreadful thunders and lightning, with flashes of fire. Thunder-bolts also were darted upon them; nor was there any thing which used to be sent by God upon men, as indications of his wrath, which did not happen at that time; for a dark and dismal night oppressed them.” — <em>Antiquities of the Jews</em>, Book II. chapter 16, section 3. </p></div></div>
