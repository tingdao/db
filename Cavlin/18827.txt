<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Then shalt thou see. </em>These things appear, at first sight, to be somewhat inconsistent with each other, that formerly he spoke of the fact as present, and now foretells it as future. But formerly he spoke of the eyes of faith, which beholds those things which do not fall under the senses of men, and now he speaks of the actual event; or, at least, he intended by the present tense to point out the certainty; but now, in order that believers may continue to exercise patience, he limits the same statement. Besides, although those things which the Lord promises are concealed, for a time, from the eyes of men, yet believers perceive them by faith; so that they have a firm belief and expectation of the accomplishment of them, however incredible they may appear to others. </p><p><em>Thou shalt shine, </em>or, <em>thou shalt overflow. </em>As the verb <span class="lang he-il">נהר</span> (<em>nahar</em>) signifies both “to shine” and “to overflow,” so it may be rendered either way. <span class="cite-ref">(152)</span> We may refer it to that joy with which the Church is filled and overflows, when it is enlarged in this manner, or to the ornament with which it shines and dazzles. <span class="cite-ref">(153)</span></p><p><em>Thou shalt tremble. </em>He now mentions “trembling,” and connects it with splendor or joy; and this may appear to be inconsistent with the meaning assigned to the former clause. But I have no doubt that he intended, by this word, to express the astonishment and even amazement with which the Church shall be seized, when she shall perceive that this strange and unexpected honor has been obtained by her, and that she has been elevated to so high a rank of honor. As if he had said, “The extent of the work will be so great as to exceed thy expectation.” It is not, therefore, the “trembling”’ which is produced by some danger or some melancholy event, but such as commonly arises in matters of great importance, which exceed the capacity of our understanding, when we are struck with amazement, and almost think that we dream, and this “trembling” agrees very well with joy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(152)</span> “As to <span class="lang he-il">נהר</span>, (<em>nahar</em>,) the difficulty is in choosing between its two admitted senses of ‘flowing,’ (<span class="bvs">Isa_2:2</span>) and of ‘shining,’ (<span class="bvs">Psa_34:5</span>) The former is preferred by Jerome, who translates it <em>afflues </em>; by Junius and Tremellius, who have <em>conflues </em>; and by the English and Dutch versions, the latter of which refers it to the confluence of crowds produced by any strange occurrence. Vitringa makes it mean to <em>flow out</em>, and Lowth to <em>overflow </em>with joy. But all the latest writers of authority give the word the same sense as in <span class="bvs">Psa_34:5</span>, which is well expressed by Henderson in strong though homely English, <em>thou shalt look and brighten up</em>. ” — <em>Alexander </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(153)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui la fait reluire</span>.” “Which causes it to shine.” </p></div></div>
