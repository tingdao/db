<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>47.</strong><em>To all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. </em>Christ now discovers clearly what he had formerly concealedâ€”that the grace of the redemption brought by him extends alike <em>to all nations. </em>For though the prophets had frequently predicted the calling of the Gentiles, still it was not revealed in such a manner that the Jews could willingly admit the Gentiles to share with them in the hope of salvation. Till his resurrection, therefore, Christ was not acknowledged to be any thing more than the Redeemer of the chosen people alone; and then, for the first time, was <em>the wall of partition </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_2:14</span>) thrown down, that they who had been <em>strangers, </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_2:19</span>,) and who had formerly been scattered, might be gathered into the fold of the Lord. In the meantime, however, that the covenant of God might not seem to be made void, Christ has assigned to the Jews the first rank, enjoining the apostles to <em>begin at Jerusalem. </em>For since God had peculiarly adopted the posterity of Abraham, they must have been preferred to the rest of the world. This is the privilege of the firstborn which Jeremiah ascribes to them, when Jehovah says, <em>I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is first-born, </em>(<span class="bvs">Jer_30:9</span>.) This order, too, Paul everywhere observes with the greatest care, telling us that Christ <em>came and proclaimed peace to those who were near, </em>and afterwards to strangers who were <em>at a distance, </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_2:17</span>.) </p></div>
