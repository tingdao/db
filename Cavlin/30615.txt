<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>No man hath seen God </em>The same words are found in <span class="bvs">Joh_1:18</span> of Johnâ€™s Gospel; but John the Baptist had not there exactly the same thing in view, for he meant only that God could not be otherwise known, but as he has revealed himself in Christ. The Apostle here extends the same truth farther, that the power of God is comprehended by us by faith and love, so as to know that we are his children and that he dwells in us. </p><p>He speaks, however, first of love, when he says, that <em>God dwells in us, if we love one another; for perfected, </em>or <em>really proved to be</em>, <em>in us is then his love</em>; as though he had said, that God shews himself as present, when by his Spirit he forms our hearts so that they entertain brotherly love. For the same purpose he repeats what he had already said, that we know by the Spirit whom he has given us that he dwells in us; for it is a confirmation of the former sentence, because love is the effect or fruit of the Spirit. </p><p>The sum, then, of what is said is, that since love is from the Spirit of God, we cannot truly and with a sincere heart love the brethren, except the Spirit puts forth his power. In this way he testifies that he dwells in us. But God by his Spirit dwells in us; then, by love we prove that we have God abiding in us. On the other hand, whosoever boasts that he has God and loves not the brethren, his falsehood is proved by this one thing, because he separates God from himself. </p><p>When he says, <em>and his love is perfected</em>, the conjunction is to be taken as a causative, <em>for</em>, or, <em>because </em>And <em>love </em>here may be explained in two ways, either that which God shews to us, or that which he implants in us. That God has given his Spirit to us, or given us of his Spirit, means the same thing; for we know that the Spirit in a measure is given to each individual. </p></div>
