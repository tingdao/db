<div class="comment-content"><p>I have observed, that in the second verse a more than ordinary ardor of desire is expressed. The first verb, <span class="lang he-il">כספ</span>, <em>casaph, </em>signifies <em>vehemently to desire; </em>but not contented with this word, David adds, that <em>his soul fainteth after the courts of the Lord, </em>which is equivalent to our pining away, when, under the influence of extreme mental emotion, we are in a manner transported out of ourselves. He speaks only of the <em>courts </em>of the tabernacle, because, not being a priest, it was not lawful for him to go beyond the outer court. None but the priests, as is well known, were permitted to enter into the inner sanctuary. In the close of the verse, he declares, that this longing extended itself even to his body, that is, it manifested itself in the utterance of the mouth, the languor of the eyes, and the action of the hands. The reason why he longed so intensely to have access to the tabernacle was, to enjoy <em>the living God; </em>not that he conceived of God as shut up in so narrow a place as was the tent of the ark, <span class="cite-ref">(458)</span> but he was convinced of the need he had of steps, by which to rise up to heaven, and knew that the visible sanctuary served the purpose of a ladder, because, by it the minds of the godly were directed and conducted to the heavenly model. And assuredly, when we consider that the sluggishness of our flesh hinders us from elevating our minds to the height of the divine majesty, in vain would God call us to himself, did he not at the same time, on his part, come down to us; or, did he not at least, by the interposition of means, stretch out his hand to us, so to speak, in order to lift us up to himself. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(458)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme estort le pavillon de l’Arche</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
