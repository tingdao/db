<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Some believed. </em>Luke declareth that this was at length the success of the disputation, that they did not all profit<span class="cite-ref">(682)</span> in the same doctrine. We know that the apostle was endued with such grace of the Spirit, that he ought to have moved stones; and yet he could not, after long disputing and testifying, win all men unto Christ. Wherefore, let us not marvel, if the unbelief of many do at this day resist the plain doctrine of the gospel, and if many remain obstinate, to whom the truth of Christ is no less made manifest than the sun at noon-day. Moreover, those return from Paul blind and blockish, who came unto him willingly, as if they had been desirous to learn. If there were such stubbornness in voluntary hearers, what marvel is it if those refuse Christ with a malicious<span class="cite-ref">(683)</span> mind, who swell with pride and malice, [bitterness] and do openly fly and hate the light? </p><p><strong>(682)</strong></p><p>“ Pariter,” equally. </p><p><strong>(683)</strong></p><p>“ Amarulento,” bitter. </p></div>
