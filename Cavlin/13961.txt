<div class="comment-content"><p>The copulative <em>and </em>should be resolved into the disjunctive particle but, because David employs language full of confidence, in opposition to the hardihood and profane scoffings of his enemies, <span class="cite-ref">(39)</span> and testifies that whatever they may say, he would nevertheless rely upon the word of God. It besides appears that he had previously entertained an assured hope of deliverance, from the circumstance of his here making no mention of his present calamity as a chastisement inflicted upon him by the hand of God; but rather depending upon the divine aid, he courageously encounters his enemies, who were carrying on an ungodly and wicked war against him, seeing they intended to depose a true and lawful king from his throne. In short, having acknowledged his sin before, he now takes into consideration only the merits of the present cause. And thus it becomes the servants of God to act when molested by the wicked. Having mourned over their own sins, and humbly betaken themselves to the mercy of God, they ought to keep their eyes fixed on the obvious and immediate cause of their afflictions, that they may entertain no doubt of the help of God when undeservedly subjected to evil treatment. Especially when, by their being evil entreated, the truth of God is opposed, they ought to be greatly encouraged, and glory in the assurance that God without doubt will maintain the truth of his own promises against such perfidious and abandoned characters. Had it been otherwise with David, he might seem to have claimed these things to himself groundlessly, seeing he had deprived himself of the approbation and help of God by offending him. <span class="cite-ref">(40)</span> But being persuaded that he was not utterly cut off from the favor of God, and that God’s choice of him to be king remained unchanged, he encourages himself to hope for a favorable issue to his present trials. And, in the first place, by comparing God to <em>a shield, </em>he means that he was defended by his power. Hence also he concludes, that God <em>was his glory, </em>because he would be the maintainer and defender of the royal dignity which he had been pleased to confer upon him. And, on this account, he became so bold that he declares he would walk with unabashed brow. <span class="cite-ref">(41)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(39)</span><span class="lang fr-fr">L’audace de ses ennemis et risee accompagnee de sacrilege</span>. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(40)</span><span class="lang fr-fr">En l’offensant</span>. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(41)</span><span class="lang fr-fr">De la procede l’asseurance dont il fait mention puis apres qu’il marchera hardiment la teste levee</span>. — <em>Fr</em>.
