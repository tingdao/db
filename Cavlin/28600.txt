<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>Even as I please all men in all this </em>As he speaks in a general way, and without exception, some extend it by mistake to things that are unlawful, and at variance with the word of the Lord — as if it were allowable, for the sake of our neighbor, to venture farther than the Lord permits us. It is, however, more than certain, that Paul accommodated himself to men only in things indifferent, and in things lawful in themselves. Farther, the end must be carefully observed — <em>that they may be saved </em>Hence what is opposed to their salvation ought not to be conceded to them, <span class="cite-ref">(607)</span> but we must use prudence, and that of a spiritual kind. <span class="cite-ref">(608)</span></p><p><strong>(607)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">I1 ne leur faut pas accorder, et s’accommoder a eux en cela</span>;” — “It is not proper to concede to them, and to accommodate ourselves to them in that.” </p><p><strong>(608)</strong> The view here given by Calvin of the spirit by which Paul was actuated in this part of his conduct, is most successfully brought out, at greater length, by the Reverend Andrew Fuller, when comparing <span class="bvs">1Co_10:33</span>, with <span class="bvs">Gal_1:10</span>. — “Though both these kinds of action are expressed by one term — to <em>please </em>— <em>yet </em>they are exceedingly diverse; no less so than a conduct which has the glory of God and the good of mankind for its object, and one that originates and terminates in self. The former of these passages should be read in connection with what precedes and follows it, (<span class="bvs">1Co_10:31</span>.) Hence it appears plain, that the <em>things </em>in which the Apostle <em>pleased all</em>, <em>men</em>, require to be restricted to such things as tend to their ‘profit, that they may be sav<em>ed</em>. ’ Whereas the things in which, according to the latter passage, he could <em>not </em>please men, and yet be the servant of Christ, were of a contrary tendency. Such were the objects pursued by the false teachers whom he opposed, and who desired to ‘make a fair show in the flesh, lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.’ (<span class="bvs">1Co_6:12</span>.) The <em>former </em>is that sweet inoffensiveness of spirit which teaches us to lay aside all selfwill and self-importance, that charity which ‘seeketh not her own,’ and ‘is not easily provoked;’ it is that spirit, in short, which the same writer elsewhere recommends from the example of Christ himself: ‘We, then, who are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbor, for his good to edification: for even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.’ But the <em>l </em>a<em>tter </em>spirit referred to is that sordid compliance with the corruptions of human nature, of which flatterers and deceivers have always availed themselves, not for the glory of God or the good of men, but for the promotion of their own selfish designs.” — <em>Fullers Works</em>, volume 3. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
