<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>For I will have respect unto you </em><span class="cite-ref">(211)</span> God is said to “turn Himself” to the people, whom He undertakes to cherish and preserve; just as also when He forsakes those who have alienated themselves from Him, He is said to be turned away from them. Hence the common exhortation in the Prophets, “Be ye turned to me, and I will be turned to you;” whereby God reminds us that He has not promised in vain what we here read. Therefore the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, to confirm His covenant towards them by watching for their safety. Hence, too, we are also taught, that when we depart from God, His covenant is made void by our own fault; wherewith Jeremiah reproaches the Israelites. (<span class="bvs">Jer_31:32</span>.) In order, therefore, that God’s covenant should remain firm and effectual, it is not only necessary that the Law should be engraven on our hearts, but also that He should add another grace, and not remember our iniquities. When He says, “Ye shall eat old store,” He again magnifies their abundance; for, whereas scarcity compels us to make immediate use of the new fruits, so it is a great sign of abundance to bring forth old wheat from the granary, and old wine from the cellar. The continuance of His bounty is represented in the end of the verse, where He says that there shall be no place for the new fruits, unless they empty their store-houses; because <span class="cite-ref">(212)</span> it might happen that, after a year of scarcity, all their storehouses should be empty, and there would be no new corn to succeed in place of the old. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(211)</span> Literally, “I will turn myself to you.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(212)</span> This last sentence omitted in <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
