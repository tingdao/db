<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Be as I am</em>. Having till now spoken roughly, he begins to adopt a milder strain. The former harshness had been more than justified by the heinousness of the offense; but as he wished to do good, he resolves to adopt a style of conciliation. It is the part of a wise pastor to consider, not what those who have wandered may justly deserve, but what may be the likeliest method of bringing them back to the right path. He must “be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine.” (<span class="bvs">2Ti_4:2</span>.) Following the method which he had recommended to Timothy, he leaves off chiding, and begins to use entreaties. <em>I beseech you</em>, he says, and calls them<em>brethren</em>, to assure them that no bitterness had mingled with his reproofs. </p><p>The words, <em>be as I am</em>, refer to the affection of the mind. As he endeavors to accommodate himself to them, so he wishes that they would do the like by him in return. <em>For I am as ye are</em>. “As I have no other object in view than to promote your benefit, so it is proper that you should be prevailed on to adopt moderate views, and to lend a willing, obedient ear to my instructions.” And here again pastors are reminded of their duty to come down, as far as they can, to the people, and to study the various dispositions of those with whom they have to deal, if they wish to obtain compliance with their message. The proverb still holds: “to be loved, you must be lovely.” </p><p><em>Ye have not injured me at all</em>. This is intended to remove the suspicion which might have rendered his former reproofs more disagreeable. If we think that a person is speaking under a sense of injury, or revenging a private quarrel, we turn away our minds from him entirely, and are sure to torture whatever he says into an unfavourable interpretation. Paul therefore meets the rising prejudice by saying, “So far as respects myself, I have no cause to complain of you. It is not on my own account, nor from any hostility to you, that I feel warmly; and therefore, if I use strong language, it must arise from some other cause than hatred or anger.” </p></div>
