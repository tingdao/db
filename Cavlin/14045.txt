<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>For the ungodly praiseth himself. </em>This verse is variously explained. Literally the reading is, <em>For praiseth the wicked or ungodly; </em>and it is therefore necessary to supply some word, but what word is disputed. <span class="cite-ref">(196)</span> Some translate the words, <em>ungodly </em>and <em>violent man, </em>in the accusative case, thus: <em>He praiseth the ungodly, and blesseth the violent man; </em>because they think it strange that after “praiseth” the sentence should end abruptly, without any thing being said of who or what was praised. But since it is quite common in Hebrew, when the agent and the subject are one and the same person, to express the word only once, while we repeat it in order to complete the sense, the interpretation which I have followed appears to me the most proper, namely, that the ungodly man praises himself, and boasts of the desire of his soul, and blesses himself. Now, it may be asked, What is <em>this desire of soul? </em>It is usually understood in this sense, <span class="cite-ref">(197)</span> that the ungodly flatter and applaud themselves, while fortune smiles on them, and they obtain their wishes, and enjoy whatever they desire; just as David adds, a little after, that they abuse their prosperity, in attempting whatever comes into their fancy. But, in my opinion, <em>desire of soul </em>here denotes rather lust, and the intemperate gratification of passion and appetite; and thus the meaning is, that they indulge themselves with delight in their depraved desires, and, despising the judgment of God, fearlessly absolve themselves from all guilt, maintain their innocence, <span class="cite-ref">(198)</span> and justify their impiety. Moses uses a similar form of expression in <span class="bvs">Deu_29:19</span>, </p><p>“I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart.” </p><p>David, indeed, says a little after, that the ungodly abuse their prosperity, by flattering themselves; but here, in my judgment, he expresses something more weighty, namely, that they acquire praise from their presumptuousness, and glory in their wickedness; and this foolish confidence, or bold assurance, is the cause of their throwing off all restraint and breaking forth into every kind of excess. Accordingly, I interpret the words <em>praise </em>and <em>bless </em>as having the same meaning, just as the words, <em>ungodly </em>and <em>violent man, </em>are synonymous in this place, although they differ from each other as genus and species. With these statements agrees what is immediately added in the end of the verse that these ungodly persons <em>despise God. </em>To translate the verb, <em>to blaspheme, </em>as has been done by some, or <em>to provoke to anger, </em>as has been done by others, is too remote from the scope of the passage. David rather teaches, that the cause of their careless indulgence in the gratification of their lusts, is their base contempt of God. He who duly reflects that God will be his judge is so much alarmed by this reflection, that he dares not bless his soul while his conscience accuses him of guilt and of being given to the practice of sin. <span class="cite-ref">(199)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(196)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il y a mot en mot, Car louis le meschant et il y faut, suppleer quelque petit mot: or, cela on y besongne diversement</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(197)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">On la repete pour patnaire le sense</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(198)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Es s’osent bien absoudre et tenir pour innocens</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(199)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Cependant qu’il se sent coulpable et adonne k mM faire</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
