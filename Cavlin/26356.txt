<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>But we know whence this man is. </em>Here we see not only how great is the blindness of men, when they ought to judge about the things of God, but this vice is almost natural to them, to be ingenious in contriving what may hinder them from arriving at the knowledge of the truth. It is frequently, indeed, from the craft of Satan that offenses arise, which cause many to turn away from Christ; but though the road were plain and smooth, every man would contrive an offense for himself. So long as the rulers were opposed to Christ, their unbelief would of itself have kept back this multitude; but when that obstacle has been removed, they contrive a new reason for themselves, that they may not come to the faith. And even though it were proper that they should be influenced by the example of their rulers, they are so far from following what is right, that they willingly stumble at the first step. Thus it frequently happens, that men who had begun well fall away quickly, unless the Lord conduct them to the very end of their career. </p><p><em>But when Christ shall come. </em>The argument by which they obstruct their own progress is this: “The Prophets have testified that the origin of Christ will be unknown. Now <em>we know whence this man is</em>, and therefore we cannot reckon him to be <em>the Christ</em>. ” Hence we are reminded how pernicious it is to mangle the Scriptures, and even Christ himself, so as not to admit more than the half of him. God promised that the Redeemer would be of the seed of David; but he frequently claims this office as peculiar to himself; therefore, he must have been God manifested in the flesh, that he might be the Redeemer of his Church. Thus Micah points out the place where Christ would be born. <em>Out of thee</em>, <em>Bethlehem</em>, he says, <em>a Prince shall come</em>, <em>to govern my people </em>But, immediately afterwards, he speaks of another <em>going forth </em>which is far loftier, and then he says that it is hidden and secret, (<span class="bvs">Mic_5:2</span>.) Yet those wretched men, when they perceived in Christ nothing but what is liable to contempt, draw the absurd conclusion, that he is not the person who had been promised. On the mean condition of Christ in the flesh let us therefore learn to look in such a manner, that this state of humiliation, which is despised by wicked men, may raise us to his heavenly glory. Thus <em>Bethlehem</em>, where the man was to be born, will be to us a door by which we may enter into the presence of the eternal God. </p></div>
