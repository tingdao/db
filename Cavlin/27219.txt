<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>As he was in the way. </em>In craving epistles of the high priest, he ran headlong against Christ willingly; and now he is enforced to obey whether he will or no. This is surely the most excellent mercy of God, in that that man is reclaimed unto salvation contrary to the purpose of his mind, whom so great a heat carried headlong into destruction. Whereas the Lord suffereth him to receive letters, and to come near to the city; (whereby we see how well he knoweth the very instants of times to do everything in due time; <span class="cite-ref">(570)</span>) he could have prevented him sooner, if it had seemed good to him so to do, that he might deliver the godly from fear and carelessness. <span class="cite-ref">(571)</span> But he setteth out his benefits more thereby, in that he tieth the jaws of the greedy wolf, even when he was ready to enter the sheepfold. Also we know that men’s stubbornness increaseth more and more by going forward. Wherefore the conversion of Paul was so much the harder, forasmuch as he was already made more obstinate by continuing his fury. </p><p><em>Shined about him. </em>Because it was no easy matter to pull down <span class="cite-ref">(572)</span> so great pride to break such a lofty courage, to pacify such a blind heat of wicked zeal, and, finally, to bridle a most unbridled beast, Christ must needs have showed some sign of his majesty, whereby Paul might perceive that he had to do with God himself, and not with any mortal man;. although there were some respect had of humbling him, (because he was unworthy to have Christ,) to accustom him by and by to obey, by laying upon his neck the meek and sweet yoke of his Spirit. And he was scarce capable of so great gentleness, until his cruelty might be broken. <span class="cite-ref">(573)</span> Man’s sense cannot comprehend the Divine glory of Christ as it is; but as God did oftentimes put upon him forms wherein he did show himself, so Christ did now declare and make manifest his divinity to Paul, and showed some token of his presence, that he might thereby terrify Paul. For although the godly be afraid and tremble at the seeing of God, yet it must needs be that Paul was far more afraid when as he perceived that the divine power of Christ was set full against him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(570)</span> “Oppportune,” opportunely. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(571)</span> “Anxietate,” anxiety. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(572)</span> “Domare,” to tame. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(573)</span> “Violenter fracta,” forcibly broken. </p></div></div>
