<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Jehovah! </em>It was a sign of uncommon virtue in David, that even this hard treatment could not shake his mind, and sink him into despondency. He informs us of the means by which he fortified himself against that terrible stumbling-block. When the wicked directed against him their witty and scoffing remarks, as if engines of war, to overthrow his faith, the means to which he had recourse for repelling all their assaults was pouring out his heart in prayer to God. He was constrained to keep silence before men, and, being thus driven out from the world, he betook himself to God. In like manner, although the faithful in the present day may be unable to make any impression upon the wicked, yet they will ultimately triumph, provided they retire from the world, and go directly to God to present their prayers before him. The meaning, in short, is, that David, having tried every means in his power, and finding that his labor was to no purpose, left off dealing with men, and dealt with God only. What follows, <em>a time of thy favor, O God! </em>is explained otherwise by many interpreters, who read the two clauses of the verse in one sentence, thus: <em>But as for me, I prayed to God in a time of his favor; </em>corresponding to that passage in <span class="bvs">Isa_55:6</span>, “Call ye upon him while he is near.” Others resolve it thus: <em>I prayed that the time of favor might come, and that God would begin to be merciful to me. </em>But David is rather speaking of the consolation which he then received by reflecting with himself, that although it was now a time of trouble with him, and although his prayers seemed to be altogether unavailing, yet God’s favor would have its turn also. Thus the Prophet Habakkuk says, </p><p>“I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will <LineBreak />watch to see what he will say unto me.” (<span class="bvs">Hab_2:1</span>) </p><p>In like manner, Isaiah says, </p><p>“I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob;” (<span class="bvs">Isa_8:17</span>) </p><p>and <span class="bvs">Jer_14:22</span>,) “We will wait upon thee.” The only means by which, in our affliction, we can obtain the victory, is by our having hope shining in us in the midst of darkness, and by our having the sustaining influence which arises from waiting for the favor of God. After David has thus fortified himself for continued perseverance in the attitude of waiting, he immediately adds, <em>Answer me in the multitude of thy goodness; </em>and to <em>goodness </em>he joins <em>the truth of salvation, </em><span class="cite-ref">(81)</span> intimating that God’s mercy is proved by indubitable effect when he succours his servants who are reduced to the very depths of despair. What prompted him to present this prayer was, the full persuasion which he had, that the darkness in which he was now involved would in due time be dispelled, and that a serene and unclouded season of God’s favor would succeed; a persuasion which arose from his recalling all his thoughts to God, lest he should faint by reason of the harassing treatment which he met with from the wicked. </p><p><strong>(81)</strong> Dr Wells explains, <em>the truth of thy salvation</em>, as meaning, “according to the promises thou hast made of saving me.” </p></div>
