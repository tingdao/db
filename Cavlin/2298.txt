<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And these are the garments. </em>Here again I must remind my readers, that they should abandon all subtle speculations, and be contented with simplicity. I might repeat many plausible allegories, which perhaps would find more favor with some than a sound knowledge of facts. If any should delight in this kind of child’s play, let him only read what <em>Jerome </em>wrote to <em>Fabiola; </em>in which he collected almost everything that he possibly could from the writings of others; but nothing will be found except dull trifling, the folly of which it is painful even to report, much more to refute. Those who are conversant with my writings, are aware that I do not willingly find fault with the opinions of others; but when I reflect how dangerous are those itching ears, with which many are troubled, I am obliged to prescribe this remedy. Six principal parts of the dress are enumerated. What the Greeks call the <span class="lang el-gr">λογεῖον</span>, and the Latins the <em>pectorale, </em>was like a square breastplate attached by small chains, so as to be connected with the ephod. Inclosed in it were twelve stones to represent the tribes of Israel; and the Urim and Thummim were also annexed to it. But what its form might be, cannot be certainly declared from the words of Moses; and since even the Jews also differ among themselves, let us be satisfied with its comparison to a breastplate. I have no objection to the opinion, that its name <span class="cite-ref">(162)</span> was derived from <em>strength, </em>or a <em>treasure. </em>But this is worthy of the utmost attention, that the priest bore the sons of Abraham as it were upon his heart, not only that he might present them to God, but that he might be mindful of them, and anxious for their welfare. The twelve precious stones were by no means given to be symbols of the twelve tribes as a cause for awakening their pride, as if they were so highly esteemed on the score of their own dignity or excellence; but they were thus reminded that the whole value, in which believers are held by God, is derived from the sanctity of the priesthood. Therefore, let us learn from this figure, that:, however vile and abject we may be in ourselves, and so altogether worthless refuse, yet inasmuch as Christ deigned to ingraft us into this body, in Him we are precious stones. And to this Isaiah seems to allude in the passage before cited, where, speaking of the restoration of the Church, which was to take place under the reign of Christ, he says, “Behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires; and I will make thy windows with carbuncles, and all thy borders with pleasant stones;” for immediately after the exposition follows, “And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_54:11</span>.) Therefore what was to be fulfilled in Christ, was typified by the external sign under the Law; viz., that though we sojourn in the world, yet are we united with Christ by faith, as if we were one with Him; and, besides, that He takes care for our welfare, as if He bore us enclosed in His heart; and, finally, that when our heavenly Father regards us in Him, He esteems us above all the wealth and splendor of the world. </p><p>As to the Urim and Thummim, it appears probable to me that they were two conspicuous marks on the breastplate, corresponding to these names; for the supposition of some of the Jews, <span class="cite-ref">(163)</span> that the ineffable name of God was placed beneath its texture, is not free from foolish and dangerous superstition. I pass over other fancies, which are equally frivolous; nor am I anxious to know what was the form of either of them; the fact itself is sufficient for me. By the <em>Urim, </em>therefore, or <em>splendors, </em>I doubt not but that the light of doctrine, wherewith the true Priest illuminates all believers, was represented; first, because He is the one “light of the world,” without which all things are full of darkness; and because in Him “are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_8:12</span>; <span class="bvs">Col_2:3</span>.) Hence did Paul justly glory that he knew nothing but Jesus Christ, (<span class="bvs">1Co_2:2</span>,) since His priesthood sufficiently and more than sufficiently enlightens us. As then the people were admonished that their eyes should be directed to the splendor of the priest, so now we must diligently remember what Christ Himself teaches, that “he that followeth him shall not walk in darkness.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_8:12</span>.) On the other hand, the <em>Thummim, </em>which signifies <em>perfections, </em>was a symbol of the perfect and entire purity which is only to be sought in Christ; for He would not have been a meet high priest unless He had been perfect, free from every spot, and deficient in nothing which is required unto complete holiness. It is not, then, an improper distinction, that the <em>Urim </em>refers to the light of doctrine, and the <em>Thummim </em>to the life; and this is indeed in some measure applicable to the pastors of the Church, who ought to shine both in sound doctrine and in integrity of life. But it was God’s design to shew that neither of these things is to be sought anywhere except in Christ; since from Him we obtain both light and purity, when He deigns to make us partakers of them according to the measure of His free bounty. Whence it follows, that they who seek for the least spark of light or drop of purity out of Christ, plunge themselves into a labyrinth, where they wander in mortal darkness, and inhale the deadly fumes of false virtues unto their own destruction. </p><p>What the Scripture sometimes relates, as to the inquiries made by <em>Urim </em>and <em>Thummim, </em>it was a concession made by God to the rudeness of His ancient people. The true Priest had not yet appeared, the Angel of His Almighty counsel, by whose Spirit all the Prophets spoke, who, finally, is the fountain of all revelations, and the express image of the Father; in order then that the typical priest might be the messenger from God to man, it behooved him to be invested with the ornaments of Christ. Thus even then believers were taught in a figure, that Christ is the way by which we come to the Father, and that He also brings from the secret bosom of His Father whatever it is profitable for us to know unto salvation, hence that fiction of the Jews is contradicted, that the responses were given in this way: if a question was asked respecting a particular tribe, that the stone which represented it was lighted up; and that the colors of the stones were changed according as God refused or assented. For even if we allow that the Urim and Thummim were the rows of precious stones themselves, still this imagination is altogether unmeaning. But, as I have said, by the very form of the breastplate God would testify that the fulness of wisdom and integrity was contained in it; for which reason it is called “the breastplate of judgment,” <em>i.e., </em>of the most perfect rectitude, which left nothing to be desired; for the word <span class="lang he-il">משפט</span><em>mishphot, </em>often signifies in Scripture whatsoever is well and duly ordered. The interpretation which some give, that “judgment” means “inquiry,” because the priest only asked for responses when he had the breastplate on, is too restricted, and is even proved to be erroneous by sundry passages. Let this then be deemed settled, that this honorable appellation is meant to express a correct and infallible rule (<em>ordinem.</em>) Because the breastplate was, as it were, a part of the ephod, it is therefore sometimes comprehended in that word; in which it may be well also to observe, that this peculiar ephod of the high priest’s was different from the others, of which mention is made elsewhere; for all of the sacerdotal lineage wore an ephod in the performance of religious duties. (<span class="bvs">1Sa_14:3</span>.) Even David, when he danced before the Ark, wore his ephod, (<span class="bvs">2Sa_6:14</span>;) and this custom is still retained by the <em>Jews </em>at their chief festivals. The rest I will introduce presently in their proper places. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(162)</span> The Hebrew name of the breastplate, viz., <span class="lang he-il">חשן</span>, is a word whose root has not been preserved in the <em>Heb. </em>But in the Arabic its root signifies <em>elegant, </em>or <em>adorned with beauty, </em>according to Simon’s Lexicon. There is no discoverable reason for its signifying <em>strength, or a treasure. </em>—<em>W. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(163)</span> “R. <em>Salomon </em>thinketh, that the Urim and Thummim was nothing else but the name of Jehovah, which was written in letters and put within the breastplate; which name some ancient Hebrews, even before Christ, did take to signifie the Trinitie. In this word, <span class="lang he-il">יהוה</span> Jehovah, they would have the first letter <em>yod, </em>taken for the Father; <em>he, </em>for the Son, which letter is doubled to signifie his two natures, the humane and divine; and <em>vau, </em>which is a conjunctive copulative, signifieth the Holy Ghost. — <em>Vatab</em>. But between these words, Urim and Thummim, and the name Jehovah, there seemeth to be small affinitie.” — Willet <em>in loco. </em></p></div></div>
