<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu</em>. Before Moses erected the tabernacle and consecrated it by a solemn ceremony, it was necessary for him to fetch the Tables of the Covenant, which were a pledge of God’s favor; otherwise, if the ark had nothing in it, the sanctuary would have been in a manner empty. For this reason, he is commanded to go up into the mount, but not without a splendid train of companions, in order that an appropriate preparation might arouse their minds for a fit reception of this especial blessing. He is, therefore, commanded to take with him Aaron his brother, and Nadab and Abihu, together with seventy of the elders of the people. This was the number of witnesses selected to behold the glory of God. Before, however, they ascended the mount, a sacrifice was offered by the whole people, and the Book of the Law was read. Finally, Moses alone was received into the top of the mount, to bring from thence the Tables written by the hand of God. </p><p>Here, however, (See this subject further discussed on <span class="bvs">Num_11:16</span>, <em>infra</em>.) arises a question respecting the seventy elders; for we shall see elsewhere that the seventy were not chosen till the people had departed from Mount Sinai; whereas mention is made of them here, before the promulgation of the Law, which seems to be by no means consistent. But this difficulty is removed, if we allow, what we gather from this passage, that, even before they came to Mount Sinai, each tribe had appointed its governors (<em>praefectos</em>), who would make up this number, since there were six of every tribe; but that when Moses afterwards desired to be relieved of his burdens, part of the government was transferred <span class="cite-ref">(305)</span> to these seventy persons, since this number was already sanctioned by custom and use. Certainly, since it is plainly stated that there were <span class="cite-ref">(306)</span> seventy from the very first, it is probable that this number of coadjutors was given to Moses in order to make as little change as possible. For we know that, when a custom has obtained, men are very unwilling to depart from it. But it might have also been that the desire and intention of the Israelites was thus to celebrate the memory of their origin; for seventy persons had gone down into Egypt with Jacob, and, in less than two hundred and twenty years after they went there, their race had increased to six hundred thousand, besides women and children. It is not, therefore, contrary to probability that seventy persons were appointed to preside over the whole people, in order that so marvelous a blessing of God might continue to be testified in all ages, as if to trace the commencement of their race up to its very source. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(305)</span> “A ceux, qui desia estoyent en degre d’honneur;” to those who were already honourably distinguished. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(306)</span> “Septante et deux;” seventy-two. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
