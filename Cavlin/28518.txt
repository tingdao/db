<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>And they that use this world </em>In the <em>first </em>clause there is the participle <span class="lang el-gr">χρώμενοι</span> (<em>using</em>,) in the <em>second</em>, there is a compound of it — <span class="lang el-gr">καταχρώμενοι</span> (<em>abusing</em>.) Now the preposition <span class="lang el-gr">κατα</span> in a compound state is generally taken in a bad sense, or at least denotes intensity. <span class="cite-ref">(426)</span> Paul, therefore, directs us to a sober and frugal use of things, such as may not impede or retard our course, but may allow of our always hastening forward toward the goal. </p><p><em>For the fashion of this world passeth away </em>By the term here used, the Apostle has elegantly expressed the vanity of the world. “There is nothing,” says he, “that is firm or solid; <span class="cite-ref">(427)</span> for it is a mere show or outward appearance, as they speak.” He seems, however, to have had an allusion to theatrical representations, in which, on the curtain being drawn up in a single moment, a new appearance is presented, and those things that held the eyes of the spectators in astonishment, are immediately withdrawn from their view. I do not see why it is that Erasmus has preferred the term <em>habitus </em> (form.) He certainly, in my opinion, obscures Paul’s doctrine; for the term <em>fashion </em>is tacitly opposed to substance. <span class="cite-ref">(428)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(426)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tellement que le mot signifie yci, Abusans, ou Vsans trop</span>;” — “So that the word means here abusing, or using too much.” The verb <span class="lang el-gr">καταχράομαι</span>, is frequently made use of by classical writers to mean <em>using to the uttermost</em>, <em>using up</em>, or <em>misusing </em>See <em>Dem </em>430, 10, and <em>Lys </em>153, 46. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(427)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En ce monde</span>;” — “In this world.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(428)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme s’il disoit, que ce monde n’ha point vn estre, mais seulement vne monstre et vaine apparence</span>;” — “As if he had said, that this world has not an existence, but only a show and mere appearance.” </p></div></div>
