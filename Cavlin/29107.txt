<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>He therefore that ministereth</em>. He is not now speaking of the grace of regeneration, but of the other gifts of the Spirit; for a subject different from the preceding one is manifestly introduced. He warns them that all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, in which they excelled, are the fruits of the gospel, of that gospel which had been preached among them by his own lips. Their new teachers deprived them of those gifts when they left the gospel, and fled to another kind of doctrine. In proportion to the value which they attached to those gifts, to which the apostle here adds <em>miracles</em>, they ought the more carefully and resolutely to adhere to the gospel. </p></div>
