<div class="comment-content"><p>He then subjoins, <em>Do they provoke me, and not rather to the shame of their own faces? </em>God here intimates, that however reproachfully the Jews acted towards him, they yet brought no loss to him, for he stood in no need of their worship. Why then does he so severely threaten them? Because he had their sins in view: but yet he shews that he cared not for them nor their sacrifices, for he could without any loss be without them. Hence he says, that they sought their own ruin, and whatever they devised would fall on their own heads. They seek to provoke me; they shall know with whom they have to do.” It is like what is said by the Prophet Zechariah, “They shall know whom they have pierced: I indeed continue uninjured; and though they provoke me as much as they can, I yet despise all their wickedness, for they cannot reach me; they can neither hurt me nor take anything from me.” But he says, <em>they provoke themselves, </em>that is, their fury shall return on their own heads; and hence it shall be, that <em>their faces </em>shall be ashamed. <span class="cite-ref">(203)</span></p><p><strong>(203)</strong> The verb rendered “provoke,“ means to disturb, to disquiet, to cause an annoyance, to irritate, — </p><p>Is it I they are annoying, saith Jehovah? Is it not themselves, to the confusion of their own faces? </p><p>They were not disturbing, as it were, the repose of God, but their own. They could do no hurt or annoyance to God, but they were annoying and injuring themselves; and this would turn out to their own shame and confusion. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
