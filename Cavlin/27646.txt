<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>I have kept back nothing. </em>He commendeth his faithfulness and diligence in teaching in three respects, that he instructed his scholars thoroughly and perfectly, so that he omitted nothing which might make for their salvation; that being not content with general preaching, he did also endeavor to do every man good. Thirdly, he reciteth a brief sum of all his whole doctrine, that he exhorted them unto faith in Christ and repentance. Now, forasmuch as he depainteth out unto us a pattern of a faithful and good teacher, whosoever they be who are desirous to prove their industry to the Lord, they must set before their eyes the edifying of the Church, as he commandeth Timotheus in another place, to consider what things be profitable, that he may be instant in delivering those things ( <span class="bvs">1Ti_4:7</span>). And surely the Scripture (according to whose rule all manner of teaching must be examined, yea, which is the only method of teaching aright) doth not contain profound<span class="cite-ref">(417)</span> speculations, to delight men when they have nothing else to do;<span class="cite-ref">(418)</span> but as the same Paul doth testify, it is all profitable to make the man of God perfect.</p><p>But Paul prescribeth such a desire to edify, that the pastor must omit nothing, so much as in him lieth, which is profitable to be known. For they be bad masters who do so keep their scholars in the first principles, that they do never come unto the knowledge of the truth ( <span class="bvs">Tit_3:7</span>). And surely the Lord doth not teach us in his word only to [by] halves, (as they say) but he delivereth perfect wisdom, and such as is in all points absolute. Whereby it appeareth how impudently those men boast themselves to be ministers of the word, who do not only cloak and foster the ignorance of the people with their silence, but do also wink at gross errors and wicked superstitions; as at this day in Papistry, many send out some sparks of sound doctrine, but they<span class="cite-ref">(419)</span> dare not drive away the darkness of ignorance, and whereas the wicked fear of the flesh doth hinder them, they pretend that the people is not capable of sound<span class="cite-ref">(420)</span> doctrine.</p><p>Indeed, I confess that all things cannot be taught at one time, and that we must imitate Paul’s wisdom, who did apply himself unto the capacity of the ignorant. But what moderation is this when they suffer the blind to fall into the ditch, when they leave miserable souls under the tyranny of antichrist, and whereas they see idolatry rage, the worship of God corrupt, his law broken, and, finally, all holy things profaned, they do either with silence pass over such filthy confusion, or else they show it underhand, sparingly and obscurely, like men that be afraid? Therefore, we must note Paul’s word, when as he saith that he kept back nothing, but did show whatsoever things were profitable for the people; for by this we gather that the pure and free<span class="cite-ref">(421)</span> profession of sound doctrine is required at the hands of the servants of Christ, wherein there must be no boughts nor crooks, and that nothing is more unseemly in them than oblique insinuations, and such as are inwrapped in crafty dissimulation.</p><p><em>Publicly, and throughout every house. </em>This is the second point, that he did not only teach all men in the congregation, but also every one privately, as every man’s necessity did require. For Christ hath not appointed pastors upon this condition, that they may only teach the Church in general in the open pulpit; but that they may take charge of every particular sheep, that they may bring back to the sheepfold those which wander and go astray, that they may strengthen those which are discouraged and weak, that they may cure the sick, that they may lift up and set on foot the feeble,<span class="cite-ref">(422)</span> ( <span class="bvs">Eze_34:4</span>) for common doctrine will oftentimes wax cold, unless it be holpen with private admonitions.</p><p>Wherefore, the negligence of those men is inexcusable, who, having made one sermon, as if they had done their task, live all the rest of their time idly; as if their voice were shut up within the church walls, seeing that so soon as they be departed, thence they be dumb. Also, disciples and scholars are taught, that if they will be numbered in Christ’s flock, they must give place to their pastors, so often as they come unto them; and that they must not refuse private admonitions. For they be rather bears than sheep, who do not vouchsafe to hear the voice of their pastor, unless he be in the pulpit; and cannot abide to be admonished and reproved at home, yea, do furiously refuse<span class="cite-ref">(423)</span> that necessary duty.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(417)</span></p><p>“ Argutas,” subtle, </p><p><span class="cite-note">(418)</span></p><p>“ Sub umbra et in otio,” when at ease under the shade. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(419)</span></p><p>“ Plerique,” the greater part. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(420)</span></p><p>“ Solidioris,” more solid. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(421)</span></p><p>“ Ingenuam,” candid. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(422)</span></p><p>“ Debiles et infirmas,” the feeble and infirm. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(423)</span></p><p>“ Ferociter repellunt,” fiercely repel. </p></div></div>
