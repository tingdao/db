<div class="comment-content"><p>It now follows, <em>And destroyed shall be the high places of Isaac, and overthrown shall be the sanctuaries </em>(some render <em>palaces) of Israel; and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. </em>The Prophet here distinctly declares, that the people in vain trusted in their temples and superstitions, for by these they kindled the more against themselves the wrath of God. He would not indeed have expressly threatened the high places and the temples, unless the Israelites had provoked in this way, as I have already said, the vengeance of God against themselves, inasmuch as they had corrupted the true and lawful worship of God. </p><p><em>Destroyed then shall be the high places of Isaac </em>It may be asked, Why does he mention here the name of Isaac, which is rarely done by the Prophets? And there is also a change of one letter; for the word Isaac is commonly written with <span class="lang he-il">ץ</span>, <em>tsade</em>, but here it is written with <span class="lang he-il">ש</span>, <em>shin</em>; but it is well known that <span class="lang he-il">ש</span>, <em>shin </em>and <span class="lang he-il">ץ</span>, <em>tsade, </em>are interchangeably used. It is, however, beyond dispute, that the Prophet speaks here of the holy man Isaac; and the reason seems to be plainly this, — because the Israelites absurdly pretended to imitate their father in their superstitions; for temples, we know, had been erected where Isaac had worshipped God, and also their father Abraham and Jacob. Inasmuch then as the Israelites boasted of the examples of holy fathers, the Prophet here condemns this vain and false boasting. They who understand by the word Isaac, that the Prophet threatens the Idumeans as well as the Israelites, have no reason for their opinion; but the reason which I have already mentioned is quite sufficient. </p><p>We indeed know, that the Israelites had ever in their mouths the examples of the fathers, like the woman of Samaria, who said to Christ, ‘Our fathers worshipped in this mountain,’ (<span class="bvs">Joh_4:20</span>) So also the Israelites were wont formerly to allege, that the holy patriarchs worshipped God in those places, — that God appeared in Bethel to holy Jacob, and also that in other places altars were built. Being armed with the examples of the fathers, they thought them to be their shield. The case is the same with the Papists in our day; when they hear of anything as having been done by the fathers, they instantly lay hold on it; but these are vain excuses. Like them were also the Israelites; hence the Prophet says, “Behold, ye gain nothing by this fallacious pretense; for <em>destroyed shall be the high places of Isaac, </em>even those which are now covered by an honorable name: and at the same time the temples or palaces of Israel shall be overthrown. </p><p><em>And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword </em>We learn from this last clause that things were then, as we have stated elsewhere, in a prosperous state in the kingdom of Israel, though God had in various ways wasted it before Jeroboam: but they had been ever obstinate. He afterwards restored them to a better condition; for the state of the people greatly improved under Jeroboam: he recovered many cities enlarged the borders of his kingdoms and then the people, in their affluence began to grow wanton against God. As then the Prophet thus saw that they abused God’s goodness, he denounced destruction on Jeroboam; hence he says, <em>Against the house of Jeroboam I will rise up with the sword; </em>that is, “I will begin to execute my judgment on the offspring of the king himself; though I may spare him, yet his posterity shall not escape my hand.” </p></div>
