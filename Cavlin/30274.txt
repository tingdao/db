<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>A double-minded man</em>, or, <em>a man of a double mind</em>. This sentence may be read by itself, as he speaks generally of hypocrites. It seems, however, to me to be rather the conclusion of the preceding doctrine; and thus there is an implied contrast between the simplicity or liberality of God, mentioned before, and the double-mindedness of man; for as God gives to us with a stretched out hand, so it behooves us in our turn to open the bosom of our heart. He then says that the unbelieving, who have tortuous recesses, are <em>unstable</em>; because they are never firm or fixed, but at one time they swell with the confidence of the flesh, at another they sink into the depth of despair. <span class="cite-ref">(102)</span></p><p><strong>(102)</strong> “The double-minded,” or the man with two souls, <span class="lang el-gr">δίψυχος</span>, means here no doubt the man who hesitates between faith and unbelief, because faith is the subject of the passage. When again used, in <span class="bvs">Jas_4:8</span>, it means a hesitation between God and the world. </p></div>
