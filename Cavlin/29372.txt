<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Filled with the fruits of righteousness</em>. This now belongs to the outward life, for a good conscience produces its fruits by means of works. Hence he desires that they may be fruitful in good works for the glory of God. Such fruits, he says, are by Christ, because they flow from the grace of Christ. For the beginning of our well-doing is, when we are sanctified by his Spirit, for he rested upon him, that we might all receive of his fullness. (<span class="bvs">Joh_1:16</span>.) And as Paul here derives a similitude from trees, we are <em>wild olive-trees, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_11:24</span>,) and unproductive, until we are ingrafted into Christ, who by his living root makes us fruitbearing trees, in accordance with that saying, (<span class="bvs">Joh_15:1</span>,) <em>I am the vine, ye are the branches. </em>He at the same time shews the end — that we may promote the glory of God. For no life is so excellent in appearance as not to be corrupted and become offensive in the view of God, if it is not directed towards this object. </p><p>Paul’s speaking here of works under the term <em>righteousness</em>, is not at all inconsistent with the gratuitous righteousness of faith. For it does not immediately follow that there is righteousness wherever there are the fruits of righteousness, inasmuch as there is no righteousness in the sight of God, unless there be a full and complete obedience to the law, which is not found in any one of the saints, though, nevertheless, they bring forth, according to the measure, the good and pleasant <span class="cite-ref">(50)</span> fruits of righteousness, and for this reason, that, as God begins righteousness in us, through the regeneration of the Spirit, so what is wanting is amply supplied through the remission of sins, in such a way that all righteousness, nevertheless, depends upon faith. </p><p><strong>(50)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Bons et aimables</span>;” — “Good and amiable.” </p></div>
