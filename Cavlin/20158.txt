<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah continues here the same subject, but more clearly expresses what he had said, <em>Flee</em>, he says, <em>depart far away </em>What follows I read as a parenthesis, <em>Deep have they made to dwell, the inhabitants of Hazor </em>Then Jeremiah proceeds with his subject, <em>because consulted against you has Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon</em>, etc. He then bids them to <em>flee </em>to a distance, because Nebuchadnezzar had resolved to destroy them. By <em>counsel </em>and <em>thought </em>or purpose, the Prophet means the secret means by which he subdued the people when they feared no such thing. As then these shepherds lived securely on their mountains, Nebuchadnezzar prepared his forces, and divided them; and thus were these taken by his counsel and craft less than by strength. What the Prophet says here of the <em>counsel </em>and <em>device </em>of Nebuchadnezzar is not superfluous, because he indirectly touched on the sloth of that nation, who exercised no vigilance and thought, their desert being a sufficient cover to them. As then they thus lived securely, the Prophet here reminds them that they would have to do with a cunning enemy, who would contrive and form his counsels at home, and then would execute in due time what he had long meditated. </p><p>But a parenthesis follows, <em>Deep have they made</em>; to make more clear the sense, an adversative particle must be considered as understood, <em>Though deep have they made to dwell; </em>for without this exception the prophecy would have been less credible. For Kedareans were on every side fortified, because no one envied them, as they were not only frugal men, but also barbarous and contented with an austere and wretched living. As then they thought themselves thus safe, some one might have raised this objection and said, “Why dost thou bid them to flee? wherefore should they flee? for there is no one so foolish as to attack them.” So also the Scythians laughed at Alexander when he attacked them. “What is your object? you think that you have to do with men; we are wild beasts: and then if you seek wealth and riches, you will not find them with us.” Such then was the state of those nations mentioned here. When, therefore, the Prophet bids them to flee, because Nebuchadnezzar would suddenly attack them, he at the same time adds, <em>Though deep have they made to dwell </em><span class="cite-ref">(46)</span> He had before used this mode of speaking: to make deep to dwell, means to have a safe and hidden standing, remote from all danger. They are then said to be deep in their dwellings who dwell in fortified cities, or who inhabit deserts, or who are hid in some poor country, as the Kedareans and their neighbors. But the Prophet says, that this would not prevent the Babylonians from invading their land, and taking possession of it. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(46)</strong> This verb is deemed by most to be in the imperative mood, like the two foregoing verbs; and it is so given in the <em>Sept., </em>the <em>Vulg., </em>and the <em>Targ. </em>In the <em>Syr</em>. , all the verbs are in the past tense, which is not consistent with the context. <em>Blayney’s </em>version is, — </p><p>Flee ye, move off apace, Retire deep for to dwell, etc. </p><p>The meaning is, as he says, that they should go into deep caverns to hide themselves from their enemies.
