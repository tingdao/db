<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>For this cause ought the woman to have power </em><span class="cite-ref">(628)</span> From that authority he draws an argument <span class="cite-ref">(629)</span> in favor of outward decorum. “She is subject,” says he, “let her then wear a token of subjection.” In the term <em>power</em>, there is an instance of metonymy, <span class="cite-ref">(630)</span> for he means a token by which she declares herself to be under the power of her husband; and it is a covering, whether it be a robe, or a veil, <span class="cite-ref">(631)</span> or any other kind of covering. <span class="cite-ref">(632)</span></p><p>It is asked, whether he speaks of <em>married </em>women exclusively, for there are some that restrict to <em>them </em>what Paul here teaches, on the ground that it does not belong to virgins to be under the authority of a husband. It is however a mistake, for Paul looks beyond this — to God’s eternal law, which has made the female sex subject to the authority of men. On this account all women are born, that they may acknowledge themselves inferior in consequence of the superiority of the male sex. Otherwise it were an inconclusive argument that Paul has drawn from <em>nature</em>, in saying that it were not one whit more seemly for a woman to <em>have her head uncovered </em>than to be <em>shaven </em>— this being applicable to virgins also. </p><p><em>Because of the angels </em>This passage is explained in various ways. As the Prophet <span class="bvs">Mal_2:7</span> calls priests <em>angels of God</em>, some are of opinion that Paul speaks of <em>them</em>; but the ministers of the word have nowhere that term applied to them by itself — that is, without something being added; and the meaning would be too forced. I understand it, therefore, in its proper signification. But it is asked, why it is that he would have women have their heads covered <em>because of the angels </em>— for what has this to do with them? Some answer: “Because they are present on occasion of the prayers of believers, and on this account are spectators of unseemliness, should there be any on such occasions.” But what need is there for philosophizing with such refinement? We know that angels are in attendance, also, upon Christ as their head, and minister to him. <span class="cite-ref">(633)</span> When, therefore, women venture upon such liberties, as to usurp for themselves the token of authority, they make their baseness manifest to the angels. This, therefore, was said by way of amplifying, as if he had said, “If women uncover their heads, not only Christ, but all the angels too, will be witnesses of the outrage.” And this interpretation suits well with the Apostle’s design. He is treating here of different ranks. Now he says that, when women assume a higher place than becomes them, they gain this by it — that they discover their impudence in the view of the angels of heaven. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(628)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Doit auoir sur la teste vne enseigne qu’elle est sous puissance</span>;” — “She ought to have upon her head a token that she is under authority.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(629)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vn argument et consequence</span>;” — “An argument and inference.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(630)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">I1 y a de mot a mot au Grec, La femme doit auoir puissance sur la teste.
