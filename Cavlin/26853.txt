<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished. </em>John purposely passes by many things which are related by the other three Evangelists. He now describes the last act, which was an event of the greatest importance.When John says that <em>a vessel was placed there, </em>he speaks of it as a thing that was customary. There has been much controversy on this subject; but I agree with those who think (and, indeed, the custom is proved by histories) that it was a kind of beverage usually administered for the purpose of accelerating the death of wretched malefactors, when they had undergone sufficient torture <span class="cite-ref">(176)</span> Now, it ought to be remarked, that Christ does not ask any thing to <em>drink </em>till <em>all things have been accomplished; </em>and thus he testified his infinite love towards us, and the inconceivable earnestness of his desire to promote our salvation. No words can fully express the bitterness of the sorrows which he endured; and yet he does not desire to be freed from them, till the justice of God has been satisfied, and till he has made a perfect atonement. <span class="cite-ref">(177)</span></p><p>But how does he say, that all things were accomplished, while the most important part still remained to be performed, that is, his death? Besides, does not his resurrection contribute to the <em>accomplishment </em>of our salvation? I answer, John includes those things which were immediately to follow. Christ had not yet died: and had not yet risen again; but he saw that nothing now remained to hinder him from going forward to death and resurrection. In this manner he instructs us, by his own example, to render perfect obedience, that we may not think it hard to live according to his good pleasure, even though we must languish in the midst of the most excruciating pains. </p><p><em>That the Scripture might be fulfilled. </em>From what is stated by the other Evangelists, (<span class="bvs">Mat_27:48</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_15:23</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_23:36</span>,) it may readily be concluded that the passage referred to is <span class="bvs">Psa_69:21</span>, </p><p>They gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. </p><p>It is, undoubtedly, a metaphorical expression, and David means by it, not only that they refused to him the assistance which he needed, but that they cruelly aggravated his distresses. But there is no inconsistency in saying that what had been dimly shadowed out in David was more clearly exhibited in Christ: for thus we are enabled more fully to perceive the difference between truth and figures, when those things which David suffered, only in a figurative manner, are distinctly and perfectly manifested in Christ. To show that he was the person whom David represented, Christ chose to drink <em>vinegar; </em>and he did so for the purpose of strengthening our faith. </p><p><em>I thirst. </em>Those who contrive a metaphorical meaning for the word <em>thirst, </em>as if he meant that, instead of a pleasant and agreeable beverage, they gave him bitterness, as if they intended to flay his throat, <span class="cite-ref">(178)</span> are more desirous to be thought ingenious than to promote true edification; and, indeed, they are expressly refuted by the Evangelist, who says that Christ asked for vinegar when he was near death; from which it is evident that he did not desire any luxuries. <span class="cite-ref">(179)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(176)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">On dispute diversement de ceci; mais je m’accorde a l’opinion de ceux qui disent (comme aussi I’llsage enest approuvee par les histoires) que e’estoit une sorte de bruvage, duquel coustumierement on usoit pour avaneer la mort des poures malfaiteurs, apres qu’ils avoyent este assez tormentez</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(177)</span> The French copy gives an additional clause to this sentence: — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme s’il s’estoit oublid jusqu’k ce qu’ayant satisfait au payement de nos offenses, il declare qu’il n’est pas insensible, mais que l’amour qu’il nous portoit a surmontd toutes les angoisses</span>;” — “As if he had forgotten his own concerns till he had given full satisfaction for our sins, he declares that he is not incapable of feeling, but that the love which he bore to us rose superior to all the pains which he endured.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(178)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme s’il vouloit dire qu’au lieu de bruvage doux et aimable, on luy a donna de l’amertume, cornroe pour lug escorcher le gosicr</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(179)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En quoy fi’ appert qu’il n’estoit question de nulles, delices</span>.” </p></div></div>
