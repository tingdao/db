<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>For he hath looked down from the high place of his holiness </em>Now the prophet contemplates the deliverance after which he breathes with anxious desire, as if it had been already accomplished. That the malignity of men might not attempt to obscure such a signal blessing of Heaven, he openly and in express terms claims for God his rightful praise; and the people were constrained in many ways to acknowledge therein the divine hand. Long before they were dragged into captivity, this calamity had been foretold, that when it took place the judgment of God might be clearly manifested; and at the same time deliverance had been promised them, and the time specified to be after the lapse of seventy years. The ingratitude of men therefore could not devise or invent any other cause to which to ascribe their return but the mere goodness of God. Accordingly, it is said, that <em>God looked down from heaven, </em>that the Jews might not attribute to the grace and favor of Cyrus the deliverance which evidently proceeded from Heaven. <em>The high place of his holiness </em>or <em>sanctuary </em>is here equivalent to heaven. As the temple, in some parts of Scripture, (<span class="bvs">Psa_26:8</span> and <span class="bvs">Psa_76:2</span>) is called “the habitation of God,” in respect of men, so, that we may not imagine that there is any thing earthly in God, he assigns to himself a dwelling-place in heaven, not because he is shut up there, but that we may seek him above the world. </p></div>
