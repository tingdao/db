<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>The working of delusion</em>. He means that errors will not merely have a place, but the wicked will be blinded, so that they will rush forward to ruin without consideration. For as God enlightens us inwardly by his Spirit, that his doctrine may be efficacious in us, and opens our eyes and hearts, that it may make its way thither, so by a righteous judgment he delivers over to a <em>reprobate mind </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_1:28</span>) those whom he has appointed to destruction, that with closed eyes and a senseless mind, they may, as if bewitched, deliver themselves over to Satan and his ministers to be deceived. And assuredly we have a notable specimen of this in the Papacy. No words can express how monstrous a sink of errors <span class="cite-ref">(682)</span> there is <em>there</em>, how gross and shameful an absurdity of superstitions there is, and what delusions at variance with common sense. None that have even a moderate taste of sound doctrine, can think of such monstrous things without the greatest horror. How, then, could the whole world be lost in astonishment at them, were it not that men have been struck with blindness by the Lord, and converted, as it were, into stumps? </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(682)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quel monstrueux et horrible retrait d’erreurs</span>;” — “What a monstrous and horrible nest of errors.” </p></div></div>
