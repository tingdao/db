<div class="comment-content"><p>He adds, <em>The princes of Judah </em>and <em>the princes of Jerusalem, etc. </em>He does not here name them as though they were different persons, but he speaks by way of amplifying. He then says that he would punish these chief men, lest they should think themselves to be exempted, because they were superior to others in rank and honor; for we know that those who are elevated in the world are so filled with pride, that they deem themselves as free from all laws. This, then, is the reason why God expressly names the <em>princes </em>and the <em>eunuchs. </em>But he does not mean by the eunuchs those who had been emasculated, as we have stated already in several <em>places. </em>The chief men were called by this name, <span class="lang he-il">סרסים</span><em>serasim. </em><span class="cite-ref">(98)</span></p><p>He mentions the <em>princes of Jerusalem, </em>because they were especially proud, on account of their privileges as citizens; for in Jerusalem was the royal residence and the sanctuary of God. But the Prophet declares that their lot would be nothing better than that of the common people, because God would not suffer his holy name to be a mockery and all equity to be violated, and especially the covenant made in his name to be deemed as nothing, and rendered wholly void. At length he names <em>the whole people; </em>whosoever, he says, have passed between the parts of the calf, shall be punished. It follows — </p><p><strong>(98)</strong> It is rendered “<span class="lang el-gr">δυνάστας</span>, rulers,” by the <em>Sept., </em>“eunuchs,” by the <em>Vulg. </em>and <em>Syr., </em>and “princes” by the <em>Targ</em>. They were the attendants on royalty, not necessarily eunuchs, for Potiphar, who had a wife, was so called. (<span class="bvs">Gen_39:7</span>.) They may have acted as judges; and hence perhaps it is, that they are named here with “the priests.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
