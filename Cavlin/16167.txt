<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Blessing I will bless, etc</em>. God’s dwelling in the midst of the people was what constituted the great source of their blessedness; and now some of the proofs are mentioned which he would give of his fatherly regard, such as preparing and administering their ordinary food, relieving their wants, clothing their priests with salvation, and filling all his people with joy and gladness. This it was necessary should be added, for unless we have ocular demonstration of the divine goodness, we are not spiritual enough to rise upwards to the apprehension of it. We have a twofold demonstration of it in the matter of our daily food; first in the earth’s being enriched so as to furnish us with corn, and wine, and oil; and again in the earth’s produce being multiplied, through a secret power, so as to provide us with sufficient nourishment. There is here a promise that God would exert a special care over his own people to supply them with food, and that though they might not have a great abundance, yet the poor would be satisfied. We must not omit mentioning the remarkable and ludicrous mistake which the Papists have made upon this passage, and which shows the judicial stupidity they lie under to be such, that there is nothing so absurd they will not swallow. By confounding two letters into one, for <em>victus </em>they read <em>vidus, </em>and then conjectured that this must be a mutilation for <em>viduas ­ blessing I will bless her widows! </em>Thus they made “<em>widows </em>” out of “food”<em>­ </em>an extraordinary blunder, which we would scarcely credit, were it not a fact that they sing the word out in their temples to this present day. <span class="cite-ref">(139)</span> But God, who blesses the food of his own people, has infatuated their minds, and left them to confound everything in their absurd reveries and triflings. The inspired penman goes on to repeat what he had already said of other blessings, only the term<em>salvation </em>is used instead of <em>righteousness, </em>but in the same sense I already mentioned. Some understand it to have reference to purity of doctrine and holiness of life; but this seems a forced interpretation, and he means simply that they would be safe and happy under the divine protection. </p><p><strong>(139)</strong> “<span class="lang he-il">צידה</span>, <em>her provision. </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">ציד</span> signifies food which is taken in hunting, and then it is used to express food of any kind — provision generally. The Septuagint has <span class="lang el-gr">θήραν</span>, which denotes provision that has been hunted, and so obtained; but another reading of the Greek version <span class="lang el-gr">τὴν χήραν αὐτὢς</span>, which has been followed by the Vulgate, Arabic, and Ethiopic; the rendering of the Vulgate being <em>viduam ejus </em> This corrupt reading is noticed by Jerome.” ­ <em>Phillips. </em></p></div>
