<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>If a woman also vow. </em>He now proceeds to the point of which he proposed to treat, <em>i.e., </em>that vows made by persons who are not their own masters do not hold good; and he mentions two cases. For, in the <em>first </em>place, he teaches that if a daughter, whilst living with her father, has vowed anything without his knowledge, it is of no force. He lays down the same rule, if the father, hearing the vow, has disallowed it; but if he has held his peace, it is declared that his silence is equivalent to consent. Hence we gather that all those who are possessed of power do not do their duty unless they frankly and discreetly express their opposition whenever anything displeases them; since their connivance is a kind of tacit approbation. In the <em>second </em>place, he treats of married women, whose vows, made in the absence or with the disapproval of their husbands, he commands to be of none effect; but if the husbands have known of them, and been silent, he obliges their performance. For many deceptions might have thus arisen; since it is usual with many when they wish to gratify their wives, to conceal their opinion for the time, but, when the period of actual performance arrives, to elude what may have been promised. But unless they use their privilege in proper time, God would have them bear the punishment of their servile indulgence and dissimulation; but because women are often urged to deceive by their levity and inconstancy, this danger is also anticipated. It may also happen <span class="cite-ref">(326)</span> that a woman, when subject to her husband, may make a vow in the precipitate fervor of her zeal, and when he is dead, may retract it under the specious pretext that she was not then free and her own mistress; the same thing may occur when a divorced woman shall bind herself, and then when she has married, shall appear to herself to be released. Since instances of this wicked change of mind are too frequent, no wonder that this special precaution should be added, to prevent frauds. Wherefore God declares that the period when the vow was made is to be considered, so that they are no less liable than as if their condition had remained the same. He therefore condemns to the performance of their vow those women who have been emancipated from their fathers’ authority by marriage, and also who have been set free by death or divorce; yet it appears from the last verse of the chapter, that two exceptions, modifying the general law, are here peculiarly treated of. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(326)</span> The <em>Lat. </em>is, “Accidet ut mulier <em>in vidaitate viro non subjecta, </em>praecipiti zeli fervore voveat, <em>eo mortuo </em>retractet specioso praetextu, quia tunc libera non erat, nec sui juris.” The <em>Fr., “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Il adviendra qu’une femme estante en sujection de mari, vouera par une ardeur hastive de zele, le marl trespasse, elle prendra honneste couverture de se retracter, d’autant qu’elle n’estoit pas libre pour lors</span>.” I have translated the latter, not being able to understand the original, nor to reconcile them. </p></div></div>
