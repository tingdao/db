<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>An evil deed of Belial cleaved fast to him. </em>From this verse it appears that they had thus conspired together for his destruction, on the ground that they regarded him as a wicked man, and a person worthy of a thousand deaths. The insolence and arrogance which they manifested towards him proceeded from the false and wicked judgment which they had formed concerning him, and of which he made mention in the beginning of the psalm. They say, therefore, that <em>an evil deed of Belial holds </em>him shut up, and, as it were, bound fast. This the verb <span class="lang he-il">יצוק</span>, <em>yatsuk, </em>properly signifies; but in translating the verse I have followed the rendering which is most commonly received, reading <em>cleaveth fast to him, etc. </em>This expression is by others rendered <em>spreadeth upon him, </em>but this interpretation seems to me to be too constrained. As to the word <em>Belial, </em>we have already spoken of it in the eighteenth psalm. But as grammarians maintain that it is compounded of <span class="lang he-il">בלי</span>, <em>beli, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">יעל</span>, <em>yaäl, </em>which signify <em>not to rise, </em>the expression, <em>thing of Belial, </em>(for so it is literally in the Hebrew,) I understand in this place as meaning an extraordinary and hateful crime, which, as we commonly say, can never be expiated, and from which there is no possibility of escape; unless, perhaps, some would rather refer it to the affliction itself under which he labored, as if his enemies had said that he was seized by some incurable malady. <span class="cite-ref">(105)</span> But whatever may be as to this, his enemies regarded it as absolutely certain that God was altogether hostile to him, and would never be reconciled towards him, since he was chastising him with so much severity. When they add in the following clause, <em>he shall never be able to rise again, </em><span class="cite-ref">(106)</span> this clearly shows that they utterly cut off from him all hope of recovery. And certainly it was a sore temptation to David, who had in himself the testimony of a good conscience, to think that he was regarded by men as one who was pursued by the vengeance of God, nay, that they even cast him headlong into hell. But it pleased God thus to try his servant, that, trusting to the testimony of his own conscience, he should pay no regard to what men might say, or be troubled by the reproaches they might cast upon him. It was also his design to teach us, by his example, that we must seek the reward of our righteousness elsewhere than in this world, since we see with what unequal balances the world often sets itself to estimate the difference between virtue and vice. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(105)</span> There seems some difficulty as to what is meant by the words <span class="lang he-il">לעיעל</span>,<em>debar beliyaäl </em>They are literally <em>a word of Belial </em>But <em>word </em>in Hebrew is often used for <em>a thing </em>or <em>matter</em>, <span class="bvs">Exo_18:16</span>; <span class="bvs">Deu_17:4</span>; <span class="bvs">1Kg_14:13</span>. And <em>Belial </em>is used by the Hebrews to designate any detestable wickedness. Thus the original words bring out the meaning which Calvin fixes upon them; and in the same sense they are understood by several critics. Dr Geddes reads “a lawless deed;” and he explains the expression as referring to “David’s sin in the case of Uriah; which his enemies now assign as the cause of his present calamity; as if they had said, ‘This sin hath at length overtaken him,’ etc.” Horsley reads, “Some cursed thing presseth heavily upon him;” and by “some cursed thing” he understands “the crime which they supposed to be the cause of the divine judgment upon him.” Fry reads, “Some hellish crime cleaveth unto him.” Cresswell adopts the interpretation of M. Flaminius: “They say, Some load of iniquity presses upon him, (or clings to him,) so that from the place where he lieth he will rise no more.” But there is another sense which the words will bear. The Septuagint reads, “<span class="lang el-gr">λόγος παράνομος</span>;” the Vulgate, “a wicked word;” the Chaldee, “a perverse word;” the Syriac, “a word of iniquity;” and the Arabic, “words contrary to law;” and so the expression may mean a grievous slander or calumny. This is the sense in which it is understood by Hammond. “And this,” says he, “is said <em>to cleave </em>to him on whom it is fastened; it being the nature of calumnies, when strongly affixed on any, to cleave fast, and leave some evil mark behind them: “<em>Calumniare fortiter</em>, <em>aliquid hoerebit </em>.” In our vulgar version it is “an evil disease.” And <span class="lang he-il">דבר</span>, <em>debar</em>, no doubt sometimes signifies a <em>plague </em>or <em>pestilence </em>According to this rendering, the sense will be, he is smitten with an evil disease on account of his crimes, from which he will never recover. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(106)</span> So Hammond reads with our English version, <em>Now that he lieth he shall rise again no more</em>, and thinks that this is a proverbial phrase which was in use among the Hebrews, and which was applied to any sort of ruin, as well as to that which is effected by bodily disease. “The calumniator,” he observes, “may destroy and ruin as well as the pestilence; and from him was David’s danger most frequently, and not from a pestilential disease.” </p></div></div>
