<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_4:18</span><strong>.</strong><em>And Jesus walking. </em>As this history is placed by Luke after the two miracles, which we shall afterwards see, an opinion has commonly prevailed, that the miracle, which is here related by him, was performed some time after that they had been called by Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(336)</span> But the reason, which they allege, carries little weight: for no fixed and distinct order of dates was observed by the Evangelists in composing their narratives. The consequence is, that they disregard the order of time, and satisfy themselves with presenting, in a summary manner, the leading transactions in the life of Christ. They attended, no doubt, to the years, so as to make it plain to their readers, in what manner Christ was employed, during the course of three years, from the commencement of his preaching till his death. But miracles, which took place nearly about the same time, are freely intermixed: which will afterwards appear more clearly from many examples. <span class="cite-ref">(337)</span></p><p>That it is the same history, which is given by the three Evangelists, is proved by many arguments: but we may mention one, which will be sufficient to satisfy any reader, who is not contentious. All the three agree in stating, that Peter and Andrew, James and John, were made apostles. If they had been previously called, it would follow that they were apostates, who had forsaken their Master, despised their calling, and returned to their former occupation. There is only this difference between Luke and the other two, that he alone relates the miracle, which the others omit. But it is not uncommon with the Evangelists, to touch slightly one part of a transaction, and to leave out many of the circumstances. There is, therefore, no absurdity in saying, that a miracle, which is related by one, has been passed over by the other two. And we must bear in mind what John says, that, out of the innumerable miracles “which Jesus did<em>,” </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_21:25</span>,) a part only has been selected, which was sufficient to prove his divine power, and to confirm our faith in him. There is therefore no reason to wonder, if the calling of the four apostles is slightly touched by Matthew and Mark, while the occasion of it is more fully explained by Luke. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(336)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quelque temps apresque Jesus Christ ent appelle a soy Pierre, Andre, Jean, et Jaques</span>.” — “Some time after that Jesus Christ had called to himself Peter, Andrew, John, and James.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(337)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils ne s'amusent pas, esplucher de pres lequel est le premier, ou le </span><em class="lang fr-fr">second </em><em>.” </em>—<em>“They </em>do not give themselves the trouble of investigating closely which is first or second.” </p></div></div>
