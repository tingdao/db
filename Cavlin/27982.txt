<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong>I take what follows,<em>having the form of knowledge</em>, as a reason for the preceding; and it may be thus explained, — “because thou hast the form of knowledge.” For they professed to be the teachers of others, because they seemed to carry in their breasts all the secrets of the law. The word <em>form </em>is put for model (<em>exemplar </em> — pattern); <span class="cite-ref">(81)</span> for Paul has adopted <span class="lang el-gr">μόρφωσιν</span> and not <span class="lang el-gr">τύπον</span> : but he intended, I think, to point out the conspicuous pomp of their teaching, and what is commonly called display; and it certainly appears that they were destitute of that knowledge which they pretended. But Paul, by indirectly ridiculing the perverted use of the law, intimates, on the other hand, that right knowledge must be sought from the law, in order that the truth may have a solid basis. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(81)</span> The same word occurs only in <span class="bvs">2Ti_3:5</span><span class="lang el-gr">, “μόρφωσιν εὐσεβείας </span> — the form of godliness.” It is taken here in a good sense, as meaning a sketch, a delineation, an outline, a representation, or a summary. [<span class="bvs">Chalmers </span>] renders the words thus, — “The whole summary of knowledge and truth which is in the law.” Some understand by <em>knowledge </em>what refers to morals or outward conduct, and by <em>truth </em>what is to be believed. Others regard them as an instance of Hebrewism, two substantives being put, instead of a substantive and an adjective; the phrase would then be, “true knowledge.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
