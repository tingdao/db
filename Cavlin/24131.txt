<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_27:1</span><strong>.</strong><em>But when it was morning. </em>The high priest, with his council, after having examined him at an unseasonable hour of the night, finally resolve, at sunrise, to place him at the bar of the governor. By so doing, they observe the form of judicial proceedings, that they may not be suspected of undue haste, when they run to Pilate at an unusually early hour, as usually happens in cases of tumult. But it is probable, that when Christ had been led away from their council, they immediately held a consultation, and, without long delay, resolved what they would do; for we have been already told at what time Christ went out from them and met Peter, which was after the <em>cock-crowing, </em>and just as day was breaking. The Evangelists, therefore, do not mean that they removed from the place, <span class="cite-ref">(239)</span> but only relate, that as soon as it was daylight, they condemned Christ to death, and did not lose a moment in earnestly putting into execution their wicked design. What Luke formerly stated, (<span class="bvs">Luk_22:26</span>,) that <em>they assembled in the morning, </em>ought not to be explained as referring to the very beginning, but to the last act, which is immediately added: as if he had said, that as soon as it was day, our Lord having acknowledged that he was the Son of God, they pronounced their sentence of his death. Now if they had been permitted to decide in taking away life, they would all have been eager, in their fury, to murder him with their own hands; but as Pilate had cognizance of capital crimes, they are constrained to refer the matter to his jurisdiction; only they entangle him by their own previous decision. <span class="cite-ref">(240)</span> For the stoning of Stephen (<span class="bvs">Act_7:59</span>) took place in a seditious manner, as happens in cases of tumult; but it was proper that the Son of God should be solemnly condemned by an earthly judge, that he might efface our condemnation in heaven. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(239)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Du lieu ou ils avoyent esté assemblez la nuict</span>;” — “from the place where they had been assembled during the night.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(240)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est à dire, de l’avis qu’ils en avoyent desja donné en leur conseil</span>;” — “that is to say, by the opinion which they had already given respecting him in their council.” </p></div></div>
