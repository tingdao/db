<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>If thy right eye shall be a stumbling-block to thee. </em>It might be thought that, considering the weakness of the flesh and of nature, Christ pressed too severely on men, and therefore he anticipates all such complaints. The general meaning is, that however difficult, or severe, or troublesome, or harsh, any commandment of God may be, yet no excuse ought to be pleaded on those grounds, because the justice of God ought to stand higher in our estimation, than all that we reckon most precious and valuable. “You have no right to object to me, that you can scarcely turn your eyes in any direction, without being suddenly drawn away by some temptation: for you ought rather to part with your eyes, than to depart from the commandments of God.” And yet Christ does not mean, that we must mutilate our body, in order to obey God: but as all would readily wish, that they should not be restrained from the free use of their senses, Christ employs an exaggerated <span class="cite-ref">(407)</span> form of speech to show, that whatever hinders us from yielding that obedience to God which he requires in his law, ought to be cut off. And he does so expressly, because men allow themselves too much liberty in that respect. If the mind were pure, the eyes and hands would be obedient to it; for it is certain, that they have no movement of their own. But here we are deeply to blame. We are so far from being as careful as we ought to be, to avoid allurements, that we rather provoke our senses to wickedness by allowing them unbounded liberty. </p><p><strong>(407)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par une facon de parler </span><em class="lang fr-fr">hyperbolique, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">(c’est a dire, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">excessive </em><em>:”) </em>— “by a <em>hyperbolical</em>, that is, an <em>excessive </em>mode of speaking.” </p></div>
