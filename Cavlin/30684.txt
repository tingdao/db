<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Woe unto them. </em>It is a wonder that he inveighs against them so severely, when he had just said that it was not permitted to an angel to bring a railing accusation against Satan. But it was not his purpose to lay down a general rule. He only shewed briefly, by the example of Michael, how intolerable was their madness when they insolently reproached what God honored. It was certainly lawful for Michael to fulminate against Satan his final curse; and we see how vehemently the prophets threatened the ungodly; but when Michael forbore extreme severity (otherwise lawful), what madness was it to observe no moderation towards those excelling in glory? But when he pronounced woe on them, he did not so much imprecate evil on them, but rather reminded them what sort of end awaited them; and he did so, lest they should carry others with them to perdition. </p><p>He says that they were the <em>imitators of Cain</em>, who being ungrateful to God and perverting his worship through an ungodly and wicked heart, forfeited his birthright. He says that they were <em>deceived like Balaam </em>by a reward, because they adulterated the doctrine of true religion for the sake of filthy lucre. But the metaphor he uses, expresses something more; for he says that they <em>overflowed</em>, even because their excess was like overflowing water. He says in the third place, that they <em>imitated the contradiction of Core</em>, because they disturbed the order and quietness of the church. </p></div>
