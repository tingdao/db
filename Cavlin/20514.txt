<div class="comment-content"><p>Now it is added, <em>that he may go and proceed to the captivity, to the children of his own people </em>We see, then, that God does not regard the Prophet so much as the Israelites, because they had never willingly yielded to the Prophet when he brought a message by no means pleasing. For nothing could be more sad and hateful to them than to hear threats and curses. Because, then, they had never willingly bent to obedience, he is sent with a testimony that he had learnt what he uttered in Godâ€™s school; then that he had so learnt from God, that he adds nothing of his own; lastly, that he so speaks, that; the obstinacy of the people is not <em>overcome: Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, do thou nevertheless go forward </em>Wherefore? <em>Thou shalt say, thus saith the Lord. </em>We have already explained the meaning of this phrase, namely, where we are persuaded that our labor is pleasing to God, although it be useless to men, yet this ought to suffice us, that God has sent us. Then he wishes to try our constancy, lest when we see ourselves laboring in vain, we should cease on that account, instead of being prepared to obey, whatever may happen. </p></div>
