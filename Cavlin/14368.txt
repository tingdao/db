<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Rejoice in Jehovah, ye righteous. </em>Here the inspired writer addresses believers or the righteous by name, because they alone are capable of proclaiming the glory of God. Unbelievers, who have never tasted his goodness, cannot praise him from the heart, and God has no pleasure in his name being pronounced by their unholy tongues. But the context shows more distinctly why this exhortation is suitable for believers only. Many, accordingly, expound the latter clause, <em>Praise is comely for the upright, </em>as meaning, that if the ungodly or hypocrites attempt this exercise, it will turn to the reproach and dishonor of God rather than to his praise; nay, more, that they only profane his holy name. It is, no doubt, very true, as I have already remarked, that God creates for himself a church in the world by gracious adoption, for the express purpose, that his name may be duly praised by witnesses suitable for such a work. But the real meaning of the clause, <em>Praise is comely for the upright, </em>is, that there is no exercise in which they can be better employed. And, assuredly, since God by his daily benefits furnishes them with such matter for celebrating his glory, and since his boundless goodness, as we have elsewhere seen, is laid up as a peculiar treasure for them, it were disgraceful and utterly unreasonable for them to be silent in the praises of God. The amount of the matter is, that the principal exercise in which it becomes the righteous to be employed is to publish among men the righteousness, goodness, and power of God, the knowledge of which is implanted in their minds. Following other interpreters, I have translated the clause, <em>Praise is comely, </em>but the word rendered <em>comely </em>may also be properly rendered <em>desirable, </em>if we view it as derived from the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">אוה</span>, <em>avah, </em>which signifies to <em>wish </em>or <em>desire. </em>And certainly, when God allures believers so sweetly, it is proper that they employ themselves in celebrating his praises with their whole hearts. It is also to be observed, that when the prophet, after having in the first clause used the appellation, <em>the righteous, </em>immediately adds the words, <em>the upright, </em>which comprehend the inward integrity of the heart, he defines what true righteousness is, or in what it consists. </p></div>
