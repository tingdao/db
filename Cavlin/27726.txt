<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Away with such a fellow. </em>Luke showeth here how outrageously Paul’s sermon was interrupted. For they do not only oppress him with their crying, but they desire to have him put to death; where it doth also plainly appear how frenzy [frenzied] pride is. The Jews conceived so great good liking of themselves, that they did not only despise all the whole world in comparison of themselves, but they stood also more stoutly in defense of their own dignity than of the law itself, as if all religion did consist in this, that Abraham’s stock might excel all other mortal men. So now they rage against and rail upon Paul, because he said that he was sent to be the apostle of the Gentiles; as if God were bound by his own liberality to suffer the contempt of his power<span class="cite-ref">(518)</span> in the wicked and unthankful, on whom he bestowed excellent graces above all other. And it is no marvel if there were such fierceness and fury at that day among the Jews, seeing that being by all means wasted,<span class="cite-ref">(519)</span> and accustomed to suffer extreme reproaches at this day, they cease not, notwithstanding, to swell with servile pride. But these be fruits of reprobation, until God gather together the remnant according to Paul’s prophecy ( <span class="bvs">Rom_11:5</span>). </p><p><strong>(518)</strong></p><p>“ Numinis sui,” of his Deity. </p><p><strong>(519)</strong></p><p>“ Attriti,” trampled upon. </p></div>
