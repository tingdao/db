<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_18:21</span><strong>.</strong><em>Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me? </em>Peter made this objection according to the natural feelings and disposition of the flesh. It is natural to all men to wish to be forgiven; and, therefore, if any man does not immediately obtain forgiveness, he complains that he is treated with sternness and cruelty. But those who demand to be treated gently are far from being equally gentle towards others; and therefore, when our Lord exhorted his disciples to meekness, this doubt occurred to Peter: “If we be so strongly disposed to grant forgiveness, what will be the consequence, but that our lenity shall be an inducement to <em>offend </em>?” <span class="cite-ref">(571)</span> He asks, therefore, if it be proper frequently to forgive offenders; for, since the number <em>seven </em>is taken for a large number, the force of the adverb, ( <span class="lang el-gr">ἑπτάκις</span>) <em>seven times</em>, is the same as if he had said, “How long, Lord, dost thou wish that offenders be received into favor? for it is unreasonable, and by no means advantageous, that they should, in every case, find us willing to be reconciled.” But Christ is so far from yielding to this objection, that he expressly declares that there ought to be no limit to forgiving; <span class="cite-ref">(572)</span> for he did not intend to lay down a fixed number, but rather to enjoin us never to become wearied. </p><p><em>Luke </em>differs somewhat from <em>Matthew</em>; for he states the command of Christ to be simply, that we should be prepared to <em>forgive seven times; </em>but the meaning is the same, that we ought to be ready and prepared to grant forgiveness not once or twice, but as often as the sinner <em>shall repent </em>There is only this difference between them, that, according to Matthew, our Lord, in reproving Peter for taking too limited a view, employs hyperbolically a larger number, which of itself is sufficient to point out the substance of what is intended. For when Peter asked if he should <em>forgive seven times, </em>it was not because he did not choose to go any farther, but, by presenting the appearance of a great absurdity, to withdraw Christ from his opinion, as I have lately hinted. So then he who shall be prepared to <em>forgive seven times </em>will be willing to be reconciled as far as to the <em>seventieth </em>offense. </p><p>But the words of Luke give rise to another question; for Christ does not order us to grant <em>forgiveness</em>, till<em>the offender turn </em>to us and give evidence of <em>repentance</em>. <span class="cite-ref">(573)</span> I reply, there are two ways in which offenses are <em>forgiven. </em>If a man shall do me an injury, and I, laying aside the desire of revenge, do not cease to love him, but even repay kindness in place of injury, though I entertain an unfavorable opinion of him, as he deserves, still I am said to<em>forgive him</em>. For when God commands us to wish well to our enemies, He does not therefore demand that we approve in them what He condemns, but only desires that our minds shall be purified from all hatred. In this kind of pardon, so far are we from having any right to wait till he who has offended shall return of his own accord to be reconciled to us, that we ought to love those who deliberately provoke us, who spurn reconciliation, and add to the load of former offenses. A second kind of <em>forgiving </em>is, when we receive a <em>brother </em>into favor, so as to think favorably respecting him, and to be convinced that the remembrance of his offense is blotted out in the sight of God. And this is what I have formerly remarked, that in this passage Christ does not speak only of injuries which have been done to us, but of every kind of offenses; for he desires that, by our compassion, we shall raise up those who have fallen. <span class="cite-ref">(574)</span> This doctrine is very necessary, because naturally almost all of us are peevish beyond measure; and Satan, under the pretense of severity, drives us to cruel rigor, so that wretched men, to whom pardon is refused, are swallowed up by grief and despair. </p><p>But here another question arises. As soon as a man by words makes profession of <em>repentance</em>, are we bound to believe him? Were this done, we must of necessity go willingly and knowingly into mistake; for where will be discretion, if any man may freely impose on us, even to the hundredth offense? I answer, <em>first</em>, the discourse relates here to daily faults, in which every man, even the best, needs forgiveness. <span class="cite-ref">(575)</span> Since, then, amidst such infirmity of the flesh, our road is so slippery, and snares and attacks so numerous what will be the consequence if, at the second or third fall, the hope <em>of forgiveness </em>is cut off? We must add, <em>secondly, </em>that Christ does not deprive believers of the exercise of judgment, so as to yield a foolish readiness of belief to every slight expression, but only desires us to be so candid and merciful, as to stretch out the hand to <em>offenders</em>, provided there be evidence that they are sincerely dissatisfied with their sins. For repentance is a sacred thing, and therefore needs careful examination; but as soon as the offender gives probable evidence of conversion, Christ desires that he shall be admitted to reconciliation, lest, on being repulsed, he lose courage and fall back. </p><p><em>Thirdly</em>, It must be observed that, when any man, through his light and unsteady behavior, has exposed himself to suspicion, we may grant pardon when he asks it, and yet may do so in such a manner as to watch over his conduct for the future, that our forbearance and meekness, which proceed from the Spirit of Christ, may not become the subject of his ridicule. For we must observe the design of our Lord himself, that we ought, by our gentleness, to assist those who have fallen to rise again. And certainly we ought to imitate the goodness of our heavenly Father, who meets sinners at a distance to invite them to salvation. Besides, as repentance is a wonderful work of the Spirit, and is the creation of the new man, if we despise it, we offer an insult to God himself. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(571)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Incitera les autres a mal faire, et a nous offenser</span>;” — “shall induce others to do ill, and to offend us.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(572)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais tant s’en faut que Christ ait esgard a ceste objection pour lascher quelque chose de son dire, que mesmes il dit notamment et expressement que sans fin ne terme on doit tousiours pardonner</span>;” — “but so far was Christ from paying regard to that objection, to extenuate any thing that he had said, that he even says plainly and expressly, that without end or limit we must always forgive.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(573)</span> In the French copy he adds: — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car il semble par ce moyen qu’il commande aux siens de tenir leur coeur contre les pervers, et leur refuser pardon</span>;” — “for it appears in this way that he commands his followers to shut their heart against the obstinate, and to refuse them pardon.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(574)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceux qui sont cheus et ont failli</span>;” — “those who are fallen and have transgressed.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(575)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Esquelles les plus parfaits mesmes ont besoin d’estre supportez, et qu’on leur pardonner</span>;” — “which even the most perfect need to be borne with and forgiven.” </p></div></div>
