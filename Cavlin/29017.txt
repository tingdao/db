What a picture we have here of a complete minister, embracing in his anxieties and aims not one Church merely, or ten, or thirty, but all of them together, so that he instructs some, confirms others, exhorts others, gives counsel to some, and applies a remedy to the diseases of others! Now from Paul’s words we may infer, that no one can have a heartfelt concern for the Churches, without being harassed with many difficulties; for the government of the Church is no pleasant occupation, in which we may exercise ourselves agreeably and with delight of heart, <span class="cite-ref">(866)</span> but a hard and severe warfare, as has been previously mentioned, (<span class="bvs">2Co_10:4</span>,) — Satan from time to time giving us as much trouble as he can, and leaving no stone unturned to annoy us. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(865)</span> The word (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐπισύστασις)</span> is <em>translated </em>or rather <em>paraphrased </em>by Beza as follows: “Agmen illud in me consurgens;” — “That troop which rises up together against me.” He adds by way of explanation: “Certum est enim<span class="lang el-gr">ἐπισύστασιν </span>dici multitudinem quae adversus aliquem coierit, idque non semel, sed repetitis vicibus. Quia igitur multiplices erant curae, quarum tanquam agmine magis ac magis veluti obruebatur, Apostolus usus est translatitie hoc vocabulo, admodum significanter;” — “For it is certain that <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπισύστασιν </span> denotes a multitude that has come together against any one, and that not once merely, but in repeated instances. As, therefore, there were manifold cares, by which rushing upon him like a troop, more and more, he was in a manner overwhelmed, the Apostle, by way of metaphor, made use of this term very significantly.” <em>Raphelius </em>considers the term to be synonymous with an expression made use of by Cicero: “concursus occupationum;” — “a crowding together of engagements.” — (Cic. Fam. 7:33.) — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(866)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car le gouernement de l’Eglise n’est pas vne occupation ioyeuse pour nous exercer tout doucement, et par manicrc de passe-temps et exercice gracieux pour recreer nos esprits</span>;” — “For the government of the Church is not a pleasant occupation for exercising ourselves quite agreeably, and by way of pass-time, and an agreeable exercise for refreshing our minds.” </p></div></div>
