<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>That I may become a partaker of it. </em>As the Corinthians might think with themselves, that this was a peculiarity in Paulâ€™s case on the ground of his office, he argues, from the very design of it, that this is common to all Christians. For when he declares, that his aim had been, that he <em>might become a partaker of the gospel</em>, he indirectly intimates, that all who do not act the same part with him are unworthy of the fellowship of the gospel. To <em>become a partaker of the gospel </em>is to receive the fruit of it. </p></div>
