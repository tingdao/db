<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>These words spake Jesus. </em>After having preached to the disciples about bearing the cross, the Lord exhibited to them those consolations, by relying on which they would be enabled to persevere. Having promised the coming of the Spirit, he raised them to a better hope, and discoursed to them about the splendor and glory of his reign. Now he most properly betakes himself to prayer; for doctrine has no power, if efficacy be not imparted to it from above. He, therefore, holds out an example to teachers, not to employ themselves only in sowing the word, but, by mingling their prayers with it, to implore the assistance of God, that his blessing may render their labor fruitful. In short, this passage of the Lord Jesus <span class="cite-ref">(107)</span> Christ might be said to be the seal of the preceding doctrine, both that it might be ratified in itself, and that it might obtain full credit with the disciples. </p><p><em>And lifted up his eyes to heaven. </em>This circumstance related by John, that Christ prayed, <em>lifting up his eyes to heaven</em>, was an indication of uncommon ardor and vehemence; for by this attitude Christ testified that, in the affections of his mind, he was rather in heaven than in earth, so that, leaving men behind him, he converted familiarly with God. He looked towards <em>heaven</em>, not as if God’s presence were confined to <em>heaven</em>, for He <em>filleth also the earth</em>, (<span class="bvs">Jer_23:24</span>,) but because it is there chiefly that his majesty is displayed. Another reason was, that, by looking towards <em>heaven</em>, we are reminded that the majesty of God is far exalted above all creatures. It is with the same view that the hands are lifted up in prayer; for men, being by nature indolent and slow, and drawn downwards by their earthly disposition, need such excitements, or I should rather say, chariots, to raise them to <em>heaven </em></p><p>Yet if we desire actually to imitate Christ, we must take care that outward gestures do not express more than is in our mind, but that the inward feeling shall direct the eyes, the hands, the tongue, and every thing about us. We are told, indeed, that <em>the publican</em>, with downcast eyes, prayed aright to God, (<span class="bvs">Luk_18:13</span>,) but that is not inconsistent with what has now been stated; for, though he was confused and humbled on account of his sins, still this self-abasement did not prevent him from seeking pardon with full confidence. But it was proper that Christ should pray in a different manner, for he had nothing about him of which he ought to be ashamed; and it is certain that David himself prayed sometimes in one attitude, and sometimes in another, according to the circumstances in which he was placed. </p><p><em>Father, the hour is come. </em>Christ asks that his kingdom may be glorified, in order that he also may advance the glory of the Father. He says that <em>the hour is come, </em>because though, by miracles and by every kind of supernatural events, he had been manifested to be the Son of God, yet his spiritual kingdom was still in obscurity, but soon afterwards shone with full brightness. If it be objected, that never was there any thing less glorious than the death of Christ, which was then at hand, I reply, that in that death we behold a magnificent triumph which is concealed from wicked men; for there we perceive that, atonement having been made for sins, the world has been reconciled to God, the curse has been blotted out, and Satan has been vanquished. </p><p>It is also the object of Christ’s prayer, that his death may produce, through the power of the Heavenly Spirit, such fruit as had been decreed by the eternal purpose of God; for he says that<em>the hour is come</em>, not an hour which is determined by the fancy of men, but an hour which God had appointed. And yet the prayer is not superfluous, because, while Christ depends on the good pleasure of God, he knows that he ought to desire what God promised would certainly take place. True, God will do whatever he has decreed, not only though the whole world were asleep, but though it were opposed to him; but it is our duty to ask from him whatever he has promised, because the end and use <span class="cite-ref">(108)</span> of promises is to excite us to prayer. </p><p><em>That thy Son also may glorify thee. </em>He means that there is a mutual connection between the advancement of his glory and of the glory of his Father; for why is Christ manifested, but that he may lead us to the Father? Hence it follows, that all the honor which is bestowed on Christ is so far from diminishing the honor of the Father, that it confirms it the more. We ought always to remember under what character Christ speaks in this passage; for we must not look only at his eternal Divinity, because he speaks as God manifested in the flesh, and according to the office of Mediator. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(107)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Du Seigneur Jesus</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(108)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La fin et l’usage</span>.” </p></div></div>
