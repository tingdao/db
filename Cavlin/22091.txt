God wished some of his predictions to be partially understood, and the rest to remain concealed until the full period of the complete revelation should arrive.

This is the summary. He then says, <em>until the time of the end </em>Some one might possibly object; then for what purpose was this prediction delivered? For Daniel himself, who was instructed by the angel, could not thoroughly comprehend his own message, and the rest of the faithful, although versed in these prophetic studies, felt themselves in a labyrinth here. The answer is at hand, <em>until the time of the end; </em>and we must also remember that neither Daniel nor the rest of the faithful were deprived of all the advantage of this prophecy, for God explained to them whatever was sufficient for the necessities of their own times.
