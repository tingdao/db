<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>I speak what I have seen with my Father. </em>He had already made frequent mention of <em>his Father</em>; and now, by an argument drawn from contrary things, he infers that they are enemies to God, and are <em>the children of the devil</em>, because they oppose his doctrine. “For my part,” says he, “I bring nothing forward, but what I have learned from my Father. How comes it then that the word of God excites you to such fury, but because you have an opposite<em>father </em>?”He says that he <em>speaks</em>, and they <em>do</em>, because he discharged the office of a teacher, while they labored strenuously to extinguish his doctrine. At the same time, he protects the Gospel against contempt, by showing that it is not wonderful if it be opposed by <em>the children of the devil </em>Instead of <em>you do</em>, some render it, Do you <em>what you have seen with your father</em>; as if Christ had said, “Come, show that you are the children of the devil, by opposing me; for <em>I speak </em>nothing but what God has commanded.” </p></div>
