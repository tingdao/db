<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And Jacob dwelt</em>. Moses confirms what he had before declared, that, by the departure of Esau, the land was left to holy Jacob as its sole possessor. Although in appearance he did not obtain a single clod; yet, contented with the bare sight of the land, he exercised his faith; and Moses expressly compares him with his father, who had been a stranger in that land all his life. Therefore, though by the removal of his brother to another abode, Jacob was no little gainer; yet it was the Lordâ€™s will that this advantage should be hidden from his eyes, in order that he might depend entirely upon the promise. </p></div>
