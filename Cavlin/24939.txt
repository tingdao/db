<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>45.</strong><em>And blessed is she that believed </em>It was by a hidden movement of the Spirit, as is evident from a former statement of Luke, that Elisabeth spoke. The same Spirit declares that Mary is <em>blessed </em>because she <em>believed, </em>and by commending Mary’s faith, informs us generally in what the true happiness of men consists. Mary was <em>blessed, </em>because, embracing in her heart the promise of God, she conceived and brought forth a Savior to herself and to the whole which the Judges occupied; as when Cicero proposes to appeal from the Senate to the popular assembly, ”a subselliis in rem deferre.” Calvin may have had in his eye such a phrase as “imi subsellii vir,” and his meaning is fully brought out by his own version, “sur le marchepied.” — <em>Ed </em>world. This was peculiar to her: but as we have not a drop of righteousness, life, or any other benefit, except so far as the Lord presents them to us in his Word, it is faith alone that rescues us from the lowest poverty and misery, and makes us partakers of true happiness. </p><p>There is great weight in this clause, <em>for there shall be a fulfillment to those things which have been told her </em>The meaning is, faith gives way to the divine promises, that they may obtain their accomplishment in us. The truth of God certainly does not depend on the will of men, but God remains always true, (<span class="bvs">Rom_3:4</span>,) though the whole world—unbelievers and liars—should attempt to ruin his veracity. Yet, as unbelievers are unworthy to obtain the fruit of the promises, so Scripture teaches us, that by faith alone they are powerful for our salvation. God offers his benefits indiscriminately to all, and faith opens its bosom <span class="cite-ref">(44)</span> to receive them; while unbelief allows them to pass away, so as not to reach us. If there had been any unbelief in Mary, that could not prevent God from accomplishing his work in any other way which he might choose. But she is called <em>blessed, </em>because she received by faith the blessing offered to her, and opened up the way to God for its accomplishment; while faith, on the other hand, shuts the gate, and restrains his hand from working, that they who refuse the praise due to its power may not feel its saving effect. We must observe also the relation between the <em>word </em>and <em>faith, </em>from which we learn that, in the act of believing, we give our assent to God who speaks to us, and hold for certain what he has promised to us that he will do. The phrase, <em>by the Lord, </em>is of the same import with an expression in common use, <em>on the part of God; </em>for the promise had been brought by the angel, but proceeded from God alone. Hence we infer that, whether God employs the ministrations of angels or of men, he wishes equal honor to be paid to his Word as if he were visibly descending from heaven. </p><p><strong>(44)</strong> “Sinum expandit;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">mais la foy, par maniere dire, tend son giron pour les recevoir</span><em>;” </em>—<em>“ </em>but faith, so to speak, holds its lap to receive them.” </p></div>
