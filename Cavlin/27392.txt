<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>God hath raised him up. </em>The death of Christ was the salvation of the godly, yet joined with the resurrection; therefore doth Paul stand longer upon this second point. For he should never have persuaded his hearers that they were to seek salvation in Christâ€™s death, unless the power of Almighty God had appeared in raising Christ from death. </p></div>
