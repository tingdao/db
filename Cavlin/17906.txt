<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Sing unto the Lord </em>He continues his exhortation, showing what is the feeling from which this thanksgiving ought to proceed; for he shows that it is our duty to proclaim the goodness of God to every nation. While we exhort and encourage others, we must not at the same time sit down in indolence, but it is proper that we set an example before others; for nothing can be more absurd than to see lazy and slothful men who are exciting other men to praise God. </p><p><em>For he hath done glorious things. </em>When he asserts that God <em>hath done gloriously</em>, he means that there is abundant ground for singing. The Lord does not wish that his praises should be proclaimed without any reason, but holds out a very rich and very abundant subject of praise, when he frees his people from very hard bondage. We have said that this song is not limited to a short period, but, on the contrary, extends to the whole of Christâ€™s reign. This work therefore is truly glorious, that <em>God sent his Son </em>to reconcile us to himself, (<span class="bvs">Joh_3:16</span>,) and to destroy the dominion of death and the devil. (<span class="bvs">Heb_2:14</span>.) If, therefore, we consider the work of our deliverance as we ought to do, we shall have very abundant ground for praising God. </p><p><em>And this hath been made known through all the earth. </em>When he says that this <em>hath been made known</em>, he glances at the calling of the Gentiles, and confirms what has been already stated, that the work is such as ought not to be concealed in a corner, but to be everywhere proclaimed. </p></div>
