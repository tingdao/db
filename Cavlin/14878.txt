<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>All the earth shall worship thee. </em>The Psalmist had good reason for insisting upon this one point again and again. Though all tongues were tuned to the praise of God, they never could adequately extol it; and yet such are the negligence and the perversity of men, that they will scarcely lift one feeble note in celebration of a theme which should command their united strength and might. We have another prediction here, of a time being to come when God would be worshipped, not only by the Jews, a small section of the human family, but by all the nations which would be eventually brought under his government. And we are not to consider that he refers to such a worship as would be constrained, and only not withheld, because resistance might be dangerous, but to the sincere homage of the heart — <em>they shall sing unto thee! they shall sing unto thy name </em>Praise is the best of all sacrifices, (as we are told, <span class="bvs">Psa_50:14</span>) and the true evidence of godliness. <span class="cite-ref">(470)</span></p><p><strong>(470)</strong> “Est enim hoc praecipuum laudis sacrificium, ut habetur, Psalmo 50:14, 23, ac verum etiam testimonium pietatis. — <em>Lat</em>. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car c’est le principal sacrifice, que le sacrifice de louange, etc., et aussi le vray tesmoignage de piete</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
