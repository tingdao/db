<div class="comment-content"><p>He afterwards adds, <em>I will besprinkle thee with filth, </em>or defilements. The Prophet still alludes to the similitude of a harlot, who is well and sumptuously adorned, and by her charms captivates the eyes of all: but when any one takes mire and filth from the middle of the road, and bespatters her with it, there is then no one who will not turn away his eyes from so filthy an object. But we have already explained the import of this. God is indeed said to besprinkle kingdoms with defilements, when he casts them down; for they all begin freely to express their opinion: and those who before pretended great admiration, now rise up and bring forth many reproachful things. Then it is, that the Lord is said to besprinkle great kingdoms with filth and defilements. </p><p>He then adds, <em>I will disgrace thee </em><span class="lang he-il">נבל</span>, <em>nubel, </em>is to fall, and it is applied to dead bodies; but it means also to disgrace, as it is to be taken here.<em>I will make thee as the dung </em>Some think <span class="lang he-il">רואי</span>, <em>ruai, </em>to be dung, or something fetid: but as it comes from <span class="lang he-il">ראה</span>, <em>rae</em>, to see, and is in many parts of Scripture taken for vision or view, they are more correct, in my judgment, who render it thus, <em>I will make thee an example; </em>so Jerome renders it; as though he said, “Thou shalt be a spectacle to all nations.” <span class="cite-ref">(241)</span> And Nineveh is said to be made an example, because its ruin was more memorable than that of any other which had previously happened. Thou shalt then <em>be a spectacle; </em>that is, the calamity which I now denounce shall attract the observation of all. It afterwards follows — </p><p><strong>(241)</strong> The <em>Septuagint </em>favors this meaning, “<span class="lang el-gr">εις παραδειγμα</span> —for an example.” In this sense <em>Grotius </em>and <em>Piscator </em>take the word. <em>Henderson, </em>with less propriety, renders it “gazingstock,” the word of our version. <em>Newcome </em>translates it “dung,” according to the Rabbins. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
