<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>In tumults </em>In proportion to the calmness and gentleness of Paul’s disposition was there the greater excellence displayed in his standing undaunted in the face of <em>tumults; </em>and he takes praise to himself on this account — that while he regarded tumults with abhorrence, he nevertheless encountered them with bravery. <span class="cite-ref">(587)</span> Nor does the praise simply consist in his being unmoved by <em>tumults, </em>(this being commonly found among all riotous persons, <span class="cite-ref">(588)</span>) but in his being thrown into no alarm by tumults that had been stirred up through the fault of others. And, unquestionably, two things are required on the part of ministers of the Gospel — that they should endeavor to the utmost of their power to maintain peace, and yet on the other hand go forward, undaunted, through the midst of commotions, so as not to turn aside from the right course, though heaven and earth should be mingled. <span class="cite-ref">(589)</span> Chrysostom, however, prefers to understand <span class="lang el-gr">ἀκαταστασίαις</span> to mean — frequent expulsions, <span class="cite-ref">(590)</span> inasmuch as there afforded him a place of rest. <span class="cite-ref">(591)</span><em>In fastings </em>He does not mean — hunger arising from destitution, but a voluntary exercise of abstinence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(587)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’vne courage magnanime</span>;” — “With magnanimous heroism.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(588)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Veu que cela est coustumier... tous mutins de ne s’estonner point quand seditions s’esmeuuent</span>;” — “As it is customary for all riotous persons to be thrown into no alarm when tumults break out.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(589)</span> A proverbial expression made use of by Virgil. ‘n.

Iud’i autem faciunt jam infensi et infesti hostes Pauli, ut vel ex actibus Luc’ satis patet; Paulus<span class="lang el-gr">ἀκατάστατος</span>, (Jacobi 1:8) dici potest, licet sine animi sui vitio;” — (“As not being allowed to remain long at rest, as it were, in one place, but always changing his place and soil (for the sake of avoiding dangers.) The Jews were enemies to Paul, so exasperated and deadly, as appears even from Luke’s narrative in the Acts, that Paul may be said to have been <em>unstable</em>, (<span class="bvs">Jas_1:8</span>,) though without any fault on his part.” — “I agree,” says Dr. <em>Bloomfield</em>, “with Theophyl., Schleus., and Leun., that the term refers to that <em>unsettled and wandering kind of life</em>, which, that the Apostle thought very miserable, is plain from his connecting it at <span class="bvs">1Co_4:11</span>, with the endurance of hunger, thirst, and nakedness,(<span class="lang el-gr">Πεινῶμεν καὶ διψῶμεν, καὶ γυμνητεύομεν, καὶ ἀστατοῦμεν</span>) which passage, indeed, is the best comment on the present, and shows that <span class="lang el-gr">κόποις</span> (<em>labors</em>) must be chiefly understood of his labors at his trade, and <span class="lang el-gr">νηστείαις</span>, (<em>fastings</em>,) of that insufficient support, which labors so interrupted by his ministerial duties, could alone be expected to supply. <span class="lang el-gr">᾿Αγρυπνίαις</span> (<em>watchings</em>) seems to refer to the abridgment of his rest by night, to make up for the time expended by day on his ministerial labors.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
