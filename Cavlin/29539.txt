<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22</strong><em>Servants, be obedient. </em>Anything that is stated here respecting <em>servants </em>requires no exposition, as it has been already expounded in commenting on <span class="bvs">Eph_6:1</span>, with the exception of these two expressions, â€” <em>For we serve the Lord Christ</em>; and, <em>He that will act unjustly will receive the reward of his iniquity. </em></p><p>By the former statement he means, that service is done to men in such a way that Christ at the same time holds supremacy of dominion, and is the supreme master. Here, truly, is choice consolation for all that are under subjection, inasmuch as they are informed that, while they willingly serve their masters, their services are acceptable to Christ, as though they had been rendered to him. From this, also, Paul gathers, that they will <em>receive </em>from him <em>a reward</em>, but it is the <em>reward of inheritance</em>, by which he means that the very thing that is bestowed in reward of works is freely given to us by God, for <em>inheritance </em>comes from adoption. </p><p>In the second clause he again comforts <em>servants</em>, by saying that, if they are oppressed by the unjust cruelty of their masters, God himself will take vengeance, and will not, on the ground that they are <em>servants, </em>overlook the injuries inflicted upon them, inasmuch as there is <em>no respect of persons with him</em>. For this consideration might diminish their courage, if they imagined that God had no regard for them, or no great regard, and that their miseries gave him no concern. Besides, it often happens that servants themselves endeavor to avenge injurious and cruel treatment. He obviates, accordingly, this evil, by admonishing them to wait patiently the judgment of God. </p></div>
