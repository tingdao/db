<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>He shall have dominion from sea to sea. </em>As the Lord, when he promised his people the land of Canaan for an inheritance, assigned to it these four boundaries, (<span class="bvs">Gen_15:18</span>,) David intimates, that so long as the kingdom shall continue to exist, the possession of the promised land will be entire, to teach the faithful that the blessing of God cannot be fully realised, except whilst this kingdom shall flourish. He therefore declares that he will exercise dominion from the Red Sea, or from that arm of the Egyptian sea to the sea of Syria, which is called the Sea of the Philistines, <span class="cite-ref">(134)</span> and also from the river Euphrates to the great wilderness. If it is objected that such narrow bounds do not correspond with the kingdom of Christ, which was to be extended from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, we reply, that David obviously accommodates his language to his own time, the amplitude of the kingdom of Christ not having been, as yet, fully unfolded. He has therefore begun his description in phraseology well known, and in familiar use under the law and the prophets; and even Christ himself commenced his reign within the limits here marked out before he penetrated to the uttermost boundaries of the earth; as it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_110:2</span>, </p><p>“The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion.” </p><p>But, soon after, the Psalmist proceeds to speak of the enlarged extent of the empire of this king, declaring that the kings beyond the sea shall also be tributaries to him; and also that the inhabitants of the desert shall receive his yoke. The word <span class="lang he-il">ציים</span>, <em>tsiim, </em><span class="cite-ref">(135)</span> which we have translated <em>inhabitants of the desert, </em>is, I have no doubt, to be understood of those who, dwelling towards the south, were at a great distance from the land of Canaan. The Prophet immediately adds, that <em>the enemies of the king shall lick the dust </em>in token of their reverence. This, as is well known, was in ancient times a customary ceremony among the nations of the East; and Alexander the Great, after he had conquered the East, wished to compel his subjects to practice it, from which arose great dissatisfaction and contentions, the Macedonians disdainfully refusing to yield such a slavish and degrading mark of subjection. <span class="cite-ref">(136)</span> The meaning then is, that the king chosen by God in Judea will obtain so complete a victory over all his enemies, far and wide, that they shall come humbly to pay him homage. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(134)</span> Or the Mediterranean. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(135)</span><span class="lang he-il">ציים</span>,<em>tsiim</em>, is from <span class="lang he-il">ציה</span>, <em>tsiyah</em>, <em>a dry and parched country</em>, <em>a desert </em>Rosenmüller translates it, <em>the rude nations </em>“The word <span class="lang he-il">ציים</span>,” says he, “seems to signify rude, barbarous tribes; the inhabitants of desert places, — of vast and unknown regions. This sense appears to be most suitable, both here and in <span class="bvs">Psa_74:14</span>. Hence it is used <span class="bvs">Isa_13:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Jer_50:39</span>, for the animals, — the wild beasts that inhabit jungles and deserts.” The LXX. translate it <span class="lang el-gr">Αιθιοπες</span>, “the Æthiopians;” and in like manner the Vulgate, Æthiopic, and Arabic versions. Boothroyd is of opinion that the wild Arabs may be intended. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(136)</span> The kings of Persia never admitted any into their presence without exacting this act of adoration, and it was the Persian custom which Alexander wished to introduce among the Macedonians. — <em>Rollin </em>’<em>s Ancient History</em>, volume 4, p. 288. This custom is still extant among the Turks. As soon as an ambassador sees the Sultan, he falls on his knees and kisses the ground. </p></div></div>
