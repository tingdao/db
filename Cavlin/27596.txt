<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>No small miracles. </em>He calleth miracles <em>virtutes </em>or <em>powers, </em>after the common custom of the Scripture, which were testimonies of the extraordinary power of God. And showeth that Paul’s apostleship was set forth with these ensigns, that his doctrine might have the greater authority. For it is a common speech, That wonders and signs are showed by the hand of men. So that the praise thereof is ascribed to God alone as to the author; and man is only the minister. And that he may the more amplify the miracles, he saith that handkerchiefs and partlets<span class="cite-ref">(366)</span> were brought unto the sick, which so soon as they touched they were healed. It is not unknown<span class="cite-ref">(367)</span> to what end Paul had such power given him, to wit, that he might prove himself to be a true apostle of Christ, that he might make the gospel to be believed, and might confirm his ministry. And here it is expedient to call to mind those things which we had before, touching the lawful use of miracles. And whereas God did heal the sick with Paul’s handkerchiefs, it tended to that end, that even those who had never seen the man might, notwithstanding, reverently embrace his doctrine, though he himself were absent. For which cause the Papists are more blockish, who wrest this place unto their relics; as if Paul sent his handkerchiefs that men might worship them and kiss them<span class="cite-ref">(368)</span> in honor of them; as in Papistry, they worship Francis’ shoes and mantle, Rose’s girdle, Saint Margaret’s comb, and such like trifles. Yea, rather, he did choose most simple<span class="cite-ref">(369)</span> things, lest any superstition should arise by reason of the price or pomp. For he was fully determined to keep Christ’s glory sound and undiminished. </p><p><strong>(366)</strong></p><p>“ Semicinctia,” girdles. </p><p><strong>(367)</strong></p><p>“ Non obscurum est,” it is clear. </p><p><strong>(368)</strong></p><p>“ Oscularentur venerabundi homines,” men given to veneration might kiss them. </p><p><strong>(369)</strong></p><p>“ Vilissimas,” most worthless. </p></div>
