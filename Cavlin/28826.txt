<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>For if I make you sorry </em>Here we have the proof of the foregoing statement. No one willingly occasions sorrow to himself. Now Paul says, that he has such a fellow-feeling with the Corinthians, <span class="cite-ref">(313)</span> that he cannot feel joyful, unless he sees them happy. Nay more, he declares that they were the source and the authors of his joy — which they could not be, if they were themselves sorrowful. If this disposition prevail in pastors, it will be the best restraint, to keep them back from alarming with terrors those minds, which they ought rather to have encouraged by means of a cheerful affability. For from this arises an excessively morose harshness <span class="cite-ref">(314)</span> — so that we do not rejoice in the welfare of the Church, as were becoming. </p><p><strong>(313)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est à dire vne telle conuenance et conionction de nature et d’affections, entre luy et les Corinthiens</span>;” — “That is to say, such an agreement and connection of nature and affections between him and the Corinthians.” </p><p><strong>(314)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La seuerite trop grande et chagrin</span>;” — “An excessive severity and chagrin.” </p></div>
