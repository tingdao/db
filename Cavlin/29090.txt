<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And when they perceived the grace. </em>They who treated with contempt the grace of God, by which the most eminent apostles had been led to admire and reverence Paul, are charged with hateful and proud disdain. If they should allege that they were ignorant of that which the apostles knew from the beginning, the hypocritical pretense was not to be endured. This admonishes us to yield to the grace of God, wherever it is perceived, unless we choose to contend with the Holy Spirit, whose will it is that his gifts shall not remain unemployed. The grace which the apostles perceived to have been given to Paul and Barnabas, induced them to sanction their ministry by receiving them as their associates. </p><p><em>James and Cephas</em>. I have already stated, that James was the son of Alpheus. He could not be “the brother of John” who had been lately put to death by Herod, (<span class="bvs">Act_12:2</span>,) and to suppose that one of the disciples had been placed above the apostles would be absurd. That he held the highest rank among the apostles, is made evident by Luke, who ascribes to him the summing up and decision of the cause in the council, (<span class="bvs">Act_15:13</span>,) and afterwards mentions his having assembled “all the elders” of the church of Jerusalem. (<span class="bvs">Act_21:18</span>.) When he says, that they <em>seemed to be pillars</em>, he does not speak contemptuously, but quotes the general opinion, arguing from it, that what was done by such men ought not to be lightly set aside. In a question relating to diversity of rank, it is surprising that James should be mentioned before Peter; but the reason perhaps is, that he presided over the church at Jerusalem. As to the word <em>pillar</em>, we know that, from the nature of things, those who excel in ability, prudence, or other gifts, possess greater authority. And even in the Church of God, he who enjoys a larger measure of grace ought, on that account, to receive the higher honor. It argues ingratitude, nay impiety, not to worship the Spirit of God wherever he appears in his gifts; and as a people cannot want a pastor, so the assemblies of pastors require a moderator. But in all cases let the rule be followed, </p><p>“He that is greatest among you shall be your servant”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_23:11</span>.) </p></div>
