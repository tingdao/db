<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>44.</strong><em>He findeth it empty </em>Christ is unquestionably describing those who, being destitute of the Spirit of God, are prepared for receiving the devil; for believers, in whom the Spirit of God efficaciously dwells, are fortified on all sides, so that no opening is left for Satan. The metaphor of <em>a house swept and embellished </em>is taken from men who find pleasure in the cleanness and neatness of their apartments; for to Satan no sight is beautiful but deformity itself, and no smell is sweet but filth and nastiness. The meaning therefore is, that Satan never finds a more appropriate habitation within us, than when, having parted with Christ, we receive Satan as a guest. <span class="cite-ref">(147)</span> His highest delight is in that <em>emptiness </em>by which the neglect of divine grace is followed. <span class="cite-ref">(148)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(147)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que quand, laissans Christ, et nous esloignans de luy, nous attirons c’est hoste a nous</span>;” — “that when leaving Christ, and withdrawing from him, we entice this guest.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(148)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce qu’il aime donc le plus, et ou il prend un souverain plaisir, c’est ceste place vuide qui se fait quand l’homme ne tient conte de la grace de Dieu, et est nonchalant d’en bien user</span>;” — “that which he loves most, and in which he takes a supreme pleasure, is the emptiness which is produced, when man sets no value on the grace of God, and is indifferent about making a good use of it.” </p></div></div>
