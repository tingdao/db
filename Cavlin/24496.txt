<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_7:32</span><strong>.</strong><em>And they bring to him one who was deaf. </em>The reason why <em>they implored him to lay his hands upon him </em>may be learned from passages which we have already considered; for the <em>laying on of hands </em>was a solemn symbol of consecration, <span class="cite-ref">(423)</span> and by means of it, the gifts of the Holy Spirit were also bestowed. And there is no doubt that this ceremony was frequently used by Christ; so that those men requested nothing but what they knew that he had been formerly in the habit of doing. On the present occasion, Christ employs other symbols; for he puts his <em>spittle </em>on the <em>tongue </em>of the <em>dumb man, and puts his fingers into his ears. </em>The <em>laying on of hands </em>would of itself have been sufficiently efficacious, and even, without moving a finger, he might have accomplished it by a single act of his will; but it is evident that he made abundant use of outward signs, when they were found to be advantageous. Thus, by touching the <em>tongue </em>with <em>spittle</em>, he intended to point out that the faculty of speech was communicated by himself alone; and by <em>putting his finger into the ears</em>, he showed that it belonged to his office to pierce the ears of the deaf. There is no necessity for having recourse to allegories; and we find that those who have amused themselves with ingenious discussions on this subject, are so far from bringing forward any thing of real value, that they tend rather to hold up the Scriptures to ridicule. Readers of sobriety and judgment will be satisfied with this single instruction, that we obtain from Christ, in answer to our prayers, both speech and hearing; for he pours his energy into our tongues, and pierces our ears with his fingers. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(423)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour dedier et eonsacrer les personnes</span>;” — “for dedicating and con-secrating persons.” </p></div></div>
