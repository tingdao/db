<div class="comment-content"><p>This is a remarkable sealing of the whole of what we have hitherto found said respecting the destruction of Babylon; for the Prophet not only spoke and promulgated what the Spirit of God had dictated, but also put it down in a book; and not contented with this, he delivered the book to Seraiah the son of Neriah, when he went to Babylon by the command of Zedekiah the king, that he might read it there, east it into the Euphrates, and strengthen himself in the hope of all those things which had been divinely predicted. </p><p>He says first that he <em>commanded Seraiah </em>what he was to do, even to read the volume and to throw it into the Euphrates, as we shall hereafter see. But he points out the time and mentions the disposition of Seraiah, that we might not think it strange that the Prophet dared to give an authoritative command to the king’s messenger, which a man of another character would have refused. As to the time, it was the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah; seven years before the city was taken, being besieged the ninth year and taken the eleventh. Then seven years before the destruction and ruin of the city, Seraiah was sent by the king to Babylon. There is no doubt but that the message was sent to pacify the king of Babylon, who had been offended with the fickleness and perfidy of King Zedekiah; an ambassador was then sent to seek pardon. But what the Jews say, that Zedekiah went to Babylon, is wholly groundless; and we know that Sederola, whence they have taken this, is full of all kinds of fables and trifles; and on such a point as this, sacred history would not have been silent, for it was a thing of great moment; and then the particle <span class="lang he-il">את</span>, <em>at, </em>expresses no such thing, but may be rendered in this sense, that the messenger was <em>sent for, </em>or <em>by, </em>or <em>in the place of Zedekiah</em>. Let us then be satisfied with this simple and obvious explanation, that Seraiah was the king’s messenger sent to remove the offenses taken by the Babylonians. <span class="cite-ref">(110)</span> And this happened <em>in the fourth year of Zedekiah. </em></p><p>Now, by calling Seraiah <em>a prince of quietness, </em>I doubt not but that a reference is made to his gentleness and meekness; and I wonder that in so plain a thing interpreters have toiled so much. One renders it, even the Chaldean paraphrase, “the prince of the oblations,” as though he was set over to examine the presents offered to the king. Others imagine that he was a facetious man who amused the king in his fears; and others think that he was called “prince of quietness,” because he preserved the city in a quiet state. But all these things are groundless. <span class="cite-ref">(111)</span> No other view, then, seems to me right, but that he was a prince of a quiet disposition. Therefore the word “quietness” ought not to be referred to any office, but a noun in the genitive case used instead of an adjective. He was, then, a quiet prince, or one of a placid disposition. And this commendation was not without reason added, because we know how haughtily the princes rejected everything commanded them by the servants of God. Seraiah might have objected, and said that he was sent to Babylon, not by a private person, and one of the common people, but by the king himself. He might then have haughtily reproved the Prophet for taking too much liberty with him, “Who art thou, that thou darest to command me, when I sustain the person of the king? and when I am going in his name to the king of Babylon? and then thou seekest to create disturbances by ordering me to read this volume. What if it be found on me? what if some were to suspect that I carry such a thing to Babylon? would I not, in the first place, carry death in my bosom? and would I not, in the second place, be perfidious to my king? for thus my message would be extremely disliked.” </p><p>As then Seraiah might have stated all these things, and have rejected the command which Jeremiah gave him, his gentleness is expressly mentioned, even that he was a meek man, and who withheld not his service — who, in short, was ready to obey God and his servant. What, in a word, is here commended<em>, </em>is the meekness of Seraiah, that he received the Prophet with so much readiness, — that he suffered himself to be commanded by him, and that he also hesitated not to execute what he had commanded, when yet it might have been a capital offense, and it might especially have been adverse to his mission, which was to reconcile the king of Babylon. And surely it is an example worthy of being noticed, that Seraiah was not deterred by danger from rendering immediate obedience to the Prophet’s command, nor did he regard himself nor the omee committed to him, so as to reject the Prophet, according to the usual conduct of princes, under the pretext of their own dignity; but laying aside his own honor and forgetting all his greatness, he became a disciple to Jeremiah, who yet, as it is well known, had been long despised by the people, and had sometimes been nearly brought to death. It was, then, a remarkable instance of virtue in Seraiah, that he received with so much modesty and readiness what had been said to him by the Prophet, and that he obeyed his command, to the evident danger of his own life. It now follows, — </p><p><strong>(110)</strong> The <em>Vulg</em>. and <em>Syr</em>. have “with,” but the <em>Sept</em>. and <em>Targ</em>. give it the meaning of “from;” and <span class="lang he-il">את</span> has often the meaning of <span class="lang he-il">מאת</span>; see <span class="bvs">Gen_6:1</span>; <span class="bvs">Gen_44:4</span>; <span class="bvs">Gen_50:9</span>. So <em>Gataker, Venema</em>, and <em>Blayney</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><strong>(111)</strong> The variety in the early versions is remarkable; the <em>Sept</em>. and the <em>Targ</em>. have “the prince of gifts” or presents; the <em>Vulg</em>. , “the prince of prophecy;” and the <em>Syr</em>. , “the prince of warfare.” A similar phrase is found in <span class="bvs">1Ch_22:9</span>; Solomon is said to be “a man of rest,” <span class="lang he-il">איש</span><span class="lang he-il">מנוחה</span>. The meaning most suitable to this passage is that if <em>Calvin </em>and of our version. So though <em>Gataker</em>; but <em>Lowth </em>and <em>Parkhurst </em>regarded the words as pointing out his office as the king’s chief chamberlain, “the prince of the resting-place,” or chamber; but the objection to this is, that the word is never used in this sense; it means not the rest of sleep, but the rest of peace and quietness. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
