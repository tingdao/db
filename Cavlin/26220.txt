<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And it was the Sabbath. </em>Christ was well aware how great offense would immediately arise, when they saw a man walk along laden with burdens; for the Law expressly forbids </p><p>to carry any burden whatever on the Sabbath-day, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Jer_17:21</span>.) </p><p>But there were two reasons why Christ, disregarding this danger, chose to make such an exhibition; first, that the miracle might be more extensively known; and, secondly, that he might give occasion, and, as it were, open up the way for the beautiful discourse which he delivered immediately afterwards. Of so great importance was the knowledge of that miracle, that he found it to be his duty to despise boldly the offense taken by the people, particularly because he had at hand a just defense, by which, though he did not pacify the ungodly, he abundantly refuted their calumnies. We ought therefore to observe this rule, that though the whole world kindle into rage, we ought to proclaim the glory of God and celebrate His works, so far as His glory requires that they should be made known. Nor ought we to be uneasy or discouraged, though our labors should not be immediately successful, provided that we keep in view the object which I have stated, and do not go beyond the limits of our office. </p></div>
