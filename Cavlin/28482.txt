<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Know ye not that our bodies are the members</em>, etc. Here we have an explanation, or, if you prefer it, an amplification of the foregoing statement. For that expression, <em>the body is for the Lord</em>, might, owing to its brevity, be somewhat obscure. Hence he says, as if with the view of explaining it, that Christ is joined with us and we with him in such a way, that we become one body with him. Accordingly, if I have connection with an harlot, I tear Christ in pieces, so far as it is in my power to do so; for it is impossible for me to draw Him into fellowship with such pollution. <span class="cite-ref">(354)</span> Now as that must be held in abhorrence, <span class="cite-ref">(355)</span> he makes use of the expression which he is accustomed to employ in reference to things that are absurd — <em>God forbid </em><span class="cite-ref">(356)</span> Observe, that the spiritual connection which we have with Christ belongs not merely to the soul, but also to the body, so that we are <em>flesh of his flesh</em>, <em>etc </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_5:30</span>.) Otherwise the hope of a resurrection were weak, if our connection were not of that nature — full and complete. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(354)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vne pollution si fade et infame</span>;” — “A pollution so filthy and infamous.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(355)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour ce que ceci est vne chose abominable, et que nous deuons auoir en horreur</span>;” — “As that is an abominable thing, and we must hold it in abhorrence.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(356)</span> The original expression, <span class="lang el-gr">Μή γέοιτο</span> !<em>Away with it </em>! corresponds to the Hebrew term <span class="lang he-il">חללה</span>,<em>far be it </em>! Thus in <span class="bvs">Gen_18:25</span>, <span class="lang he-il">חללה לך משת כדברהזה</span>,<em>Far be it from thee to act in this manner </em>! Homer makes use of a similar expression — <span class="lang el-gr">μὴ τοῦτο θεος τελεσειεν</span>, <em>forbid that heaven should accomplish that </em>! (Od. 20. 234.) — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
