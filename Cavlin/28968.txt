<div class="comment-content"><p>By the term <em>administration, </em>he means what he had undertaken at the request of the Churches. Now what we render <em>functionem </em> (<em>service</em>)<em>, </em>is in the Greek <span class="lang el-gr">λειτουργία </span> term that sometimes denotes a sacrifice, sometimes any office that is publicly assigned. <span class="cite-ref">(730)</span> Either of them will suit this passage well. For on the one hand, it is no unusual thing for alms to be termed sacrifices; and, on the other hand, as on occasion of offices being distributed among citizens, <span class="cite-ref">(731)</span> no one grudges to undertake the duty that has been assigned him, so in the Church, imparting to others ought to be looked upon as a necessary duty. <span class="cite-ref">(732)</span> The Corinthians, therefore, and others, by assisting the brethren at Jerusalem, presented a sacrifice to God, or they discharged a service that was proper, and one which they were bound to fulfill. Paul was the minister of that sacrifice, but the term <em>ministry, </em>or <em>service, </em>may also be viewed as referring to the Corinthians. It is, however, of no particular importance. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(730)</span> The term <span class="lang el-gr">λειτουργία </span> is very frequently made use of in the Septuagint, in connection with the sacrifices and other services of the priests and Levites. (See <span class="bvs">Exo_38:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Num_4:24</span>, and <span class="bvs">Num_8:22</span>.) It is commonly employed by the Greek writers to denote a public service, more especially at Athens, discharged by the richer citizens at their own expense, and usually in rotation. The <span class="lang el-gr">λειτουργοὶ,</span> says <em>Potter, </em>in his Grecian Antiquities, (volume 1,) were “persons of considerable estates, who, by their own tribe, or the whole people, were ordered to perform some public duty, or supply the commonwealth with necessaries at their own expenses. Of these there were diverse sorts, all of which were elected out of twelve hundred of the richest citizens, who were appointed by the people to undergo, when they should be required, all the burdensome and chargeable offices in the commonwealth, every tribe electing an hundred and twenty out of their own body, though this was contrary to Solon’s constitution, by which every man, of what quality soever, was obliged to serve the public according to his ability, with this exception only, that two offices should not be imposed on the same person at once, as we are informed by Demosthenes, in his oration against Leptines, where he likewise mentions an ancient law, requiring every man to undergo some <span class="lang el-gr">λειτουργία </span> every second year.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(731)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les charges estans distribuees, en vne ville entre les citoyens d’icelle</span>;” — “Offices being distributed in a town among the citizens of it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(732)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ainsi en l’Eglise la communication consiste en ce que chacun s’acquitte enuers ses prochains de ce qu’il leur doit en charite</span>;” — “So in the Church, imparting to others consists in every one’s discharging to his neighbours, what he owes them, in love.” </p></div></div>
