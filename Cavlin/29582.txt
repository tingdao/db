<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>Exhorted</em>. He shews with what earnestness he devoted himself to their welfare, for he relates that in preaching to them respecting piety towards God and the duties of the Christian life, it had not been merely in a perfunctory way, <span class="cite-ref">(534)</span> but he says that he had made use of exhortations and <em>adjurations</em>. It is a lively preaching of the gospel, when persons are not merely told what is right, but are <em>pricked </em>(<span class="bvs">Act_2:37</span>) by exhortations, and are called to the judgment-seat of God, that they may not fall asleep in their vices, for this is what is properly meant by <em>adjuring</em>. But if pious men, whose promptitude Paul so highly commends, stood in absolute need of being stimulated by stirring exhortations, nay, <em>adjurations</em>, what must be done with us, in whom sluggishness <span class="cite-ref">(535)</span> of the flesh does more reign? In the mean time, as to the wicked, whose obstinacy is incurable, it is necessary to denounce upon them the horrible vengeance of God, not so much from hope of success, as in order that they may be rendered inexcusable. </p><p>Some render the participle <span class="lang el-gr">παραμυθουμένοι</span>, <em>comforted</em>. If we adopt this rendering, he means that he made use of consolations in dealing with the afflicted, who need to be sustained by the grace of God, and refreshed by tasting of heavenly blessings, <span class="cite-ref">(536)</span> that they may not lose heart or become impatient. The other meaning, however, is more suitable to the context, that he <em>admonished</em>; for the three verbs, it is manifest, refer to the same thing. </p><p><em>That ye might walk</em>. He presents in a few words the sum and substance of his exhortations, that, in magnifying the mercy of God, he admonished them not to fail as to their calling. His commendation of the grace of God is contained in the expression, <em>who hath called us into his kingdom</em>. For as our salvation is founded upon God’s gracious adoption, every blessing that Christ has brought us is comprehended in this one term. It now remains that we answer God’s call, that is, that we shew ourselves to be such children to him as he is a Father to us. For he who lives otherwise than as becomes a child of God, deserves to be cut off from God’s household. </p><p><strong>(534)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’y a point este par acquit, comme on dit</span>;” — “It had not been in the mere performance of a task, as they say.” </p><p><strong>(535)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La paresse et nonchalance de la chair</span>;” — “Indolence and negligence of the flesh.” </p><p><strong>(536)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Fortifiez ou soulagez en leur rafrechissant le goust des biens celestes</span>;” — “Strengthened or comforted in the way of refreshing their taste with heavenly blessings.” </p></div>
