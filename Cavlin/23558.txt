<div class="comment-content"><p>According to Matthew and Luke, Christ explains the parable to his disciples simply, and unaccompanied by a reproof; but according to Mark, he indirectly blames them for being slow of apprehension, because those who were to be the teachers of all did not run before others. <span class="cite-ref">(194)</span> The general truth conveyed is, that the doctrine of the Gospel, when it is scattered like seed, <span class="cite-ref">(195)</span> is not everywhere fruitful; because it does not always meet with a fertile and well cultivated soil. He enumerates four kinds of hearers: the first of which do not receive the seed; <span class="cite-ref">(196)</span> the second appear, indeed, to receive it, <span class="cite-ref">(197)</span> but in such a manner that it does not take deep root; in the third, the corn is choked; <span class="cite-ref">(198)</span> and so there remains a fourth part, which produces fruit. Not that one hearer only out of four, or ten out of forty, embrace the doctrine, and yield fruit; for Christ did not intend here to fix down an exact number, or to arrange the persons, of whom he speaks, in equal divisions; and, indeed, where the word is sown, the produce of faith is not always alike, but is sometimes more abundant, and at other times more scanty. He only intended to warn us, that, in many persons, the seed of life is lost on account of various defects, in consequence of which it is either destroyed immediately, or it withers, or it gradually degenerates. That we may derive the greater advantage from this warning, we ought to bear in mind, that he makes no mention of despisers who openly reject the word of God, but describes those only in whom there is some appearance of docility. But if the greater part of such men perish, what shall become of the rest of the world, by whom the doctrine of salvation is openly rejected? I now come down to each class. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(194)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne passent autrement les autres pour leur monstrer le chemin</span>;”— “did not go beyond others to show them the road.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(195)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estant espandue ca et la comme le b1e qu’on iette en terre</span>;”— “being scattered here and there, like the corn which is thrown into the earth.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(196)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Desquels les premiers ne retienent pas la semence en leurs coeurs pour germer</span>;” — “the first of which do not retain the seed in their hearts so as to spring up.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(197)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les seconds semblent bien l’avoir gardee iusques a venir a germer</span>;” — “the second appear to have kept it till it came to spring up.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(198)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Aux troisiemes, le ble estant en herbe est estouffe</span>;” — “in the third, the corn, while yet in the blade, is choked.” </p></div></div>
