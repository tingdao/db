<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_6:30</span><strong>.</strong><em>To every one that asketh of thee. </em>The same words, as we shall presently see, are found in Matthew: for it may readily be inferred from the context, that Luke does not here speak of a request to obtain assistance, but of actions at law, which bad men raise for the purpose of carrying off the property of others. <em>From him who takes away what are thine, ask them not again. </em>If it is thought better to read the two clauses separately, I have no objection: and then it will be an exhortation to liberality in giving. As to the second clause, in which Christ forbids us to <em>ask again </em>those things which have been unjustly taken away, it is undoubtedly an exposition of the former doctrine, that we ought to bear patiently <em>“ </em>the spoiling of our goods.” But we must remember what I have already hinted, that we ought not to quibble about words, as if a good man were not permitted to recover what is his own, when God gives him the lawful means. We are only enjoined to exercise patience, that we may not be unduly distressed by the loss of our property, but calmly wait, till the Lord himself shall call the robbers to account. </p></div>
