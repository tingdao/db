<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>To you it is given to know the mysteries </em><span class="cite-ref">(178)</span><em>of the kingdom of heaven </em>From this reply of Christ we learn, that the doctrine of salvation is proclaimed by God to men for various purposes; for Christ declares that he intentionally spoke obscurely, in order that his discourse might be a riddle to many, and might only strike their ears with a confused and doubtful sound. It will perhaps be objected, that this is inconsistent with that prophecy, </p><p>I have not spoken in secret, nor in a dark corner: I said not in vain to the seed of Jacob, Seek me, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_45:19</span>;) </p><p>or with the commendations which David pronounces on the Law, that it </p><p>is a lamp to the feet, and that it giveth wisdom to little children <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_119:105</span>.) </p><p>But the answer is easy: the word of God, in its own nature, is always bright, <span class="cite-ref">(179)</span> but its light is choked by the darkness of men. Though the Law was concealed, as it were, by a kind of veil, yet the truth, of God shone brightly in it, if the eyes of many had not been blinded. With respect to the Gospel, Paul affirms with truth, that it is <em>hidden </em>to none but to the reprobate, and to those who are devoted to destruction, <em>whose minds Satan hath blinded, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_4:3</span>.) Besides, it ought to be understood, that the power of enlightening which David mentions, and the familiar manner of teaching which Isaiah predicts, refer exclusively to the elect people. </p><p>Still it remains a fixed principle, that the word of God is not obscure, except so far as the world darkens it by its own blindness. And yet the Lord conceals its mysteries, so that the perception of them may not reach the reprobate. <span class="cite-ref">(180)</span> There are two ways in which he deprives them of the light of his doctrine. Sometimes he states, in a dark manner, what might be more clearly expressed; and sometimes he explains his mind fully, without ambiguity and without metaphor, but strikes their senses with dulness and their minds with stupidity, so that they are blind amidst bright sunshine. </p><p>Such is the import of those dreadful threatenings, in which Isaiah forewarns, that he will be to the people a barbarian, speaking in a foreign and unknown language; that the prophetical visions will be to the learned a shut and sealed book, in which they cannot read; and that when the book shall be opened, all will be <em>unlearned, </em>and will remain in amazement, through inability to read, (<span class="bvs">Isa_28:11</span>.) Now since Christ has purposely dispensed his doctrine in such a manner, that it might be profitable only to a small number, being firmly seated in their minds, and might hold others in suspense and perplexity, it follows that, by divine appointment, the doctrine of salvation is not proclaimed to all for the same end, but is so regulated by his wonderful purpose, that it is not less <em>a savor of death to death </em>to the reprobate than <em>a life-giving savor </em>to the elect, (<span class="bvs">2Co_2:15</span>.) And that no one may dare to murmur, Paul declares, in that passage that whatever may be the effect of the Gospel, its <em>savor, </em>though deadly, is always <em>a sweet savor </em>to God. </p><p>To ascertain fully the meaning of the present passage, we must examine more closely the design of Christ, the reason why, and the purpose for which, these words were spoken. First, the comparison is undoubtedly intended by Christ to exhibit the magnitude of the grace bestowed on his disciples, in having specially received what was not given indiscriminately to all. If it is asked, why this privilege was peculiar to the apostles, <span class="cite-ref">(181)</span> the reason certainly will not be found in themselves, and Christ, by declaring that it was <em>given </em>to them, excludes all merit. <span class="cite-ref">(182)</span> Christ declares that there are certain and elect men, on whom God specially bestows this honor of revealing to them his <em>secrets, </em>and that others are deprived of this grace. No other reason will be found for this distinction, except that God calls to himself those whom he has gratuitously elected. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(178)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De cognoistre les secrets</span>;” — “to know the secrets.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(179)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La parole de Dieu de sa nature est tousiours pleine de lumiere et clairte</span>;” — “the word of God in its own nature is always full of light and brightness.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(180)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Cependant neantmoins il ne laisse point d’estre vray, que le Seigneur tient ses secrets cachez, a fin que le goust et la fruition d’iceux ne parviene aux reprouvez</span>;” — “yet, nevertheless, it does not cease to be true, that the Lord keeps its secrets hidden, in order that the relish and enjoyment of them may not reach the reprobate.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(181)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si on demande d’ou venoit un tel privilege et honneur aux Apostres plustost aux autres</span>;” — “if it is asked, whence came such a privilege and honor to the Apostles rather than to the others.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(182)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Exclud toute merite de sa part</span>;” — “excludes all merit on their part.” </p></div></div>
