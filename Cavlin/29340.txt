The promise is — a long life; from which we are led to understand that the present life is not to be overlooked among the gifts of God. On this and other kindred subjects I must refer my reader to the <em>Institutes of the Christian Religion; </em><span class="cite-ref">(168)</span> satisfying myself at present with saying, in a few words, that the reward promised to the obedience of children is highly appropriate. Those who shew kindness to their parents from whom they derived life, are assured by God, that in this life it will <em>be well with them. </em></p><p><em>And that thou mayest live long on the earth. </em>Moses expressly mentions the land of Canaan, </p><p>“that thy days may be long upon the land which<LineBreak />the Lord thy God giveth thee.” (<span class="bvs">Exo_20:12</span>.) </p><p>Beyond this the Jews could not conceive of any life more happy or desirable. But as the same divine blessing is extended to the whole world, Paul has properly left out the mention of a place, the peculiar distinction of which lasted only till the coming of Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(168)</span> See volume 1 page 468. </p></div></div>
