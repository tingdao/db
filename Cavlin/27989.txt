<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>By the letter and circumcision, etc. </em>A construction <span class="cite-ref">(85)</span> which means a literal circumcision. He does not mean that they violated the law, because they had the literal circumcision; but because they continued, though they had the outward rite, to neglect the spiritual worship of God, even piety, justice, judgment, and truth, which are the chief matters of the law. <span class="cite-ref">(86)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(85)</span><em>Hypallage, </em>substitution, a figure of speech, by which a noun or an adjective is put in a form different from its obvious import. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(86)</span> The rendering of this clause is rather obscure, “who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law.” The preposition<span class="lang el-gr">, διὰ, </span> has no doubt the meaning of <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν </span> or <span class="lang el-gr">σύν</span>, as in some other passages, as in <span class="bvs">Rom_4:11</span><span class="lang el-gr">, δἰ ἀκροβυστίας </span> — in uncircumcision, and in <span class="bvs">Rom_8:25</span><span class="lang el-gr">, δἰ ῦπομονὢς </span> — in or with patience. Then the version should be, “who, <em>being </em>with, or having, the letter and circumcision, dost transgress the law.” The “letter” means the written law. That this is the meaning is evident from the context. Both [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] give the same construction. It is better to take “letter,” <em>i.e</em>. , the law, and “circumcision” separate, than to amalgamate them by a rhetorical figure, as is done by [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] and others. [<span class="bvs">Hodge </span>] justly says, that this is “more suited to the context, as nothing is said here of spiritual circumcision.” </p><p>The word<span class="lang el-gr">γράμμα, </span> letter, has various meanings — 1. What is commonly called letter, the character, <span class="bvs">Luk_23:38</span>, — 2. What is written, a bond or contract, <span class="bvs">Luk_16:6</span>; — 3. In the plural, letters, epistles, <span class="bvs">Act_28:21</span>; — 4. The written law, as here, and in the plural, the Old Testament Scriptures, <span class="bvs">2Ti_3:15</span>; — 5. What is conveyed by writing, learning, <span class="bvs">Joh_7:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Act_26:24</span>; — and, 6. The outward performance of the law, it being written, as opposed to what is spiritual or inward, as in the last verse of this chapter, and in <span class="bvs">2Co_3:6</span>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
