<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet represents here as in a lively picture, what was nigh the Assyrians; for he sets forth the Chaldeans their enemies, with all their preparations and in their quick movements. <span class="cite-ref">(239)</span><em>The sound of the whip, </em>he says; the whips, made a noise in exciting the horses: <em>the sound of the rattling of the wheel; </em>that is, great shall be the haste and celerity, when the horses shall be forced on by the whip; <em>the horse </em>also shaking the earth, <em>and the chariot bounding; the horseman making it to ascend; </em>and then, <em>the flame of the sword and the lightning of the spear </em>He then says, that there would be such a slaughter, that the whole place would be full of dead bodies. </p><p>We now then understand what the Prophet means: for as Nineveh might have then appeared impregnable the Prophet confirms at large what he had said of its approaching ruin, and thus sets before the eyes of the Israelites what was then incredible. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(239)</span> It appears from <em>Marckius </em>that <em>Theodoret </em>and <em>Cyril </em>regarded this verse, with <em>Calvin, </em>as a description of the Chaldean army after having invaded Nineveh, but that <em>Jerome </em>and <em>Cocceius </em>viewed it as a delineation of the state of Nineveh in the Prophet’s time; and with the last <em>Newcome </em>agrees, while <em>Henderson </em>coincides with the former. The version given by them is all nearly the same. It seems certainly more consistent with the order of the poem to regard the verse as describing the state of Nineveh at the time, for the sacking of Nineveh had been before very minutely delineated. Having done this, the Prophet may be supposed to give here a reason for the dreadful catastrophe which he had mentioned. Entertaining this view, and differing from others as to the meaning of some of the clauses, I offer the following version of the three verses, — </p><p><em>1. Oh! The city of blood! All of deceit; </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Of plunder it is full, none can search out the spoil: </em>— </p><p><em>2. The sound of the whip, and the sound of the rattling wheel! </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And the horse prancing, and the chariot bounding! </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>The horseman mounting, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And the flaming of the sword and the glittering of the spear! </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And a multitude dancing, and a mass inactive! </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And no end to her people! </em><em><LineBreak /></em>Who<em>are fallen, with their nations, </em></p><p><em>3. Through the many fornications of the harlot, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>That exults in beauty, </em>and<em>possesses enchantments; </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Who sells nations by her fornications, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And tribes by her enchantments. </em></p><p><span class="lang he-il">ימיש</span>, “search out,” I derive from <span class="lang he-il">מש</span>, which is to feel for the purpose of exploring, and then, to explore or search out; see <span class="bvs">Gen_31:34</span>. The second verse contains a simple enumeration of what the city exhibited. <span class="lang he-il">רב חלל</span>, “a multitude dancing” or piping, the <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> being dropped in <span class="lang he-il">חלל</span>, as it is in <span class="lang he-il">חללים</span>, pipers, <span class="bvs">1Kg_1:40</span>. Then as a contrast comes the dead, heavy, inactive mass, <span class="lang he-il">כבד פגד</span>. “To her people” or nations, <span class="lang he-il">לגויה</span>, <span class="lang el-gr">τοις εθνεσιν αυτης</span>. — <em>Sept. </em>In the word <span class="lang he-il">בנויתם</span>, I take that <span class="lang he-il">ת</span> is a mistake for <span class="lang he-il">ה</span>. If taken for carcasses, it wants a <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> before <span class="lang he-il">ת</span>; see <span class="bvs">Psa_110:6</span>. The third verse must be connected with the second, as it has otherwise no grammatical construction. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
