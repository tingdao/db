<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong>And Luke describeth therewithal that he was furnished with weapons and power to do hurt, when as he saith that he had <em>obtained </em>letters of the highest priest, that he might bring all those bound to Jerusalem whom he should find professing the name of Christ. There is mention made of women, that it may the better appear how desirous he was to shed blood who had no respect of sex whom even armed enemies are wont to spare in the heat of war. Therefore he setteth forth before us a fierce and cruel beast who had not only liberty given him to rage, but had also his power increased to devour and destroy godly men, as if a madman had a sword put into his hand. Whereas I have translated it sect, Luke hath way, which metaphor is common enough in the Scriptures. Therefore Paulâ€™s purpose was quite to put out the name of Christ by destroying all the godly cruelly. </p></div>
