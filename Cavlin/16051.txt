<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>152</strong><em>. I have known from thy testimonies </em><span class="cite-ref">(24)</span><em>from the beginning. </em>Others here translate, <em>I have known long ago of thy testimonies. </em><span class="cite-ref">(25)</span> This translation I would not directly reject; but I am more inclined to retain the sense which I have given, namely, That the Prophet not only knew the everlasting steadfastness which characterizes the testimonies of God; but that he had also derived this knowledge from the testimonies themselves. When the Hebrews would express the meaning conveyed by the Latin preposition <em>de, </em>they frequently use the particle <span class="lang he-il">מן</span>, or the letter <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, <em>beth. </em>He therefore says, that he had learned from God’s testimonies, or had been taught by them, that <em>they are established for ever </em><span class="cite-ref">(26)</span> This indeed is the chief point of faith, That the word of God is not only distinguished for fidelity and steadfastness for a time, but that it continues unchangeable for ever. Were it otherwise, it could not include within it the hope of eternal salvation. That the assurance of this immutabiliy of God’s word may be rooted in our minds, the inward revelation of the Holy Spirit is indeed necessary; for until God seal within us the certainty of his word, our belief of its certainty will be continually wavering. Yet the Prophet, not without cause, affirms, that he learned this truth from the word; for when God shines into us by his Spirit, he at the same time causes that sacred truth which endures for ever to shine forth in the mirror of his word. </p><p><strong>(24)</strong> “De testimoniis tuis.” —<em>Lat. </em></p><p><strong>(25)</strong> Walford’s rendering is, “I have known thy testimonies long since.” Phillips translates “of old;” and gives this explanation, “I have been acquainted with thy testimonies ever since I have possessed any knowledge, i.e. as soon as I came to years of reflection. </p><p>‘From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures.’ <LineBreak /><span class="bvs">2Ti_3:15</span>.” </p><p><strong>(26)</strong><em>Thou hast established them for ever. </em>That is, thy revelations are unalterable and everlasting, as the attributes of their great Author, and can never fail those who rely upon them, in time, or in eternity.” —<em>Warner on the Psalter. </em></p></div>
