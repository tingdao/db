<div class="comment-content"><p>Here Christ only explains the reason why that condition was added, <em>Forgive us, as we forgive </em>The reason is, that God will not be ready to hear us, unless we also show ourselves ready to grant forgiveness to those who have offended us. If we are not harder than iron, this exhortation ought to soften us, and render us disposed to forgive offenses. <span class="cite-ref">(445)</span> Unless God pardon us every day many sins, we know that we are ruined in innumerable ways: and on no other condition does he admit us to pardon, but that we pardon our brethren whatever offenses they have committed against us. Those who refuse to forget the injuries which have been done to them, devote themselves willingly and deliberately to destruction, and knowingly prevent God from forgiving them. <span class="cite-ref">(446)</span></p><p><strong>(445)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour nous rendre faciles a oublier les injures qu'on nous a faites</span>.” — “To make us ready to forget the injuries which have been done to us.” </p><p><strong>(446)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et de propos delibere veulent que Dieu procede contre eux en toute rigueur</span>;” — “and deliberately resolve that God may proceed against them to the utmost rigor.” </p></div>
