<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people </em>This was a kind of application of the sacrifice, in order that the people might know that God was reconciled to them through the priest as their mediator and surety. The form of benediction <span class="cite-ref">(414)</span> has been already expoundled; at present let this one point suffice, that, when by the lifting up of their hands the priests testified of God’s paternal favor to the people, their commission was ratified and efficacious. Of this the sacred history presents to us a memorable instance, where it records, that </p><p>“the priests and Levites blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling-place, even unto heaven.” (<span class="bvs">2Ch_30:27</span>.) </p><p>The fulfilment of this type was at length manifested in Christ, who is not only the source and cause of blessing, but publishes it by the Gospel with effectual results; for He came to “preach peace to them which were afar off, and to them that were nigh,” (<span class="bvs">Eph_2:17</span>;) and although He does not appear or speak in a visible form, yet we know what He says, viz., that </p><p>“whatsoever His disciples shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever they shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” (<span class="bvs">Mat_18:18</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(414)</span> See <em>ante </em>on <span class="bvs">Num_6:22</span>, vol. 2, p. 245 <em>et seq</em>. </p></div></div>
