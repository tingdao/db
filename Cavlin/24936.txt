<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>42.</strong><em>Blessed art thou </em>She seems to put Mary and Christ on an equal footing, which would have been highly improper. But I cheerfully agree with those who think that the second clause assigns the reason; for <em>and </em>often signifies <em>because. </em>Accordingly, Elisabeth affirms, that her cousin was <em>blessed </em>on account of the blessedness of her child. To carry Christ in her womb was not Maryâ€™s first <em>blessedness, </em>but was greatly inferior to the distinction of being born again by the Spirit of God to a new life. Yet she is justly called <em>blessed, </em>on whom God bestowed the remarkable honor of bringing into the world his own Son, through whom she had been spiritually renewed. And at this day, the blessedness brought to us by Christ cannot be the subject of our praise, without reminding us, at the same time, of the distinguished honor which God was pleased to bestow on Mary, in making her the mother of his Only Begotten Son. </p></div>
