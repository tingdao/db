<div class="comment-content"><p>He repeats what he has already said—that the helps which the Jews hoped would be in readiness to prevent God’s vengeance would be vain. For though men dare not openly to resist God, yet they hope by some winding courses to find out some way by which they may avert his judgment. As then the Jews, trusting in their wealth, and in their fortified cities, became insolent towards God, the Prophet here declares, that neither <em>gold nor silver </em>should be a help to them. Let them, he says, accumulate wealth; though by the mass of their gold and silver they form high mountains for themselves, yet they shall not be able to turn aside the hand of God, nor be able to deliver themselves,—and why? He repeats again the same thing, that it would be <em>the day of wrath</em>. We indeed know, that the most savage enemies are sometimes pacified by money, for avarice mitigates their cruelty; but the Prophet declares here, that as God would be the ruler in that war, there would be no redemption, and therefore money would be useless: for God could by no means receive them into favor, except they repented and truly humbled themselves before him. </p><p>He therefore adds, that the land would be <em>devoured by the fire of God’s jealousy</em>, or indignation. He compares God’s wrath to fire; for no agreement can be made when fire rages, but the more materials there are the more will there be to increase the fire. So then the Prophet excludes the Jews from any hope of deliverance, except they reconciled themselves to God by true and sincere repentance; <em>for a consummation</em>, he says, <em>he will make as to all the inhabitants of the land, and one indeed very quick </em>or speedy. <span class="cite-ref">(89)</span> In short, he means, that as the Jews had hardened themselves against every instruction, they would find God’s vengeance to be such as would wholly consume them, as they would not anticipate it, but on the contrary enhance it by their pride and stupidity, and even deride it. Now follows— </p><p><strong>(89)</strong> Quickness rather than terror is what is evidently meant. See version 14. Most agree in this respect. <em>Newcome </em>renders it “speedy,” and <em>Henderson </em>“sudden.” The word “riddance,” for [<span class="lang he-il">כלה</span> ], in our version, is improper. It is rendered “full end” by <em>Newcome</em>, and “consummation” by <em>Henderson</em>, and<span class="lang el-gr">“συντέλειαν—</span> end” by the Septuagint. The particle [<span class="lang he-il">אך</span> ] does not mean “altogether,” as rendered by <em>Henderson</em>, but it is an asseveration—surely, indeed, certainly, doubtless. The [<span class="lang he-il">אח</span> ] before “inhabitants” has evidently here the meaning of<span class="lang el-gr">κατα, </span> with regard to. It is rendered<span class="lang el-gr">επι, </span> upon, in the Septuagint, and “with” by <em>Marckius </em>and <em>Newcome</em>. The whole verse is as follows,— </p><p><strong>18.</strong>Neither their silver nor their gold <LineBreak />Shall be able to deliver them <LineBreak />In the day of the extreme-wrath of Jehovah; <LineBreak />By the fire of his jealousy <LineBreak />Shall be consumed the whole land; <LineBreak />For an end, doubtless sudden, will he make, <LineBreak />As to all the inhabitants of the land. </p></div>
