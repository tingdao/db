Still I am rather disposed Lo think that by <em>height </em>he denotes its excellency; inasmuch as that land, on account of its illustrious endowments, was, as it were, the most noble theater in the world. </p><p>Moses celebrates its fertility, when he says that the people <em>sucked honey from the rock and oil from the stones: </em>for he means to indicate, that no part of it was unproductive, since they gathered honey from the rocks, and upon them also the olive grew. The same is the intention of the other figures, that they ate “butter of kine, and milk of sheep;” by which he signifies that the land was full of rich pastures. By “fat of lambs,” he undoubtedly means the plumpness of their flesh, because it was not lawful to eat their actual fat; but it is not unusual to denote by this word any kind of richness, as soon afterwards he calls the best meal or flour, from which the more delicate kind of bread was made, “the fat of wheat.” With respect to the wine, he magnifies God’s liberality by the use of a poetic figure, when he says they <em>drank of the blood of the grape. </em>There is no doubt but that he alludes to its color; yet he takes occasion to extol more highly the <em>beneficence </em>of God, by intimating that, when the juice of the grapes is expressed, it is just as if their blood flowed forth for the nutriment of men. Since, then, the metaphor is taken from the redness of wine, I have not hesitated to translate the epithet <span class="lang he-il">חמר</span>, <em>chamer, </em>at the end of the verse, <em>red. </em><span class="cite-ref">(263)</span> From many passages it appears to have been very delicious; and in <span class="bvs">Isa_27:2</span> the word <span class="lang he-il">חמר</span>, <em>chamer, </em>is used for a vine of great preciousness and of exquisite flavor. Those who render it <em>pure, </em>have rather taken into consideration the fact, than the signification of the word. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(262)</span> “In summa parte orbis, qubd Terra Saneta sit in medio climate mund” — Vatablus, in Poole’s Synopsis. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(263)</span> It may either mean <em>red </em>or <em>effervescing; </em>it is not easy to see why <em>A.
