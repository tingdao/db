He then adds,<em>for ever, </em>that we may now form some idea of his eternal kingdom, which will make known to us his full and perfect glory. </p><p>END OF THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER </p><p><strong>(186)</strong> “Grace” is the attainment, and “the knowledge” of Christ is the way and means. The chief thing is often mentioned first in Scripture, then that which leads to it: or the cause of it. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
