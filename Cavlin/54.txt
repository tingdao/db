<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And Adam said, etc </em>It is demanded whence Adam derived this knowledge since he was at that time buried in deep sleep. If we say that his quickness of perception was then such as to enable him by conjecture to form a judgment, the solution would be weak. But we ought not to doubt that God would make the whole course of the affair manifest to him, either by secret revelation or by his word; for it was not from any necessity on God’s part that He borrowed from man the rib out of which he might form the woman; but he designed that they should be more closely joined together by this bonds which could not have been effected unless he had informed them of the fact. Moses does not indeed explain by what means God gave them this information; yet unless we would make the work of God superfluous, we must conclude that its Author revealed both the fact itself and the method and design of its accomplishment. The deep sleep was sent upon Adam, not to hide from him the origin of his wife, but to exempt him from pain and trouble, until he should receive a compensation so excellent for the loss of his rib. </p><p><em>This is now bone of, etc </em><span class="cite-ref">(149)</span> In using the expression <span class="lang he-il">הפעם</span> (<em>hac vice</em>,) Adam indicates that something had been wanting to him; as if he had said, Now at length I have obtained a suitable companion, who is part of the substance of my flesh, and in whom I behold, as it were, another self. And he gives to his wife a name taken from that of man, <span class="cite-ref">(150)</span> that by this testimony and this mark he might transmit a perpetual memorial of the wisdom of God. A deficiency in the Latin language has compelled the ancient interpreter to render <span class="lang he-il">אשה</span> (<em>ishah</em>,) by the word <em>virago</em>. It is, however, to be remarked, that the Hebrew term means nothing else than the female of the man. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(149)</span> “Hac vice os est ex ossibus meis.” <span class="lang he-il">זאת הפעם</span>, (<em>zot haphaam</em>.) These words are rendered in the English version by “This now,” which very feebly and imperfectly expresses the sense of the original; nor does the version of Calvin, “At this turn,” give the true emphasis of the words. It is perhaps scarcely possible to do so without a paraphrase. The two words of the original are both intended to be emphatic. “This living creature (<span class="lang he-il">זאת</span>) which at the present time (<span class="lang he-il">הפעם</span>, <em>hac vice</em>) passes before me, is the companion which I need, for it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.” — Vide Dathe in loco. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(150)</span> “Nomen uxori a viro imponit.” <span class="lang he-il">אשה</span>, (<em>ishah</em>,) from <span class="lang he-il">איש</span>, (<em>ish</em>,) which is the Hebrew word man with a feminine termination; as if we should say, “She shall be called manness, because she was taken out of the man.” Calvin uses the word virissa; Dathe, after Le Clerc, the word vira; and though neither of them are strictly classical, yet are they far preferable to the term virago in the Vulgate, which Calvin justly rejects, and which means a woman of masculine character. The English word woman is a contraction of womb-man. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
