<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>For this cause</em>, etc. After having treated in a general way of <em>unworthy eating</em>, and of the kind of punishment that awaits those who pollute this sacrament, he now instructs the Corinthians as to the chastisement which they were at that time enduring. It is not known whether a pestilence was raging there at that time, or whether they were laboring under other kinds of disease. However it may have been as to this, we infer from Paul’s words, that the Lord had sent some scourge upon them for their correction. Nor does Paul merely conjecture, that it is on that account that they are punished, but he affirms it as a thing that was perfectly well known by him. He says, then, that <em>many lay sick </em>— that many were kept long in a languishing condition, and that many had died, in consequence of that abuse of the Supper, because they had offended God. By this he intimates, that by diseases and other chastisements from God, we are admonished to think of our sins; for God does not afflict us without good reason, for he takes no pleasure in our afflictions. </p><p>The subject is a copious and ample one; but let it suffice to advert to it here in a single word. If in Paul’s times an ordinary abuse of the Supper <span class="cite-ref">(710)</span> could kindle the wrath of God against the Corinthians, so that he punished them thus severely, what ought we to think as to the state of matters at the present day? We see, throughout the whole extent of Popery, not merely horrid profanations of the Supper, but even a sacrilegious abomination set up in its room. In the <em>first </em>place, it is prostituted to <em>filthy lucre </em>(<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:8</span>) and merchandise. <em>Secondly</em>, it is maimed, by taking away the use of the cup. <em>Thirdly</em>, it is changed into another aspect, <span class="cite-ref">(711)</span> by its having become customary for one to partake of his own feast separately, participation being done away. <span class="cite-ref">(712)</span><em>Fourthly</em>, there is <em>there </em>no explanation of the meaning of the sacrament, but a mumbling that would accord better with a magical incantation, or the detestable <em>sacrifices </em>of the Gentiles, than with our Lord’s institution. <em>Fifthly</em>, there is an endless number of ceremonies, abounding partly with trifles, partly with superstition, and consequently manifest pollutions. <em>Sixthly</em>, there is the diabolical invention of sacrifice, which contains an impious blasphemy against the death of Christ. <em>Seventhly</em>, it is fitted to intoxicate miserable men with carnal <em>confidence</em>, while they present it to God as if it were an expiation, and think that by this charm they drive off everything hurtful, and that without faith and repentance. Nay more, while they trust that they are armed against the devil and death, and are fortified against God by a sure defense, they venture to sin with much more freedom, <span class="cite-ref">(713)</span> and become more obstinate. <em>Eighthly</em>, an idol is <em>there </em>adored in the room of Christ. In short, it is filled with all kinds of abomination. <span class="cite-ref">(714)</span></p><p>Nay even among ourselves, who have the pure administration of the Supper restored to us, <span class="cite-ref">(715)</span> in virtue of a return, as it were, from captivity, <span class="cite-ref">(716)</span> how much irreverence! How much hypocrisy on the part of many! What a disgraceful mixture, while, without any discrimination, wicked and openly abandoned persons intrude themselves, such as no man of character and decency would admit to common intercourse! <span class="cite-ref">(717)</span> And yet after all, we wonder how it comes that there are so many wars, so many pestilences, so many failures of the crop, so many disasters and calamities — as if the cause were not manifest! And assuredly, we must not expect a termination to our calamities, until we have removed the occasion of them, by correcting our faults. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(710)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vn tel abus de la Cene qui n’estoit pas des plus grans</span>;” — “Such an abuse of the Supper, as was not one of the greatest.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(711)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vne forme estrange et du tout autre</span>;” — “A strange and quite different form.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(712)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sans en distribuer ne communiquer aux autres</span>;” — “Without distributing or communicating of it to others.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(713)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils pechent plus audacieusement, et a bride auallee</span>;” — “They sin more daringly, and with a loose bridle.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(714)</span> The above paragraph is aptly designated in the old English translation by Thomas Tymme, (1573) “a lyuely description of the Popishe Masse.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(715)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le pur vsage de la Cene en son entier, qui nous a este finalement rendu par la grace de Dieu</span>;” — “The pure use of the Supper in its completeness, which has been at last restored to us by the grace of God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(716)</span> Calvin here employs the term <em>postliminum </em>, (<em>restoration from captivity</em>,) and most felicitously compares the restoration of the pure observance of religious ordinances, consequent upon the Reformation from Popery, to the recovery, by a Roman citizen, of his superior privileges, on his return from a state of captivity, during which they had been — not forfeited — but merely suspended. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(717)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lesquels vn homme de bien, et qui auroit honnestete en quelque recommendation, ne receuroit iamais a sa table</span>;” — “Whom a man of principle — that had any regard to decency — would never admit to his table.” </p></div></div>
