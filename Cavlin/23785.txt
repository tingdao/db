But if we are not prepared to endure poverty, it is manifest that covetousness reigns in us. And this is what I said at the outset, that the order which Christ gave, to <em>sell all that he had</em>, was not an addition to the law, but the scrutiny of a concealed vice. <span class="cite-ref">(629)</span> For the more deeply a man is tainted by this or the other vice, the more strikingly will it be dragged forth to light by being reproved. We are reminded also by this example that, if we would persevere steadily in the school of Christ, we must renounce the flesh. This <em>young man</em>, who had brought both a desire to learn and modesty, withdrew from Christ, because it was hard to part with a darling vice. The same thing will happen to us, unless the sweetness of the grace of Christ render all the allurements of the flesh distasteful to us. Whether or not this temptation was temporary, so that the <em>young man </em>afterwards repented, we know not; but it may be conjectured with probability, that his covetousness kept him back from making any proficiency. </p><p><strong>(629)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que c’a este pour sonder et descouvrir un vice cache</span>;” — “that it was to search and discover a concealed vice.” </p></div>
