<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Take ye from among you an offering. </em>I have introduced a passage from chapter 35, wherein Moses again requires what he had before prescribed; but he goes more into detail, and treats at greater length of the parts of the tabernacle. In the former passage he employed a verb, where he here uses a noun, “willing or voluntary of heart.” There is, however, no ambiguity in the meaning; since in both places God requires a cheerful zeal, so that they may not only contribute abundantly, but willingly. He will afterwards use a different form of expression, viz., that <em>they </em>did their duty, whose heart roused, or stirred them up, so as to distinguish them from the indifferent and slow. — 5:21. </p></div>
