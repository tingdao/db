<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>If ye are dead</em>. He had previously said, that the ordinances were fastened to the cross of Christ. (<span class="bvs">Col_2:14</span>.) He now employs another figure of speech — that we are <em>dead </em>to them, as he teaches us elsewhere, that we are <em>dead to the law</em>, and the law, on the other hand, to us. (<span class="bvs">Gal_2:19</span>.) The term death means abrogation, <span class="cite-ref">(416)</span> but it is more expressive <em>and more emphatic</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">καὶ ἐμφατικώτερον</span>.) He says, therefore, that the Colossians, have nothing to do with ordinances. Why? Because they have died with Christ to ordinances; that is, after they died with Christ by regeneration, they were, through his kindness, set free from ordinances, that they may not belong to them any more. Hence he concludes that they are by no means bound by the ordinances, which the false apostles endeavored to impose upon them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(416)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et abolissement</span>;” — “And abolishment.” </p></div></div>
