<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Give ear, O my people! to my law. </em>From the close of the psalm, it may with probability be conjectured, that it was written long after the death of David; for there we have celebrated the kingdom erected by God in the family of David. There also the tribe of Ephraim, which is said to have been rejected, is contrasted with, and set in opposition to, the house of David. From this it is evident, that the ten tribes were at that time in a state of separation from the rest of the chosen people; for there must be some good reason why the kingdom of Ephraim is branded with a mark of dishonor as being illegitimate and bastard. <span class="cite-ref">(308)</span></p><p>Whoever was the inspired writer of this psalm, he does not introduce God speaking as is thought by some, but he himself addresses the Jews in the character of a teacher. It is no objection to this that he calls the people <em>his people, </em>and the law <em>his law; </em>it being no uncommon thing for the prophets to borrow the name of Him by whom they were sent, that their doctrine might have the greater authority. And, indeed, the truth which has been committed to their trust may, with propriety, be called <em>theirs. </em>Thus Paul, in <span class="bvs">Rom_2:16</span>, glories in the gospel as <em>his gospel, </em>an expression not to be understood as implying that it was a system which owed its origin to him, but that he was a preacher and a witness of it. I am somewhat doubtful whether interpreters are strictly correct in translating the word <span class="lang he-il">תורה</span><em>, torah, </em>by law. <span class="cite-ref">(309)</span> The meaning of it seems to be somewhat more general, as appears from the following clause, where the Psalmist uses the phrase,<em>the words of my mouth, </em>in the same sense. If we consider with what inattention even those who make great professions of being the disciples of God listen to his voice, we will admit that the prophet had good reason for introducing his lessons of instruction by a solemn call of attention. He does not, it is true, address the unteachable and obstinate, who frowardly refuse to submit themselves to the word of God; but as even true believers themselves are generally too backward to receive instruction, this exhortation, so far from being superfluous, was highly necessary to stir up the sluggish and inactive among them. </p><p>To secure for himself the greater attention, he declares it to be his purpose to discuss subjects of a great, high, and difficult character. The word <span class="lang he-il">משל</span>, <em>mashal, </em>which I have translated <em>a parable, </em>denotes grave and striking sentences, such as adages, or proverbs, and apophthegms. <span class="cite-ref">(310)</span> As then the matter itself of which we treat, if it is weighty and important, awakens the minds of men, the inspired penman affirms that it is his purpose to utter only striking sentences and notable sayings. The word <span class="lang he-il">חידות</span>, <em>chidoth, </em>which, following others, I have rendered <em>enigmas, </em>is here used, not so much for dark sentences, as for sayings which are pointed and worthy of special notice. <span class="cite-ref">(311)</span> He does not mean to wrap up his song in ambiguous language, but clearly and distinctly to dwell both upon the benefits of God and the ingratitude of the people. Only, as I have said, his design is to stimulate his readers to weigh and consider more attentively the subject propounded. This passage is quoted by Matthew, (<span class="bvs">Mat_13:35</span>,) and applied to the person of Christ, when he held the minds of the people in suspense by parables which they could not understand. Christ’s object in doing so, was to prove that he was a distinguished prophet of God, and that thus he might be received with the greater reverence. Since he then resembled a prophet because he preached sublime mysteries in a style of language above the common kind, that which the sacred writer here affirms concerning himself, is with propriety transferred to him. If in this psalm there shines forth such a majesty as may justly stir up and inflame the readers with a desire to learn, we gather from it with what earnest attention it becomes us to receive the gospel, in which Christ opens and displays to us the treasures of his celestial wisdom. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(308)</span> Calmet refers the composition of this psalm to the days of Asa, who, aided by the Syrians, obtained a signal victory over the Israelites, and brought back to the pure worship of God many out of the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon. See <span class="bvs">2Ch_15:0</span> and <span class="bvs">2Ch_16:0</span>. Schnurrer supposes, that the special purpose for which it was composed was, to celebrate a decisive victory which had been gained over the kingdom of Ephraim or Israel by Abijah, the king of Judah during the reign of Jeroboam. Walford thinks this opinion highly probable. “There is,” say’s he, “an eulogy passed upon David at the conclusion of the psalm, which makes it likely that the author of it wished to conciliate the favor of the whole people towards David’s successors, from whom Jeroboam had revolted: and in verse 9<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, there is a reference to Ephraim which affords some degree of evidence in support of Schnurrer’s hypothesis. Whatever may be thought of this hypothesis, we cannot hesitate to admit that the psalm itself is clear, pungent, and persuasive, and must have been felt to be so by the persons for whose use it was written.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(309)</span> We have seen that Calvin, on the margin of the French version, reads <em>instruction</em>, and this reading is adopted by Street, Fry, Morison, and Walford. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(310)</span> See volume 2, page 238, note 2. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(311)</span> Walford translates <span class="lang he-il">חידות</span>, <em>chidoth</em>, “all impressive record.” His version of the first and second verses is, </p><p>“Hear, O my people! my instruction: <LineBreak />Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. <LineBreak />I will open my mouth with an instructive speech, <LineBreak />I will utter an impressive record of ancient times.” </p><p>“The words <em>law</em>, <em>parable</em>, and <em>dark sayings</em>, ” he observes, “which are found in the English translation of verses 1<span class="cite-ref">st</span> and 2d, are not appropriate to the recitals which are contained in the psalm. They are here altered for others, which are in agreement with the subjects which follow, and may be supported by the usage of the original words which are employed.” Similar is Street’s note on this place. He translates <span class="lang he-il">חידות</span>, <em>chidoth</em>, “pointed truths,” and objects to its being translated <em>dark sayings </em>“There is nothing obscure in the psalm,” says he, “it contains instructive historical truth, but no enigma. Therefore, the rendering of the English Bible, <em>dark sayings</em>, does not seem to be right. The Septuagint renders the word <span class="lang el-gr">διηγημα</span>, <span class="bvs">Eze_17:2</span>, and that rendering would suit this place better than <span class="lang el-gr">προθληματα</span> I have endeavored to express the relation of the word to <span class="lang he-il">חדד</span>, <em>acutum est </em>.” See volume 2 of this work, page 238, note 3. But as Dimock observes, “The several transactions of the Mosaical covenant hereafter recited, might be well called <em>parables </em>and <em>dark speeches</em>, or, as Arabic, <em>mysteries</em>, considered as types or figures of the Christian; and viewed in this light, afford ample matter of contemplation, serving not only as a schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, but to keep us steadfast in faith and obedience to David our king.” </p></div></div>
