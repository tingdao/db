<div class="comment-content"><p>It is afterwards added — A <em>herald cried out lustily, or </em>among the multitude. This latter explanation does not suit so well — the herald crying amidst the multitude — -since there were a great concourse of nations, and the kingdom of Babylon comprehended many provinces. <em>The herald, </em>therefore, <em>cried with a loud voice, An edict is gone forth for you, O nations, peoples, and tongues. </em>This would strike them with terror, since the king made no exception to his command for every province to worship his idol; for each person would observe the rest, and when every one sees the whole multitude <em>obedient, </em>no one would dare to refuse; hence all liberty is at an end. It now follows, — When <em>ye hear the sound of the trumpet or horn, harp, pipe, psaltery, sackbut, etc ., ye must fall down and adore the image. But whoever did not fall down before it, should be cast the same hour into a burning fiery furnace. </em>This would excite the greater terror, since King Nebuchadnezzar sanctioned this impious worship with a punishment so severe; for he was not content with a usual kind of death, but commanded every one who did not worship the statue to be cast into the fire. Now, this denunciation of punishment sufficiently demonstrates now the king suspected some of rebellion. There would have been no dispute if Jews had not been mixed with Chaldeans and Assyrians, for they always worshipped the same gods, and it was a prevailing custom with them to worship those deities whom their kings approved. Hence it appears that the statue was purposely erected to give the king an opportunity of accurately ascertaining whether the Jews, as yet unaccustomed to Gentile superstitions, were obedient to his command. He wished to cause the sons of Abraham to lay aside sincere piety, and to submit to his corruption’s, by following the example of others, and framing their conduct according to the king’s will and the practice of the people among whom they dwelt. But we shall treat this hereafter. </p></div>
