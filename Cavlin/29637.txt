<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>Rejoice always</em>. I refer this to moderation of spirit, when the mind keeps itself in calmness under adversity, and does not give indulgence to grief. I accordingly connect together these three things — <em>to rejoice always, to pray without ceasing, and to give thanks to God in all things</em>. For when he recommends constant praying, he points out the way of rejoicing perpetually, for by this means we ask from God alleviation in connection with all our distresses. In like manner, in <span class="bvs">Phi_4:4</span>, having said, </p><p>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, Rejoice. Let your moderation be known to all. Be not anxious as to anything. The Lord is at hand. </p><p>He afterwards points out the means of this— </p><p>but in every prayer let your requests be made known to God, with giving of thanks. </p><p>In that passage, as we see, he presents as a source of joy a calm and composed mind, that is not unduly disturbed by injuries or adversities. But lest we should be borne down by grief, sorrow, anxiety, and fear, he bids us repose in the providence of God. And as doubts frequently obtrude themselves as to whether God cares for us, he also prescribes the remedy — that by prayer we disburden our anxieties, as it were, into his bosom, as David commands us to do in <span class="bvs">Psa_37:5</span> and <span class="bvs">Psa_55:22</span>; and Peter also, after his example. (<span class="bvs">1Pe_5:7</span>.) As, however, we are unduly precipitate in our desires, he imposes a check upon them — that, while we desire what we are in need of, we at the same time do not cease to give thanks. </p><p>He observes, here, almost the same order, though in fewer words. For, in the first place, he would have us hold God’s benefits in such esteem, that the recognition of them and meditation upon them shall overcome all sorrow. And, unquestionably, if we consider what Christ has conferred upon us, there will be no bitterness of grief so intense as may not be alleviated, and give way to spiritual joy. For if this joy does not reign in us, the kingdom of God is at the same time banished from us, or we from it. <span class="cite-ref">(609)</span> And very ungrateful is that man to God, who does not set so high a value on the righteousness of Christ and the hope of eternal life, as to rejoice in the midst of sorrow. As, however, our minds are easily dispirited, until they give way to impatience, we must observe the remedy that he subjoins immediately afterwards. For on being cast down and laid low we are raised up again by prayers, because we lay upon God what burdened us. As, however, there are every day, nay, every moment, many things that may disturb our peace, and mar our joy, he for this reason bids us <em>pray without ceasing</em>. Now, as to this constancy in prayer, we have spoken of elsewhere. <span class="cite-ref">(610)</span><em>Thanksgiving</em>, as I have said, is added as a limitation. For many pray in such a manner, as at the same time to murmur against God, and fret themselves if he does not immediately gratify their wishes. But, on the contrary, it is befitting that our desires should be restrained in such a manner that, contented with what is given us, we always mingle thanksgiving with our desires. We may lawfully, it is true, ask, nay, sigh and lament, but it must be in such a way that the will of God is more acceptable to us than our own. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(609)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">N’est point en nous, ou pour mieux dire, nous en sommes hors</span>;” — “Is not in us, or as we may rather say, we are away from it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(610)</span> Our author probably refers here to what he has said on this subject when commenting on <span class="bvs">Eph_6:18</span>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
