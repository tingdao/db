He likewise adds, that it was the design of God to hallow, in all ages, the remembrance of so great goodness. This exhibits still more strongly the hateful character of those by whom the free calling of the Gentiles was attacked; for they were endeavoring instantly to crush that scheme which was destined to be remembered through all ages. But we, too, are instructed by it, that the mercy of God, who was pleased to admit our fathers into the number of his own people, deserves to be held in everlasting remembrance. The calling of the Gentiles is an astonishing work of divine goodness, which ought to be handed down by parents to children, and to their children’s children, that it may never be forgotten or unacknowledged by the sons of men. </p><p><em>The riches of his grace in his kindness. </em>The love of God to us in Christ is here proved, or again declared, to have had its origin in mercy<em>. That he might shew, </em>says he, <em>the exceeding riches of his grace. </em>How? <em>In his kindness towards us, </em>as the tree is known by its fruit. Not only, therefore, does he declare, that the love of God was free, but likewise that God displayed in it the riches, — the extraordinary pre-eminent riches of his grace. It deserves notice, also, that the name of<em>Christ </em>is repeated; for no grace, no love, must be expected by us from God, except through his mediation. </p></div>
