<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Not they who are in health need a physician </em>It is evident from Christ’s reply that the scribes erred in two ways: they did not take into account the office of Christ; and, while they spared their own vices, they proudly despised all others. This deserves our particular attention, for it is a disease which has been always very general. Hypocrites, being satisfied and intoxicated with a foolish confidence in their own righteousness, do not consider the purpose for which Christ was sent into the world, and do not acknowledge the depth of evils in which the human race is plunged, or the dreadful wrath and curse of God which lies on all, or the accumulated load of vices which weighs them down. </p><p>The consequence is, that they are too stupid to feel the miseries of men, or to think of a remedy. While they flatter themselves, they cannot endure to be placed in their own rank, and think that injustice is done them, when they are classed with transgressors. Our Lord glances at this second error by replying, that <em>they who are in health have no need of a physician </em>It is an ironical admission, <span class="cite-ref">(520)</span> and is intended to show that they are offended when they see sinners, because they claim righteousness for themselves. Because you are <em>in health, </em>(he says,) you despise <em>the sick, </em>are offended at them, and cannot endure the sight of them: but a <em>physician </em>ought to be affected in a very different manner. He afterwards points out that he must discharge the duties of a <em>physician, </em>because he has been sent by the Father <em>to call sinners </em></p><p>Though Christ begins with reproof, yet if we desire to make progress in his doctrine, what he has put in the second place must receive our first consideration. He came to quicken the dead, to justify the guilty and condemned, to wash those who were polluted and full of uncleanness, to rescue the lost from hell, to clothe with his glory those who were covered with shame, to renew to a blessed immortality those who were debased by disgusting vices. If we consider that this was his office and the end of his coming, — if we remember that this was the reason why he took upon him our flesh, why he shed his blood, why he offered the sacrifice of his death, why he descended even to hell, we will never think it strange that he should gather to salvation those who have been the worst of men, and who have been covered with a mass of crimes. </p><p>He whom you detest appears to you to be unworthy of the grace of Christ. Why then was Christ himself made a sacrifice and a curse, but that he might stretch out his hand to accursed sinners? Now, if we feel disgust at being associated by Baptism and the Lord’s Supper with vile men, and regard our connection with them as a sort of stain upon us, we ought immediately to descend into ourselves, and to search without flattery our own evils. Such an examination will make us willingly allow ourselves to be washed in the same fountain with the most impure, and will hinder us from rejecting the righteousness which he offers indiscriminately to all the ungodly, the life which he offers to the dead, and the salvation which he offers to the lost. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(520)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est une concession par ironie, (c’est a dire, moquerie</span>;”)—”it is an admission made in irony, (that is, in ridicule.”) </p></div></div>
