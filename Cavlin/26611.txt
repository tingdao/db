<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Now is the judgment of this world. </em>The Lord now, as if he had already succeeded in the contest, boasts of having obtained a victory not only over fear, but over death; for he describes, in lofty terms, the advantage of his death, which might have struck his disciples with consternation. Some view the word, <em>judgment </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">πρίσις</span>) as denoting <em>reformation</em>, and others, as denoting <em>condemnation</em>. I rather agree with the former who explain it to mean, that <em>the world </em>must be restored to a proper order; for the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">משפט</span>, <em>mishpat</em>, which is translated <em>judgment</em>, means a well-ordered state. Now we know, that out of Christ there is nothing but confusion in <em>the world</em>; and though Christ had already begun to erect the kingdom of God, yet his death was the commencement of a well-regulated condition, and the full restoration of the world. </p><p>Yet it must also be observed, that this proper arrangement cannot be established in <em>the world</em>, until the kingdom of Satan be first destroyed, until the flesh, and every thing opposed to the righteousness of God, be reduced to nothing. Lastly, the renovation of <em>the world </em>must be preceded by mortification. Accordingly, Christ declares: </p><p><em>Now shall the prince of this world be cast out; </em>for the confusion and deformity arise from this, that while Satan usurps tyrannical dominion, iniquity everywhere abounds. When Satan has been<em>cast out</em>, therefore, <em>the world </em>is brought back from its revolt, and placed under obedience to the government of God. It may be asked, how was Satan <em>cast out </em>by the death of Christ, since he does not cease to make war continually? I reply, this <em>casting out </em>must not be limited to any short period of time, but is a description of that remarkable effect of the death of Christ which is daily manifested. </p></div>
