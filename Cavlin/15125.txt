Truly it was stupidity more than brutish, or rather, as it were, a monstrous thing, <span class="cite-ref">(321)</span> for the Israelites to depart from God, to whom they were under so many and strong obligations. Nor would it have been possible for them to have been so bewitched by Satan, had they not quite forgotten the many miracles wrought in their behalf, which formed so many bonds to keep them in the fear of God and in obedience to him. That no excuse might be left for extenuating their guilt, the prophet ennobles those works by applying to them the term <em>wonderful, </em>thereby intimating, that God’s manner of acting was not of a common kind, so as easily to account for their gradually forgetting his works, but that the Israelites had perversely and wickedly shut their eyes, that they might not be restrained in their sinful course, by beholding the glory of God. </p><p><strong>(321)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A la verite une telle stupidite estoit plusque brutale, ou plustost comme une chose monstrueuse</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
