<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And the fortress. </em>The Prophet now directs his discourse to the country of Moab. It was highly fortified, and was proud of its walls and fortifications; and he affirms that the lofty towers, and other defences, however strong and seemingly impregnable, will be of no avail. The ancients, it is well known, had quite a different method of fortifying from what is practiced among us. </p><p><em>He will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground. </em>The three words here employed, for conveying the meaning more strongly, are not superfluous; for it was necessary to beat down that pride which swelled the hearts of the Moabites, and which, as we formerly saw, <span class="cite-ref">(153)</span> made them intolerable. The Prophet therefore mocks at them, “As if the Lord could not cast down that loftiness of which you boast!” </p><p><em>To the dust. </em>The meaning of this clause is as if he had said, “He will not only level it with the ground, but will reduce it <em>to dust</em>, so that there will not even be a trace of the ancient ruin.” This passage contains an excellent and highly seasonable consolation; for the enemies of the Church in the present day are so haughty, that they mock not only at men, but at God himself, and are so much swelled and puffed up by their power, that they imagine themselves to be invincible; but, in opposition to their bulwarks and defences, we ought to bring forward this declaration of the Prophet, “The Lord will quickly bring down and lay them low.” Yet we must patiently endure to see them strong and powerful, till the full time for their destruction arrive. </p><p><strong>(153)</strong> Bogus footnote </p></div>
