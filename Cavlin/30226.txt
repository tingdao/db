<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Follow peace, etc. </em>Men are so born that they all seem to shun peace; for all study their own interest, seek their own ways, and care not to accommodate themselves to the ways of others. Unless then we strenuously labor to follow peace, we shall never retain it; for many things will happen daily affording occasion for discords. This is the reason why the Apostle bids us to <em>follow </em>peace, as though he had said, that it ought not only to be cultivated as far as it may be convenient to us, but that we ought to strive with all care to keep it among us. And this cannot be done unless we forget many offenses and exercise mutual forbearance. <span class="cite-ref">(255)</span></p><p>As however peace cannot be maintained with the ungodly except on the condition of approving of their vices and wickedness, the Apostle immediately adds, that <em>holiness </em>is to be followed together with peace; as though he commended peace to us with this exception, that the friendship of the wicked is not to be allowed to defile or pollute us; for holiness has an especial regard to God. Though then the whole world were roused to a blazing war, yet holiness is not to be forsaken, for it is the bond of our union with God. In short, let us quietly cherish concord with men, but only, according to the proverb, as far as conscience allows. </p><p>He declares, that without holiness <em>no man shall see the Lord; </em>for with no other eyes shall we see God than those which have been renewed after his image. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(255)</span> It has been justly observed that<span class="lang el-gr">διώκω </span> is to follow or pursue one fleeing away from us. It means not only to seek peace but strive to maintain it. <span class="bvs">Psa_34:14</span>, we have pursuing after seeking, “Seek peace and pursue it,” i.e., strive earnestly to secure and retain it. <span class="bvs">Rom_12:18</span>, is an explanation. </p><p>But this strenuous effort as to peace is to be extended to holiness; not chastity, as Chrysostom and some other fathers have imagined, but holiness in its widest sense, purity of heart and life, universal holiness. The word<span class="lang el-gr">ἁγιασμὸς </span> is indeed taken in a limited sense, and rendered “sanctification” <span class="bvs">1Th_4:3</span>, and it may be so rendered here as it is in those places where it evidently means holiness universally, <span class="bvs">1Co_1:30</span>; <span class="bvs">2Th_2:13</span>, <span class="bvs">1Pe_1:2</span>. The article is put before it in order to show its connection with what follows, “and the (or that) holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
