<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Better is the little of the righteous, etc </em>This verse, without any sufficient reason, has been variously rendered. The word <span class="lang he-il">המון</span><em>, hamon, </em><span class="cite-ref">(32)</span> which is rendered <em>abundance, </em>indeed, sometimes signifies a great multitude of men, and sometimes abundance of things; sometimes, too, an adjective of the plural number is joined to a substantive of the singular number. But those who wrest David’s words to this sense, that a few righteous persons are better than a great multitude of the ungodly, <span class="cite-ref">(33)</span> plainly destroy their import, and pervert the meaning of the whole sentence. Nor can I receive the explanation which others have given, that the little which the just man possesses is better than the great abundance of the wicked; for I see no necessity for connecting, contrary to the rules of grammar, the word <span class="lang he-il">המון</span>,<em>hamon, </em>which denotes <em>abundance, </em>with the word <span class="lang he-il">רבים</span>, <em>rabbim. </em>which signifies <em>many </em>or <em>great, </em>and not with the word <span class="lang he-il">רשעים</span>, <em>reshaim, </em>which means <em>wicked </em>I have therefore no doubt; that David here contrasts the limited possessions of one righteous man with the riches and wealth of many wicked men. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">רבים</span>, <em>rabbim, </em>however, which I have rendered <em>many, </em>may also be properly taken to denote persons of great authority and power. Certainly, it is not difficult to understand that David means to say, that although the wicked excel in this world, and are enriched with its possessions in great abundance and trust in their riches, yet the little which the just man possesses is far better than all their treasures. From this we learn, that David is here speaking, not so much of external grandeur and wealth, as of the secret blessing of God which truly enriches the righteous; for although they live from hand to mouth, yet are they fed from heaven as it were with manna; while the ungodly are always hungry, or else waste away in the very midst of their abundance. </p><p>To this also belongs the reason which is added in the next verse, namely, that there is nothing stable in the world except it be sustained by the power of God; but we are plainly told that <em>the righteous </em>only are <em>upheld by him, </em>and that <em>the power of the ungodly shall be broken </em>Here again we see, that in order to form a right and proper estimate of true felicity, we must look forward to the future, or contemplate by the eye of faith the secret grace of God, and his hidden judgments. Unless we are persuaded by faith that God cherishes us in his bosom as a father does his children, our poverty will always be a source of trouble to us; and, on the other hand, unless we bear in mind what is here said concerning the wicked, that <em>their arms shall be broken, </em>we will make too great account of their present condition. But if this doctrine be deeply fixed in the hearts of the faithful, as soon as they shall have learned to rely upon the divine blessing, the delight and joy which they will experience from their little store shall be equal to the magnanimity with which they shall look down, as it were from an eminence, upon the vast treasures in which the ungodly glory. At the same time, we are here admonished, that whilst the ungodly rely upon their own strength, and proudly boast of it, we ought to wait patiently till God arise and break their arms in pieces. As for us, the best consolation which we could have in our infirmity is, that God himself upholds and strengthens us. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(32)</span> Ainsworth renders this word, “plenteous mammon,” which, he remarks, “signifieth multitude, plenty, or store of riches, or any other thing.” The Septuagint renders it <em>riches</em>. The English word <em>mammon </em>is derived from this Hebrew word. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(33)</span> This is the view taken by Fry, who renders the words, </p><p>  </p><p>“Better are the few of the Just one,<LineBreak />Than the great multitude of the wicked.” </p><p>By the Just One, he understands Christ. </p></div></div>
