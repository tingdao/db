<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>He will cut off </em><span class="cite-ref">(285)</span><em>the spirit of princes. </em>As the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">בצר</span>, <em>batsar, </em>occasionally signifies <em>to strengthen, </em>some think it should be so translated in this passage. But as in the two clauses of the verse the same sentiment is repeated, I have no doubt that by the first clause is meant that understanding and wisdom are taken away from princes; and that by the second, God is represented in general as terrible to them, because he will cast them down headlong from their loftiness. As the first thing necessary to conduct an enterprise to a prosperous issue is to possess sound foresight, in which the people of God are often deficient from the great perplexity in which they are involved in the midst of their distresses, while, on the other hand, the ungodly are too sharp-sighted in their crafty schemes; it is here declared that it is in the power of God to deprive of understanding, and to inflict blindness on those who seem to surpass others in acuteness and ingenuity. The majority of princes being enemies to the Church of God, it is expressly affirmed, that He is sufficiently terrible to subdue all the kings of the earth. When it is said, that <em>their spirit is cut off, </em>or taken away from them, it is to be limited to tyrants and robbers whom God infatuates, because he sees that they apply all their ingenuity and counsels to do mischief. </p><p><strong>(285)</strong> The word employed by Calvin is “Vindemiabit,” which expresses the precise idea of the original verb, <span class="lang he-il">יבצור</span>, <em>yebtstor </em>It is from <span class="lang he-il">בצר</span>, <em>he cut off</em>, <em>brake off</em>, referring properly to grapes and other fruits. The reading of the LXX. is, “takes away.” </p></div>
