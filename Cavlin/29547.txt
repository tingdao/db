<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Walk wisely. </em>He makes mention of <em>those that are without</em>, in contrast with those that are of the <em>household of faith</em>. (<span class="bvs">Gal_6:10</span>.) For the Church is like a city of which all believers are the inhabitants, connected with each other by a mutual relationship, while unbelievers are strangers. But why would he have regard to be had to them, rather than to believers? There are three reasons: <em>first</em>, </p><p>lest any <em>stumblingblock be put in</em>, <LineBreak /><em>the way of the blind</em>, (<span class="bvs">Lev_19:14</span>,) </p><p>for nothing is more ready to occur, than that unbelievers are driven from bad to worse through our imprudence, and their minds are wounded, so that they hold religion more and more in abhorrence. <em>Secondly</em>, it is lest any occasion may be given for detracting from the honor of the gospel, and thus the name of Christ be exposed to derision, persons be rendered more hostile, and disturbances and persecutions be stirred up. <em>Lastly</em>, it is, lest, while we are mingled together, in partaking of food, and on other occasions, we be defiled by their pollutions, and by little and little become profane. </p><p>To the same effect, also, is what follows, <em>redeeming the time</em>, that is, because intercourse with them is dangerous. For in <span class="bvs">Eph_5:16</span>, he assigns the reason, <em>because the days are evil</em>. “Amidst so great a corruption as prevails in the world we must seize opportunities of doing good, and we must struggle against impediments.” The more, therefore, that our path is blocked up with occasions of offense, so much the more carefully must we take heed lest our feet should stumble, or we should stop short through indolence. </p></div>
