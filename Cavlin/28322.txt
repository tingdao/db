<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>So that from Jerusalem, etc. </em>He joins also a testimony from the effect; for the success which followed his preaching exceeded all the thoughts of men. For who could have gathered so many churches for Christ, without being aided by the power of God? “FromJerusalem,” he says, “I have propagated the gospel as far as Illyricum, and not by hastening to the end of my course by a straight way, but by going all around, and through the intervening countries.” But the verb <span class="lang el-gr">πεπληρωκέναι</span><em>, </em>which after others I have rendered <em>filled up </em>or completed, means both to perfect and to supply what is wanting. Hence <span class="lang el-gr">πλήρωμα</span> in Greek means perfection as well as a supplement. I am disposed to explain it thus, — that he diffused, as it were by filling up, the preaching of the gospel; for others had before begun, but he spread it wider. <span class="cite-ref">(455)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(455)</span> The clause is rendered by [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>], “Impleverim praedicandi evangelii Christi munus — I have fulfilled the office of preaching the gospel of Christ.” The gospel is put for preaching the gospel. See <span class="bvs">Act_12:25</span>; <span class="bvs">Col_1:25</span> [<span class="bvs">Vatablus </span>] renders the verb “plene annunciaverim — I have fully announced;” and [<span class="bvs">Mede </span>], “propagaverim — I have propagated.” Some, as [<span class="bvs">Wolfius </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Vitringa </span>], think the verb is used in a sense borrowed from Hebrew: the verb <span class="lang he-il">גמר</span>, which in its common meaning is to <em>fill </em>or to finish, is used in the sense of teaching, not indeed in the Hebrew bible, but in the Talmud. That the idea of teaching, or propagating, or preaching, belongs to it here, and in <span class="bvs">Col_1:25</span>, is evident. The notion of filling up, which [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] gives to it, is hardly consistent with what the Apostle says in <span class="bvs">Rom_15:20</span>. The <em>full </em>preaching is referred by [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>], not to its extent, but to its fidelity, “omitting nothing which a faithful evangelist ought to have proclaimed.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
