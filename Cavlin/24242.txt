<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_1:26</span><em>When the unclean spirit had torn him </em>Luke uses a milder phrase, <em>when the devil had thrown him down: </em>but they agree perfectly as to the meaning; for the design of both was to show, that the devil went out of the man in a violent manner. He threw down the unhappy man, as if he had intended to tear him: but Luke says that the attempt was unsuccessful; for <em>he hurt him nothing </em>Not that the attack was, in no degree whatever, attended by injury, or at least by some feeling of pain; but that the man was afterwards delivered from the devil, and restored to perfect health. </p></div>
