<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_5:15</span><strong>.</strong><em>And they come to Jesus </em>We have here a striking proof that not all who perceive the hand of God profit as they ought to do by yielding themselves to him in sincere godliness. Having seen the miracle, the Gadarenes were afraid, because the majesty of God shone brightly in Christ. So far they did right but now that they send him out of their territories, what could have been done worse than this? They too were scattered, and here is a shepherd to collect them or rather, it is God who stretches out his arms, through his Son, to embrace and carry to heaven those who were overwhelmed by the darkness of death. They choose rather to be deprived of the salvation which is offered to them, than to endure any longer the presence of Christ. </p><p>The apparent ground of their offense is the loss of the swine, but Luke assigns a loftier cause, that they were <em>seized with a great fear</em>; <span class="cite-ref">(556)</span> and certainly, if they had been exasperated by the loss which they sustained, they would not have <em>requested </em>him, but would rudely have driven him out. They honor him as God’s minister, and yet are so struck with dread as to desire that he will go to a distance from them. Thus we see that they were not at all moved by a sense of the divine grace. And indeed, though all wicked men adore God, and bestow great pains on appeasing him, yet if they had their choice, they would withdraw to the greatest possible distance from him: for his face is terrible, so long as they contemplate him as a Judge, and not as a Father. The consequence is, that the gospel, which is more delightful than any thing that can be conceived, is everywhere considered to be so dismal and severe, that a good part of the world would wish that it were buried. </p><p>And yet it is true that their fear was partly occasioned by their loss. Thus at the present day, so long as men believe that the kingdom of God is opposed to their interest, either of a public or private nature, they are prepossessed by a depraved and carnal fear, and have no relish for his grace. Accordingly, when he comes, they think that God does not regard them with favor, but rather with anger, and, so far as lies in their power, they send him to another place. It is a mark of shameful insensibility in those men, that the loss of their swine gives them more alarm than the salvation of their soul would give them joy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(556)</span><span class="lang el-gr">“ ᾿Εφοβήθησαν, </span><em>they were afraid, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mar_5:15</span>,) is by most Commentators understood of <em>fear </em>lest they might suffer a yet greater calamity; but it rather denotes awe at the stupendous <em>miracle</em>. ” —<em>Bloomfield </em></p></div></div>
