<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>On account of all these things. </em>The rendering that has been given by others, “<em>super </em>omnia haec,” (<em>above </em>all these things,) instead of <em>insuper </em>, (<em>over and above</em>,) is, in my opinion, meagre. It would be more suitable to render it, <em>Before </em>all these things. I have chosen, however, the more ordinary signification of the word <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπί</span>. For as all the things that he has hitherto enumerated flow from <em>love</em>, he now on good grounds exhorts the Colossians to cherish <em>love </em>among themselves, for the sake of these things — that they may be merciful, gentle, ready to forgive, as though he had said, that they would be such only in the event of their having <em>love</em>. For where <em>love </em>is wanting, all these things are sought for in vain. That he may commend it the more, he calls it the <em>bond of perfection</em>, meaning by this, that the troop of all the virtues <span class="cite-ref">(444)</span> is comprehended under it. For this truly is the rule of our whole life, and of all our actions, so that everything that is not regulated according to it is faulty, whatever attractiveness it may otherwise possess. This is the reason why it is called here the <em>bond of perfection</em>; because there is nothing in our life that is well regulated if it be not directed towards it, but everything that we attempt is mere waste. </p><p>The Papists, however, act a ridiculous part in abusing this declaration, with the view of maintaining justification by works. “<em>Love</em>, ” say they, “is the <em>bond of perfection</em>: now perfection is righteousness; therefore we are justified by <em>love</em>. ” The answer is twofold; for Paul here is not reasoning as to the manner in which men are made perfect in the sight of God, but as to the manner in which they may live perfectly among themselves. For the genuine exposition of the passage is this — that other things will be in a desirable state as to our life, if <em>love </em>be exercised among us. When, however, we grant that <em>love </em>is righteousness, they groundlessly and childishly take occasion from this to maintain, that we are justified by <em>love</em>, for where will perfect love be found? We, however, do not say that men are justified by faith alone, on the ground that the observance of the law is not righteousness, but rather on this ground, that as we are all transgressors of the law, we are, in consequence of our being destitute of any righteousness of our own, constrained to borrow righteousness from Christ. There remains nothing, therefore, but the righteousness of faith, because perfect love is nowhere to be found. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(444)</span>Virtutum omnium chorum.
