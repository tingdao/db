<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17</strong><em>My strength is with thee, I will sing psalms </em>He expresses still more explicitly the truth, that he owed his safety entirely to God. Formerly he had said that the strength of his enemy was with God, and now he asserts the same thing of his own. The expression, however, which admits of two meanings, he elegantly applies to himself in a different sense. <span class="cite-ref">(376)</span> God has the strength of the wicked in his hands, to curb and to restrain it, and to show that any power of which they boast is vain and fallacious. His own people, on the other hand, he supports and secures, against the possibility of falling, by supplies of strength from himself. In the preceding part of the psalm, David had congratulated himself upon his safety, by reflecting that Saul was so completely under the secret restraint of God’s providence as to be unable to move a finger without his permission. Now, weak as he was in himself, he maintains that he had strength sufficient in the Lord; and accordingly adds, that he had good reason to engage in praise, as James the inspired apostle exhorts those who are merry to sing psalms, (<span class="bvs">Jas_5:13</span>.) As to the reading which some have adopted, <em>I will ascribe my strength with praises unto thee, </em>the reader cannot fail to see that it is forced. It is clear that the two clauses must be taken separately, as I have already observed. </p><p><strong>(376)</strong> “Sed eleganter ambiguam locutionem diverso sensu ponit.” —<em>Lat</em>. In the French version, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais c’est une bonne rencontre et qui a grace, quand il met deux fois un propos ambigu, mais en divers sens</span>.” </p></div>
