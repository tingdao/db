<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>To the married I command. </em>He now treats of another condition of marriage — its being an indissoluble tie. Accordingly, he condemns all those divorces that were of daily occurrence among the heathens, and were not punished among the Jews by the law of Moses. <em>Let not, </em>says he, <em>the husband put away his wife, and let not the wife depart from her husband. </em>Why? Because they are joined together by an indissoluble bond. It is surprising, however, that he does not make an exception, at least in case of adultery; for it is not likely that he designed to curtail in anything the doctrine of Christ. To me it appears clear, that the reason why he has made no mention of this <span class="cite-ref">(399)</span> is, that as he is discoursing of these things only in passing, he chose rather to send back the Corinthians to the Lord’s permission or prohibition, than to go over everything in detail. For when persons intend to teach anything in short compass, they content themselves with a general statement. Exceptions are reserved for a minuter and more extended and particular discussion. </p><p>But as to what he subjoins — <em>not I, but the Lord </em>— he intimates by this correction, that what he teaches here is taken from the law of God. For other things that he taught he had also from the revelation of the Spirit; but he declares that God is the author of this, in respect of its being expressly taken from the law of God. If you inquire as to the particular passage, you will nowhere find it in so many words; but as Moses in the beginning testifies, that the connection between a husband and wife is so sacred, that for the sake of it </p><p>a man ought to leave his father and mother. (<span class="bvs">Gen_2:24</span>.) </p><p>It is easy to gather from this, how inviolable a connection it is. For by right of nature a son is bound to his father and mother, and cannot shake off that yoke. As the connection of marriage is preferred to that bond, much less ought <em>it </em>to be dissolved. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(399)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’a pas voulu toucher ce poinct</span>;” — “He has not chosen to touch upon this point.” </p></div></div>
