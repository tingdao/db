<div class="comment-content"><p>Observe, however, that he says that he <em>had been in want, </em>for he would never have been a burden to them, had he not been constrained by necessity. He, nevertheless, in the mean time, <em>labored with his hands, </em>as we have seen before, (<span class="bvs">1Co_4:12</span>,) but, as the <em>labor of his hands </em>was not sufficient for sustaining life, something additional was contributed by the Macedonians. Accordingly he does not say, that his living had been furnished to him by the Macedonians, <span class="cite-ref">(826)</span> but merely that they had supplied what was wanting. We have spoken elsewhere of the Apostle’s holy prudence and diligence in providing against dangers. Here we must take notice of the pious zeal of the Macedonians, who did not hesitate to contribute of their substance for his pay, that the gospel might be proclaimed to others, and those, too, that were wealthier than themselves. Ah! how few <em>Macedonians </em>are there in the present day, and on the other hand how many <em>Corinthians </em>you may find everywhere! </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(826)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ne dit pas que les Macedoniens luy eussent donne tout ce qui luy estoit necessaire</span>;” — “He does not say that the Macedonians had given him every thing that was necessary.” </p></div></div>
