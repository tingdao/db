<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_5:43</span><strong>.</strong><em>Thou shalt love thy neighbor. </em>It is astonishing, that the Scribes fell into so great an absurdity, as to limit the word <em>neighbor </em>to benevolent persons: for nothing is more obvious or certain than that God, in speaking of our neighbors, includes the whole human race. Every man is devoted to himself; and whenever a regard to personal convenience occasions an interruption of acts of kindness, there is a departure from that mutual intercourse, which nature itself dictates. To keep up the exercise of brotherly love, God assures us, that all men are our brethren, because they are related to us by a common nature. Whenever I see a man, I must, of necessity, behold myself as in a mirror: for he is my <em>bone and my flesh, </em>(<span class="bvs">Gen_29:14</span>.) Now, though the greater part of men break off, in most instances, from this holy society, yet their depravity does not violate the order of nature; for we ought to regard God as the author of the union. </p><p>Hence we conclude, that the precept of the law, by which we are commanded to love our neighbor, is general. But the Scribes, judging of <em>neighborhood </em>from the disposition of the individual, affirmed that no man ought to be reckoned a <em>neighbor, </em>unless he were worthy of esteem on account of his own excellencies, or, at least, unless he acted the part of a friend. This is, no doubt, supported by the common opinion; and therefore the children of the world are not ashamed to acknowledge their resentments, when they have any reason to assign for them. But the charity, which God requires in his law, looks not at what a man has deserved, but extends itself to the unworthy, the wicked, and the ungrateful. Now, this is the true meaning which Christ restores, and vindicates from calumny; and hence it is obvious, as I have already said, that Christ does not introduce new laws, but corrects the wicked glosses of the Scribes, by whom the purity of the divine law had been corrupted. </p></div>
