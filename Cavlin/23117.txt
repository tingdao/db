<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet amplifies again the fault of the priests, because the people, when they perceived that God was adverse to them, found no means of pacifying him. And when men have an idea that God is inexorable to them, every zeal for religion must necessarily decay; and hence it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_130:4</span> — “With thee is propitiation, that thou mayest be feared.” As the people then gained nothing by sacrificing, they had now nearly fallen off from divine worship. This evil, a most grievous one, the Prophet says, was to be justly ascribed to the priests; for as they were become polluted, how could their persons have been accepted by God, that they might be mediators to expiate sins and to pacify God? </p><p>This is the real meaning of the Prophet, which none of the interpreters have perceived. The Rabbins think that the priests are here reproved, because their wives filled the altar in the sanctuary with weeping, because they saw that their husbands did not faithfully treat them, according to the law of marriage; and almost all have agreed with them. Thus then they explain the verse — <em>Ye have in the second place done this</em>; that is, “That sin was of itself sufficiently grievous, when ye suffered lean victims to be sacrificed to me, as it were in mockery; but in addition to this comes your sin against your wives, who continually complain and deplore their condition before the altar of God, even because they are not loved by you, as the right of marriage requires.” They thus refer the tears, the weeping, and lamentation, to the wives of the priests, which were so cruelly treated by their husbands: they were not able to do anything else than to fill God’s sanctuary with their constant complaints. Hence they render, <span class="lang he-il">מאין עוד פנות</span>, <em>main oud penut</em>, “I will not therefore regard,” or, “no one regards;” but both versions are not only obscure, but wholly pervert the sense of the Prophet. </p><p>But what I have already stated is the most suitable — that it was to be ascribed to the priests that no one could from the heart worship God, at least with a cheerful and willing mind; for God was implacable to the people, because the only way of obtaining favor under the law was when the priests, who represented the Mediator, humbly entreated pardon in the name of the whole people. But how could God attend to the prayers of the priests when they had polluted his altar by the filth of wickedness? We then see the object of this amplification — <em>Ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping and wailing</em>. The praises of God ought to have resounded in the temple, according to what is said — </p><p>“Praise, O God, waits for thee in Zion.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_65:1</span>.) </p><p>And the principal sacrifice was, that the people exercised themselves in contemplating the blessings of God, and in thanksgiving. But he says that none went forth before the altar with a cheerful mind, but all were sad and sorrowful, because they found that God was severe and rigid. </p><p>And the reason is added — <span class="lang he-il">מאין עוד פנות</span>, <em>main oud penut</em>, literally, “Is it not any more by regarding,” etc.? It is easy to see how far they depart from the meaning of the Prophet who read — “They shall therefore offer no more;” for is this to be applied to God? Others also, who give this rendering — “I shall not therefore accept,” pervert also the very letter of the text. But the most appropriate meaning is this — that all wept and groaned before the altar, because they saw that they came there without any advantage, that their sacrifices did not please God, and that the whole worship was in vain, inasmuch as God did not answer their prayers. The Prophet ascribes the fault to the priests, that God did not turn to mercy, so as to forgive the people when they sacrificed. With weeping, then, he says, was the altar filled or covered, because God received not <em>what pleased him from their hand</em>; that is, because no victims pleased him which were offered by polluted and impure hands. <span class="cite-ref">(231)</span> He afterwards joins </p><p><strong>(231)</strong> It is not easy to give a version of this verse. <em>Henderson </em>renders the first line thus — </p><p>And this ye have done the second time. </p><p>The reference is, he says, to the repetition of the evil which had been corrected under <span class="bvs">Ezr_9:0</span> and 10. This seems probable; but we may view this “second,” or again, with regard to the previous denunciations. What are regarded as verbs in the infinitive mood are in my view participial nouns; the last, <span class="lang he-il">לקחת</span>, is evidently so. Then the literal rendering would be this— </p><p>And this again ye do — Covering with tears the altar, Weeping and groaning, Because<em>there </em>is no more turning to the offering, Or the receiving of what is acceptable from your hand. </p><p>That <span class="lang he-il">מאין</span> is to be rendered “because not,” or, “inasmuch as not,” is evident from other places. See <span class="bvs">Jer_10:6</span>. “Turning” signifies having a regard to. “What is acceptable,” <span class="lang he-il">רצון</span>, is rendered “<span class="lang el-gr">δεκτον </span> — acceptable,” in the <em>Septuagint</em>; “<span class="lang el-gr">ἑυδοκίαν</span> —good-will,” by <em>Aq.; </em>“<span class="lang el-gr">τὸ ευδοκημένον </span> — what is approved,” by <em>Sym</em>. ; “<span class="lang el-gr">τέλαιον </span> — perfect,” by <em>Theodoret </em></p><p>The difference between <em>Calvin </em>and most expositors after him, as well as before him, is, that he regarded the lamentation to have been by the priests and people, and they by the repudiated wives. The cause of the weeping, as stated here, was the rejection of the offerings, as declared by the Prophet; and this seems enough to confirm <em>Calvin’s </em>view. </p><p>The priests and people had been denounced for their wickedness, especially for marrying strange wives. After this denunciation they “again” went to the altar and wept because God would not receive their sacrifices; and they did this without amending their ways. Then in the next verse the Prophet explains why God would not receive their offerings. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
