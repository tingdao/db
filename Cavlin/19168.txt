<div class="comment-content"><p>This verse, and those which follow, are explained in different ways; but I will briefly shew the meaning of the Prophet. I have no doubt but that he speaks here in the name of the whole people. The Prophet, then, in these words, represents what occupied their minds, and the counsels which the Jews adopted: and further, there is no doubt but that he shews in these words that they, as hypocrites are wont to do, had recourse to expedients, by which they thought they could protect themselves from God’s wrath. For they who think that the Prophet spoke his own sentiments are greatly mistaken: on the contrary, he relates here the purposes which the Jews formed; and at the same time he reproves their hardness in turning here and there, and in thinking that they could turn aside the judgment of God; for hypocrites, unless constrained, never ascend to the first cause; that is, they never acknowledge nor regard the hand of him who strikes them, as it is said in another place. (<span class="bvs">Isa_9:13</span>.) They indeed feel their evils, and seek to apply remedies; but they stop at the nearest reliefs, without seeking to pacify God and to return into favor with him; and when the smallest hope is given them, they think themselves to be safe, if they betake themselves to this or that hiding-place. </p><p>This feeling is what the Prophet describes: <em>Why do we sit? </em>or, “Why do we rest?” But the word here means to sit still: <em>Why do we </em>then <em>sit still? </em>as though they had accused themselves of sloth or idleness: “What means this our slothfulness? we sit still in the villages, which are exposed to the violence of enemies: <em>gather </em>then yourselves, and let us <em>enter </em>into fortified cities; we shall rest there.” They thought that they should be safe, if they entered into fortified cities. Then, on the other hand, Jeremiah shews how foolishly they trusted to such refuges. <em>Surely, </em>he says<em>, our God hath made us silent </em>He had said before <span class="lang he-il">ונדמה-שם</span><em>, vanudame-shem, “ </em>and we shall there rest.” The verb<em>, </em>means to rest, and to be silent. He repeats the same word, “<em>Surely, </em>our God hath made us to be silent;” but in a different sense. There is then a striking allusion in the verb <span class="lang he-il">דמה</span>, <em>dame</em>, or the sameness of sound. “Jehovah hath made us to be silent, “or to rest; or, he hath cut us off, for in Hiphil, it has this meaning. <span class="cite-ref">(228)</span></p><p>We hence see, that on the one hand is declared what might have given some comfort to the Jews, for there were fortified cities which might have protected them from the assaults of enemies; but, on the other hand, the Prophet shews that they were greatly mistaken, for God would make them to rest in a different manner, as he would reduce them to nothing; for the dead are said to rest, or to be silent. In short, he means a quiet state when speaking in the name of the people; but he refers to destruction when speaking by God’s command. </p><p>He afterwards confirms the same thing in a metaphorical language, <em>God will give them the waters of gall, </em>or, poisoned waters: and he adds, <em>Because they have acted impiously against Jehovah </em>We may learn from this last part, that the Prophet is now performing the duty of his office. The people indeed never willingly allowed that they were suffering punishment justly due to their sins; but the Prophet here reproves them for hoping to be safe by fleeing to fortified cities, as though God could not follow them there. He then says that God’s vengeance would closely pursue them, and that wherever they fled, they would still be exposed to evils, for they carried with them their impieties, which would draw upon them the wrath of God. It follows — </p><p><strong>(228)</strong> The verb <span class="lang he-il">דמה</span> means, to be silent, to be reduced to silence; and the silence is that of inactivity, or of weakness, or of death. The silence of inactivity seems to be the meaning in the first instance, and the silence of weakness in the second: “Let us be silent,“ or, let us rest; “God hath made us silent,“ or, made us feeble, or, reduced to nothing our strength: — </p><p><strong>14.</strong>Why do we sit still? be ye assembled, And let us go into fortified cities, And let us be silent there; For Jehovah our God has reduced us to silence; And he has given us to drink the water of hemlock, Because we have sinned against Jehovah. </p><p>That <span class="lang he-il">ראש</span> is “hemlock,“ or some poisonous herb, is evident from <span class="bvs">Hos_10:4</span>. “The water” seems to be the juice in this instance — “the juice of hemlock.” It is rendered “the water of gall, <span class="lang el-gr">ὕδωρ χολὢς</span>,” by the <em>Septuagint, </em>and the same by the <em>Vulgate; “ </em>bitter waters,“ by the <em>Syriac; “ </em>water of bitterness,“ by the <em>Arabic; “ </em>the cup of malediction,“ by the <em>Targum</em>. “Water of hemlock” is the rendering of <em>Blayney. </em></p><p><em>Horsley </em>renders the third and the fourth line as follows: — </p><p>And let us there sit in despair, Since the Lord our God hath brought us to despair. </p><p>— <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
