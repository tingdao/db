<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_5:20</span><strong>.</strong><em>Unless your righteousness shall be more abundant. He </em>takes a passing notice of <em>the Scribes, </em>who were laboring to throw a stain on the doctrine of the Gospel, as if it were the ruin of the Law. True, he does not reason on this subject, but only points out briefly, that nothing has less influence over their minds than zeal for the law. “They pretend, that their hostility to me arises from their strong desire, that the law should not be violated. But their life makes it evident, how coldly they observe the law, — nay more, how unconcerned they are about mocking God, <span class="cite-ref">(392)</span> while they boast before men of an assumed and hypocritical righteousness.” This is the view which the most of commentators give of the passage. </p><p>But it deserves inquiry, whether he does not rather blame the corrupted manner of teaching, which <em>the Pharisees and Scribes </em>followed in instructing the people. By confining the law of God to outward duties only, they trained their disciples, like apes, to hypocrisy. <span class="cite-ref">(393)</span> They lived, I readily admit, as ill as they taught, and even worse: and therefore, along with their corrupted doctrine, I willingly include their hypocritical parade of false righteousness. The principal charge brought by Christ against their doctrine may be easily learned from what follows in the discourse, where he removes from the law their false and wicked interpretations, and restores it to its purity. In short, the objection which, as we have already said, was unjustly brought against him by the Scribes, is powerfully thrown back on themselves. </p><p>We must bear in mind, what we have mentioned elsewhere, that the Pharisees are added to the Scribes by way of enlarging on what he had said: for that sect had, above all others, obtained a reputation for sanctity. It is a mistake, however, to suppose, that they were called <em>Pharisees </em>on account of <em>division, </em><span class="cite-ref">(394)</span> because they <em>separated </em>themselves from the ordinary class, and claimed a rank peculiar to themselves. They were called <span class="lang he-il">פרושים</span>, that is, <em>Expounders, </em><span class="cite-ref">(395)</span> because they were not satisfied with the bare letter, but boasted of being in possession of a key to open up hidden meanings. Hence arose an immense mass of errors, when they assumed magisterial authority, and ventured, according to their wicked fancy and their equally wicked pride, to thrust forward their own inventions in place of Scripture. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(392)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme ils se moquent de Dieu sans en faire conscience</span>.” — “How they mock God, without making conscience of it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(393)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils accoustumoyent leurs disc p es k ne hypocrisle, et en faisoyent des singes</span>.” — “They accustomed their disciples to a hypocrisy, and made apes of them.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(394)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De division, ou separation</span>;” — “of division, or separation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(395)</span> Among a host of opinions as to the origin of the name <em>Pharisees, </em>there is room to doubt if Calvin has hit upon the true etymology. There are two roots: <span class="lang he-il">פרׂש</span><em>(paras,) to spread out, </em>with <em>Sin </em>for the final letter, — and <span class="lang he-il">פרׁש</span><em>(parash,). to explain, to separate, </em>with <em>Schin. </em>Both have been pressed into the service. The former is chiefly quoted in support of an allusion to our Lord's description of them, that <em>they make broad their phylacteries, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_23:5</span>.) But the latter root has been more fertile in suggestions. <em>John Alberti, </em>no mean authority, in his <em>Glossarium Grcecurn </em><em>, </em>(under <span class="bvs">Luk_11:38</span>,) defines<span class="lang el-gr">Φαρισαῖος, </span> to be <span class="lang el-gr">διακεχωρισμένος, </span><em>separated, </em>and quotes the Septuagint as employing that participle (<span class="bvs">Eze_34:12</span>) for, <span class="lang he-il">נפרׁשות</span> the principhal participle of <span class="lang he-il">פרׁש</span>, <em>(parash.) </em>From <em>Hesychius </em>he gives synonyms of like import<span class="lang el-gr">, — Φαρισαῖος, ἀφωρισμένος, μεμερισμένος, καθαρός </span> As to the last of those terms,<span class="lang el-gr">καθαρός, </span> the learned <em>Vitringa, </em>to whom <em>Alberti </em>also refers, has copiously illustrated its meaning in a passage, which has been often quoted as embodying the proud challenge of the Pharisee, <em>Stand by: for I am holier than thou, </em>(<span class="bvs">Isa_65:5</span><em>) </em>—<em>Suidas </em>unhesitatingly defends the same idea of <em>separation. </em>His definition is as follows<span class="lang el-gr">: Φαρισαῖοι οἱ ἑρμηνευόμενοι ἀφωρισμένοι, παρὰ τὸ μερίζειν καὶ ἀφορίζειν ἑαυτοὺς τῶν ἄλλων ἁπάντων, εἴς τε τὸ καθαρώτατον τοῦ βίου, καὶ ἀκριβέστατον, καὶ εἰς τὰ τοῦ νόμου ἐντάλματα</span><em>. “Pharisees, </em>—<em>which </em>means <em>separated, </em>on account of their <em>dividing </em>and <em>separating </em>themselves from all others, to the greatest purity and strictness of life, and to the prescriptions of the law.” — Calvin's derivation is from the same root, and is certainly ingenious. That sect, we know, boasted of a rigid adherence to the law, though it may be questioned whether profound skill in <em>exposition </em>was claimed by all its members. Many of them might think that this belonged to the Scribes as a professional matter. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
