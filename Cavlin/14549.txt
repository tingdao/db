<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>And if he come to see me, he speaketh lies. </em>What is contained in this verse relates to his false and treacherous friends. Those who were his professed enemies made no secret of their enmity against him, but openly persecuted him; and that he has already shown in the preceding verse. In addition to this, he now complains that many came to him with professions of attachment to him, as if they had been his friends, who, nevertheless, afterwards poured forth their malicious ill-will in secret against him. Enemies of this sort, who thus cover and conceal their malice, and insinuate themselves under the mask of a fair appearance, only for the purpose of secretly doing us mischief, are indeed much more to be feared than those who openly declare their wicked intentions. Accordingly, having complained of his open enemies, he proceeds to speak of his pretended friends, of whom he declares that they come to see him with no other design than <em>to speak lies, </em>and yet that they are meanwhile devising some deceitful and malicious purpose against him, nay, that they are even secretly <em>heaping up iniquity, </em>and, so to speak, laying it up in store in their hearts; and then he adds, that when <em>they have gone forth </em>from his presence, they manifest their hypocrisy and deceitfulness. </p></div>
