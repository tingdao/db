<div class="comment-content"><p>He bids them to <em>attend</em>, or to beware <em>in their souls</em>. Some render the words, “As your souls are precious to you.” But I take souls, not for their lives, but for the affections of their hearts; as though he had said, “Take heed carefully of yourselves, that this may be laid up in your inmost heart.” The word <span class="lang he-il">נפש</span><em>nuphesh</em>, means often the heart, the seat of the affections. It is said in <span class="bvs">Deu_4:15</span>, </p><p>“Take heed to yourselves, <span class="lang he-il">לנפשותיכם</span><em>lanupheshuticam</em>, <LineBreak />to your souls.” </p><p>here it is, <span class="lang he-il">בנפשותיכם</span>, <em>benupheshuticam</em>, “in your souls;” but there, “to” or “for your souls,” as also in <span class="bvs">Jos_23:11</span>. But the same thing is meant, and that is, that they were to take great heed, to take every care, to exert every effort, and, in short, every faculty of their souls. <em>Take heed </em>then <em>carefully</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(187)</span> he says, take heed with every thought and faculty of your soul, <em>that ye carry no burden on the Sabbath-day, and that ye bring it not through the gates of Jerusalem</em>. It was a thing not difficult to be observed; and further, it was a most shameless transgression of the law; for, as I have said, by this slight matter they shewed that they despised the law of God, while yet the observance of the Sabbath was a thing of great importance: it was important in itself, but to observe it was easy. Hence appeared the twofold impiety of the people, — because they despised God’s singular favor, of which the seventh day was an evidence; and, because they were unwilling to take rest on that day, and in so easy a matter, they hesitated not, as it were, to insult God, as it has been before said. </p><p>Hence we ought to notice also what he says in these words, <em>Carry no burden, and bring it not through the gatesof Jerusalem</em>: and this was emphatically added; for it was not lawful even in the fields or in desert places to do anything on the Sabbath; but it was extremely shameful to carry a burden through the gates of Jerusalem; it was as though they wished publicly to reproach and despise God. Jerusalem was a public place; and it was as though one was not content privately to do dishonor to his neighbor or his brother, but must shew his ill-nature openly and in the light of day. Thus the Jews were not only reproachful towards God, but also dared to shew their impiety in his own renowned city, and, in short, in his very sanctuary. The rest we must defer. </p><p><strong>(187)</strong> “Guard ye your souls” is the version of the <em>Septuagint, Vulgate, </em>and the <em>Targum; </em>but that of the <em>Syriac </em>is, “Take heed to yourselves;” which is no doubt the meaning, as the word soul, <span class="lang he-il">נפש</span>, is often used for one’s self. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
