He denominates as the <em>works of men </em>all the false worship which they devise without the Divine sanction; as if he should say, that the holiness, which is truly connected with the worship of God, comes from his word, and that all human inventions and admixtures in religion are profane, and tend to corrupt the service of God. Doubtless it was the intention of the Israelites to serve God, but the Holy Spirit declares that all the fruit of their burning zeal was their becoming more abominable in Godâ€™s sight by their lewd inventions. For a strict adherence to the word of God constitutes spiritual chastity. </p></div>
