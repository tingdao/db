<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Not that I speak with respect to want </em>Here we have <em>a second </em>correction, by which he guards against its being suspected that his spirit was pusillanimous and broken down by adversities. For it was of importance that his constancy and moderation should be known by the Philippians, to whom he was a pattern of life. Accordingly he declares, that he had been gratified by their liberality in such a way that he could at the same time endure want with patience. <em>Want </em>refers here to disposition, for that man can never be poor in mind, who is satisfied with the lot which has been assigned to him by God. </p><p><em>In what state I am, </em>says he, that is, <em>“Whatever </em>my condition may be, I am satisfied with it.” Why? because saints know that they thus please God. Hence they do not measure sufficiency by abundance, but by the will of God, which they judge of by what takes place, for they are persuaded that their affairs are regulated by his providence and good pleasure. </p></div>
