His prayer is not only that God may bestow upon them his grace in large measure, but that they may have a proper feeling of it in their hearts.

Amen. </p><p>END OF THE COMMENTARIES ON THE<LineBreak />EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS. </p><p><strong>(105)</strong> “It is of little moment whether, by the ‘grace,’ we understand that free love and favour, which He always bears in his heart to all that believe in his name, or all that kindness — all those heavenly and spiritual blessings — in the communication of which He manifests this love, this free favour.” — Brown. </p></div>
