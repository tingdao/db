<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22</strong><em>Who is on the right hand of God. </em>He recommends to us the ascension of Christ unto heaven, lest our eyes should seek him in the world; and this belongs especially to faith. He commends to our notice his session on the Father’s right hand, lest we should doubt his power to save us. And what his <em>sitting </em>at the right hand of the Father means, we have elsewhere explained, that is, that Christ exercises supreme power everywhere as God’s representative. And an explanation of this is what follows, <em>angels being made subject to him; </em>and he adds <em>powers and authorities </em>only for the sake of amplification, for angels are usually designated by such words. It was then Peter’s object to set forth by these high titles the sovereignty of Christ. </p></div>
