<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here speaks more distinctly of a blessed issue, and shews that the punishment by which God had already chastised the people, and by which he was prepared to chastise the tribe of Judah, was wholly necessary, which he would give them as a medicine. For as long as we have set before us the wrath of God, we necessarily, as it has been already said, try to avoid it, because we wish well to ourselves, and endeavor to remove to a distance, as much as we can, whatever is adverse to us: hence the punishment which God inflicts is never pleasant to us, our sorrow in evils and adversities is never mitigated, nor do we quietly submit to God, unless we direct our minds to the fruit which distresses and chastisements bring forth. We now then perceive the object of the Prophet: the Jews always murmured and said, “Why does not God spare and forgive us? why does he not deal more gently with us?” The Prophet therefore shews, that God had a regard to the wellbeing of his people in chastising them; for had he indulged them in their sins, their pride and perverseness would have increased. </p><p>The intention then of these words is this, and it is for this end the Prophet speaks, — that the Jews might know that all their punishment, which would have been otherwise bitter and grievous, was a sort of medicine, by which their spiritual diseases were to be healed. </p><p>He therefore says, <em>Hearing I have heard Ephraim, after having transmigrated, </em>etc. The participle <span class="lang he-il">מתנודד</span>, <em>metnudad, </em>is in <em>Hithpael, </em>and comes from <span class="lang he-il">נוד</span><em>, nud, </em>or from <span class="lang he-il">נדד</span><em>nedad. </em>Some render it<em>, “transmigrating,” </em>and others, “lamenting.”But <span class="lang he-il">נוד</span>, <em>nud, </em>means to move, to wander, to migrate from one place to another; it means also to complain, to tell of adversities, though it is often applied to those whose object is to solace the miserable and the mournful. If any one prefers the rendering, “I have heard Ephraim lamenting,” I do not object, for there is a sufficient probability in its favor. But it may also be derived from <span class="lang he-il">נוד</span><em>, nud, </em>as well as from <span class="lang he-il">נדד</span><em>nedad; </em>the most suitable sense would then be, “after having moved into exile,” or literally, “after having transmigrated,” that is, after God had driven Ephraim, even the ten tribes, into exile. <span class="cite-ref">(36)</span></p><p>After Ephraim then had thus transmigrated, or had been driven into exile, he then began to say, <em>Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastened, for I was an untamed bullock: Turn thou me and I shall be turned; for thou, Jehovah, art my God. </em><span class="cite-ref">(37)</span> The Prophet, no doubt, as I said before, meant here to check the murmurs which prevailed among the Jews, who said, that God was too rigid and severe, he shews not only that they were worthy of the very grievous punishment they were suffering, but also that it was a testimony of God’s favor, that he thus intended to cleanse them from their sins; for they would have a hundred times grown putrid in their wickedness, had not God thus reduced them to a sound mind. He at the same time sets forth Ephraim as an example, that the Jews might resignedly follow their brethren, and not discontentedly bear their exile, seeing that it had already been profitable to their brethren. When therefore they perceived that their punishment was useful to the Israelites, and brought forth good fruit, they ought to have submitted themselves willingly to God, and not to have murmured against him for punishing them for their sins, but to have borne their exile as a paternal correction. </p><p>Then he says, “I have heard Ephraim,” — at what time? This circumstance ought to be especially noticed, it was after he had <em>transmigrated. </em>When they were quiet in the land, they were, as it follows, like untameable steers. The Prophets also use this mode of speaking, when they describe the Israelites before their dispersion; they call them fat and well fed oxen: affluence produced luxury, and luxury pride. Thus, then, they kicked, as it were, against God, according to what is said by Moses, </p><p>“My people having grown fat kicked.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Deu_32:15</span>) </p><p>As they were such, it was necessary that they should be tamed. And to this refers the time that is mentioned: when Ephraim was forcibly driven from his own country, then he began to acknowledge his evils and to be touched with a penitent feeling; “Thou hast chastised me,” he says, “and I was instructed.” The verb <span class="lang he-il">יסר</span>, <em>iser, </em>means to instruct as well as to chastise, and is applied to princes, counsellors, fathers, and magistrates. The word chastise is more restricted in Latin. But <span class="lang he-il">יסר</span><em>iser, </em>properly means to teach, and yet often it means to chastise, for that is one way of teaching or instructing. He then says that he was chastised, though in a different sense: in the first clause, when he says, “Thou hast chastised me,” he refers to the punishment by which God had humbled his people; and in the second clause he says, “I was instructed,” that is, “I begin now at length to become wise;” for it is the wisdom even of fools, not to become hardened under their calamities; for they who become hardened are altogether in a hopeless state. It is the chief part of wisdom to acknowledge what is right, and willingly to follow it; but, except we be willing to regard our own good, God will then chastise us. <span class="cite-ref">(38)</span></p><p>When our diseases are healable, we turn to God; but the perversely wicked bite and champ the bridle, and contend with God’s judgment: But the Prophet here refers to the faithful alone; for punishment has not the same effect on all indiscriminately. God, indeed, calls all men by punishment to repentance, so that even the reprobate are without excuse when they harden their hearts, and profit not under the rod. But punishment is peculiarlyuseful to the faithful; for God not only scourges them, but also, by his Spirit, bends their minds to docility, so that they willingly suffer themselves to be corrected by him. Hence I said that this clause properly refers to the faithful, when the Prophet says that Ephraim was <em>instructed, </em>after having been warned by punishment, to turn himself to God. </p><p>He compares himself to an untameable steer; for steers are wanton before they are habituated to the yoke. Such also is the wantonness of men before God subdues them by various kinds of punishment, and not only subdues them, but renders them also tractable and submissive. Next week I shall lecture instead of Beza. </p><p><strong>(36)</strong> The idea of “transmigrating” is alone given by the <em>Vulg., </em>the other versions and the <em>Targ. </em>have “lamenting:” and the latter is more consonant with the context, and has been adopted by almost all modern commentators. It is used in <span class="bvs">Jer_15:5</span>, in the sense of being moved or affected for another, of sympathizing or condoling. It is there in its simple form, that is, in <em>Kal. </em>As it is here in <em>Hithpael, </em>its meaning is, self-condoling, or condoling himself, — an idea which is very expressive, and is more fully explained in the next verse. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(37)</strong> This is no doubt the right rendering, and not, “Thou art Jehovah my God.” So in the first commandment, the version ought to be, “I Jehovah,” or, I the Lord, “am thy God.” The meaning is not, that he is Jehovah, but that he who is Jehovah is our God. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(38)</strong> The <em>Vulg. </em>and the <em>Targ. </em>favor this view of a different sense of the same verb in the second clause. The <em>Sept. </em>retain the same meaning. There is no need of altering the sense; indeed, another sense does not so well comport with the passage. He says that God had chastised him, and that he was chastised as an untamed, or rather untrained steer or bullock, implying that he was compelled to bear the yoke, and also that he had been brought to submit to it: hence the prayer that follows, “turn,” or rather, restore, etc. The verb <span class="lang he-il">יסר</span> means to correct rather than to chastise, even to correct by the rod, or by the goad; and then to teach as the effect of correction, — </p><p>Thou hast corrected me; <LineBreak />Yea, I was corrected like a steer, not trained: <LineBreak />Restore thou me, and I shall be restored; <LineBreak />For thou, Jehovah, art my God. </p><p>After a confession with regard to correction, a confession that intimates that it had its proper effect, a prayer for restoration seems suitable, and that prayer is founded on the fact that Jehovah was their God. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
