<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Tell me. </em>We see that God doth not by and by <span class="cite-ref">(243)</span> punish her, but first he trieth the matter thoroughly, lest he should send vengeance upon any save the obstinate, and those which will not be pardoned. <span class="cite-ref">(244)</span> For although Sapphira did know that the matter was hidden, she ought to have been stricken with this question of Peter, no otherwise than if she had been cited to appear before the judgment-seat of God. She hath a time granted her to repent; yea, this is, as it were, a pleasant <span class="cite-ref">(245)</span> inviting unto repentance. But she, in holding on so carelessly, <span class="cite-ref">(246)</span> doth declare that she was incurable, because she is touched with no fear of God. </p><p>And hereby are we taught to labor diligently to bring sinners into the way. For the Spirit of God keepeth this moderation; but when as stubbornness and the stubborn contempt of God is added unto the offense, it is now high time to punish. Therefore, those men are too arrogant who are displeased with the immoderate rigor of God. It is rather our duty to consider how we shall in time to come <span class="cite-ref">(247)</span> stand before the judgment-seat of God; although this is too much to despise his holy power and majesty, if we will have him mocked freely without any punishment. Moreover, so many circumstances, which before I have gathered, do sufficiently prove that Ananias and Sapphira were not worthy of one death only. For, first of all, hypocrisy is of itself very abominable to God. Secondly, whereas they are determined to lie unto God, this ariseth of great contempt, in that they do not reverence and fear Christ, being the Chief Governor of those amongst whom they were. It is ungodliness joined with impudency; because, so they can escape shame and reproach amongst men, before whom they were determined to vaunt and brag, they pass not to deny their manifest wickedness unto God. Whereas they do stubbornly deny their offense, this doth, as it were, make up the heap and measure. And whereas innumerable hypocrites do no less mock God and the Church daily, who, notwithstanding, are not punished with death, I have already showed why this ought to seem to be no inconvenient thing. <span class="cite-ref">(248)</span> Forasmuch as God is the only Judge of the world, it belongeth to him to punish every man at his pleasure, when and how it seemeth good to him. Wherefore we must not prescribe unto him a certain mean and manner of punishment. But the greatness of the spiritual judgment, which is as yet hid, hath been set before us in the bodily punishment of two, as in a mirror. For if we consider what it is to be cast into eternal fire, we shall not judge that this is the greatest evil and punishment of all, to fall down dead before men. Look the 10<span class="cite-ref">th</span> chapter of the First to the Corinthians, verse 5. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(243)</span> “Subito impetu,” by sudden impulse. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(244)</span> “Qui sibi veniam praecidunt,” who cut themselves off from pardon. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(245)</span> “Placida,” calm. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(246)</span> “Pergendo secure,” in proceeding securely. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(247)</span> “Olim,” one day. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(248)</span> “Absurdum,” absurd or strange. </p></div></div>
