<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>They which were with me. </em>I showed in the other place, that there is no such disagreement in the words of Luke as there seemeth to be. Luke said there, that though Paul’s companions stood amazed, yet heard they a voice.<span class="cite-ref">(502)</span> But in this place he saith, they heard not the voice of him which spake to Paul though they saw the light. Surely it is no absurd thing to say that they heard some obscure voice; yet so that they did not discern it as Paul himself, whom alone Christ meant to stay and tame with the reprehension. Therefore, they hear a voice, because a sound doth enter into their ears, so that they know that some speaketh from heaven; they hear not the voice of him that spake to Paul, because they understand not what Christ saith. Moreover, they see Paul compassed about with the light, but they see none which speaketh from heaven.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(502)</span></p><p>“ Vocem audisse, neminem vidisse,” heard a voice, and saw no one. </p></div></div>
