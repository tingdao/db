For although Jethro was his superior in age and in degree of affinity, in other respects he was far inferior to him. This yielding, then, of Moses to his authority, lays down a rule for all the greatest and most excellent Doctors, that they should not refuse lo receive the admonitions of those whom they admit to teach rightly, although they are not of such high dignity. For Cyprian <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span> truly declares that none is a good doctor who is not also docile. It is probable that the old man immediately returned home, not in contempt, or from his dislike to labor or fatigue, but <span class="cite-ref">(203)</span> on account of his age; but we shall hereafter see in its proper place that his son remained in the camp. </p><p><strong>(202)</strong> “Et ideo vir sanctus Cyprianus, (<strong>Ep. 74:12</strong>, ad Pompeium,) non solum doctus, sed etiam docibilis, quod in laude episcopi quem designat Apostolus sic intellexit ipse ut diceret: ‘etiam hoc in episcopo diligendum, ut non solum scienter doceat, sed etiam patienter discat.’” — <em>Aug. contra Donat</em>, lib. 4:7, vol. 9:125. </p><p><strong>(203)</strong> “Mais il est vray-semblable, que Moyse l’a volontiers excuse pour sa vieillesse;” but it is probable that Moses voluntarily excused him on account of his old age. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
