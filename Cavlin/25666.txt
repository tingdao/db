<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Show yourselves to the priests </em>This reply was equivalent to saying, “You are clean;” for we know that the discernment of leprosy belonged <em>to the priests, </em>who were enjoined in the law to distinguish between the clean and the unclean, (<span class="bvs">Lev_14:2</span>.) Thus Christ preserves their right entire, and appeals to them as witnesses for approving of the miracle which he had wrought; and we have accordingly said, that pious and devout sentiments concerning Christ must have been entertained by those men who were instantly led, by his bare word, to entertain the hope of a cure. </p><p>On this passage the Papists absurdly build their <em>auricular </em>confession. The lepers, I admit, were sent by Christ to the priests; but it was not for the purpose of vomiting out their sins into their ears. On the contrary, they were sent to offer a sacrifice, as the Law had enjoined. They were not sent to cleanse themselves, as the Papists imagine that cleanness is produced by confession, but to <em>show to the priests </em>that they were already clean. It is an additional proof of the folly of the Papists, that they do not consider what a foul stain of infamy they throw on their confession; for, according to their reasoning, it will be quite enough if, out of the whole troop of those who have gone <em>to the priests, </em>a tenth part only shall return to Christ, and all the rest shall wickedly revolt. They cannot plead this passage in behalf of their confession, without giving us liberty to throw back upon them this advantage which it yields, that none return from the priests <em>to give glory to God. </em>But, not to dwell on these fooleries, we have ascertained the reason why <em>the priests </em>were mentioned. </p><p><em>It happened that, while they were going, they were cleansed. </em>Here was displayed the divine power of Christ and of his words, and there was also a proof of the high estimation in which God holds the obedience of faith; for the great suddenness of the cure arose from the confident hope which induced them to undertake the journey, without hesitation, at the command of Christ. But if that transitory faith—which wanted a living root, and produced nothing more than the blade—was honored by God with a remarkable effect, how much more valuable is the reward that awaits our faith, if it is sincerely and permanently fixed on God? Though the <em>nine lepers </em>derived no advantage to salvation from the cure of the flesh, but only obtained a temporary gift by means of a fleeting and transitory faith, yet this figure points out to us the great efficacy which will attend true faith. </p></div>
