<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Through thee we have pushed, or smitten, with the horn our adversaries. </em><span class="cite-ref">(135)</span> The prophet here declares in what respect God had manifested himself to be the King of this people. He did so by investing them with such strength and power, that all their enemies stood in fear of them. The similitude, taken from bulls, which he here uses, tends to show, that they had been endued with more than human strength, by which they were enabled to assail, overturn, and trample under foot, every thing which opposed them. <em>In God, </em>and <em>in the name of God, </em>are of the same import, only the latter expression denotes, that the people had been victorious, because they fought under the authority and direction of God. It ought to be observed, that what they had spoken before concerning their fathers, they now apply to themselves, because they still formed a part of the same body of the Church. </p><p>And they do this expressly to inspire themselves with confidence and courage, for had they separated themselves from their fathers, this distinction would, in a certain sense, have interrupted the course of God’s grace, so that it would have ceased to flow down upon them. But now, since they confess that whatever God had conferred upon their fathers he had bestowed upon them, they may boldly desire him to continue his work. At the same time, it ought to be observed again in this place, that, as I have stated a little before, the reason why they ascribe their victories wholly to God is, that they were unable to arrive at such a consummation by <em>their own sword or their own bow. </em>When we are led to consider how great is our own weakness, and how worthless we are without God, this contrast much more clearly illustrates the grace of God. They again declare, (verse 7,) that they were saved by the power of God, and that he also had chased away and put to shame their enemies. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(135)</span> The allusion is to the pushing, striking, or butting of oxen and other animals with their horns, and means <em>to vanquish </em>or <em>subdue</em>, (<span class="bvs">Deu_33:17</span>; <span class="bvs">1Kg_22:11</span>; <span class="bvs">Dan_8:4</span>.) “Literally,” says Dr Adam Clarke, “We will toss them in the air with our horn; a metaphor taken from an ox or bull tossing the dogs into the air which attack him.” </p></div></div>
