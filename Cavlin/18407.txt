<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>O Lord, even to all who shall live after them. </em>The concise style of the Prophet has given rise to various interpretations. The interpretation most commonly received is “O Lord, they shall live beyond those years, <span class="cite-ref">(90)</span> ” that is, “they shall lengthen their life.” This is equivalent to saying, “When thou shalt have lengthened my life, thou wilt grant that others also shall enjoy the same favor.” But that meaning does not agree with the text, and I look upon it as forced. I rather think that Hezekiah’s meaning was this<em>” O Lord, whosoever shall live beyond those years, to them also will the life of my spirit be known.” </em>We must therefore supply the relative <span class="lang he-il">אשר</span>,<em>(asher,) who, </em>as the Hebrew writers frequently do, and there will be nothing forced in this interpretation; for there can be no doubt, and nobody denies it, that he speaks of the years which the Lord had lengthened out to him. Thus he means that, this favor will be acknowledged not only by the men of that age, but also by posterity. </p><p><em>And didst cause me to sleep, and didst make me alive. </em>In this way he magnifies the greatness of the favor, because it will also be well known to a future age, and will continue to be engraven on the remembrance of all, even when Hezekiah himself is dead, and not only so, but will be reckoned to be a kind of resurrection. By the word <em>sleep </em>he means death, as the Scriptures frequently do. (<span class="bvs">1Co_11:30</span>; <span class="bvs">1Th_4:14</span>; <span class="bvs">2Pe_3:4</span>.) Thus he compares this mortal disease to death; for he was so near death that he utterly despaired of life. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(90)</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Outre ces ans-ci</span>. </p></div></div>
