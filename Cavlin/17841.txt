<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>But the Lord will set up the adversaries of Rezin against him. </em>The Israelites having been proud of their alliance with the king of Syria, and hoping that everything would succeed to their wish, Isaiah threatens a new change which will take away all their hope and utterly frustrate their designs, for the Assyrians afterwards took arms and waged war with the Syrians. Accordingly, when <em>Rezin </em>had been slain, (<span class="bvs">2Kg_16:9</span>,) that country was entirely ruined. Still more does he heighten this, by adding, <em>he shall mingle</em>; <span class="cite-ref">(146)</span> for he means that the Lord will gather together and <em>mingle </em>various enemies whom he will commission to destroy the king of Syria, as the soldiers who composed the army of that vast monarchy were collected out of various nations. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(146)</span><em>And join his enemies together</em>. Margin, Heb. <em>mingle</em>. — Eng. Ver. — Calvin, in his version placed at the beginning of this Chapter, renders the clause, <em>and will join his enemies together</em>; but when he comes to explain it, he translates the Hebrew word literally, <em>he will mingle</em>. In both renderings the exact coincidence with our ordinary version deserves notice. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
