<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>And thou shalt take it an oil of holy ointment. </em>Although the genitive is put in the place of an epithet, as if Moses had said “a holy oil;” yet it is so called from its effect, because without it nothing is accounted pure. And assuredly the Spirit of God sanctifies ourselves and all that is ours, because without Him we are unholy, and all that belongs to us corrupt. He enjoins the use of the ceremony throughout all the generations of the ancient people, <span class="bvs">Exo_30:31</span>. In these words there is an implied contrast with the new Church, which wants no shadows since the manifestation of the substance; and justly does the only begotten Son of God possess the name of Christ, since by His coming He has abolished these figures. And Simeon, when he took Him in his arms, and called Him “the Lord’s Christ,” <span class="cite-ref">(183)</span> taught that the external use of the legal oil had ceased. So much the sillier is the superstition of the Papacy, when in imitation of the Jews it anoints its priests, and altars, and other toys: <span class="cite-ref">(184)</span> as if they desired to bury Christ again with their ointments; wherefore let us hold this invention in detestation as blasphemous, because it overthrows the limits prescribed by God. </p><p>In order that the Jews may hold this mystery in just reverence, he forbids similar ointment to be made. We know that ointments were then among the luxuries of a fine banquet; but it is accounted profanation if they make use of this kind; and we must mark the reason, that what is holy, may be holy unto them, <span class="bvs">Exo_30:32</span>, <em>i.e., </em>that they may reverently observe what is peculiarly devoted to their salvation. For although the sacred things divinely instituted always retain their nature, and cannot be either corrupted or made void by our vices, yet may we by our filthiness, by our impure use or neglect of them, pollute them as far as in us lies. </p><p><strong>(183)</strong> The reference here is to <span class="bvs">Luk_2:28</span>. It does not, however, appear that Simeon actually called Him “the Lord’s Christ,” though the Evangelist states, <span class="bvs">Luk_2:26</span>, that “it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ." </p><p><strong>(184)</strong><em>Lat., “ </em>Nugas;” <em>Fr, “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">L’autel avec tout leur </span><em class="lang fr-fr">bagage </em><em>.” “ </em>Now that your oil came not from the Apostles, your own doctor Panormitane is witness; for thus he writeth: ‘The Apostles in old time gave the Holy Ghost only by laying on of hands; but now-a-days, because bishops be not so holy, order hath been taken that they should give this sacrament with chrism.’” — Jewel’s Defence of the Apology, Parker Society’s edition, p. 178. </p><p>"Transtulerunt item sua haec olea, cure ad homines moribundos, tum etiam ad parietes, altaria, and campanas: necnon calices et alia hujusmodi, qum videmus, <span class="lang el-gr">κακοβηλίᾳ</span>improbanda ex veteri Judaismo esse traducta.
