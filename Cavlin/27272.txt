<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>A voice from heaven. </em>The voice came from heaven as did the sheet, that Peter might know that both came from God; neither had the sight done him any good, unless God had with this voice made clean those things which were before unclean. Whereas some pick an allegory out of the word kill, as if God did signify that men are sacrificed to him by the spiritual sword of the gospel; I do not prosecute that, but plainness pleaseth me better, that God doth take away by this voice the law concerning the choice of beasts, that he may also teach that he rejecteth no people, (<span class="bvs">Rom_15:16</span>.) For if by the former word be meant <em>sacrificing, </em>what shall <em>eat </em>signify? </p></div>
