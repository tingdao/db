<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>And Jesus approached and spoke to them. </em>His <em>approach </em>unquestionably removed all hesitation. Before relating that the office of teaching was committed to the disciples, Matthew says that Christ began by speaking of his <em>power; </em>and not without reason. For no ordinary authority would here have been enough, but sovereign and truly divine government ought to be possessed by him who commands them to promise eternal life in his ham to reduce the whole world under his sway, and to publish a doctrine which subdues all pride, and lays prostrate the whole of the human race. And by this preface Christ not only encouraged the Apostles to full confidence in the discharge of their office, but confirmed the faith of his gospel in all ages. Never, certainly, would the Apostles have had sufficient confidence to undertake so arduous an office, if they had not known that their Protector sitteth in heaven, and that the highest <em>authority is given to him; </em>for without such a support it would have been impossible for them to make any progress. But when they learn that he to whom they owe their services is the Governor of heaven and earth, this alone was abundantly sufficient for preparing them to rise superior to all opposition. As regards the hearers, if the contemptible appearance of those who preach the gospel weakens or retards their faith, let them learn to raise their eyes to the Master himself, by whose power the majesty of the Gospel ought to be estimated, and then they will not venture to despise him when speaking by his ministers. </p><p>He expressly calls himself the <em>Lord and King of heaven and earth, </em>because, by constraining men to obey him in the preaching of the gospel, he establishes his throne <em>on the earth; </em>and, by regenerating his people to a new life, and inviting them to the hope of salvation, he opens <em>heaven </em>to admit to a blessed immortality with angels those who formerly had not only crawled on the world, but had been plunged in the abyss of death. Yet let us remember that what Christ possessed in his own right was given to him by the Father in our flesh, or—to express it more clearly—in the person of the Mediator; for he does not lay claim to the eternal power with which he was endued before the creation of the world, but to that which he has now received, by being appointed to be Judge of the world. Nay, more, it ought to be remarked, that this authority was not fully known until he rose from the dead; for then only did he come forth adorned with the emblems of supreme King. To this also relate those words of Paul: </p><p>he emptied himself, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσε</span>,) therefore God hath exalted him, and given to him a name which is above every other name, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>.) </p><p>And though, in other passage the <em>sitting at the right hand of God </em>is placed after the ascension to heaven, as later in the order of time; yet as the resurrection and the ascension to heaven are closely connected with each other, with good reason does Christ now speak of his power in such magnificent terms. </p></div>
