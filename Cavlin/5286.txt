<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Certain men, the children of Belial. </em>Moses puts a case, which very often is wont to occur. For all do not break forth into impiety together at the same moment, but Satan stirs up some who are like fans to excite others; and by their instigations the multitude is led to imitate them. Moses calls such as these “children of Belial;” <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> by which word some think that rebellious (<em>proefractos </em>) men are pointed out, and expound it “without yoke.” Their opinion, however, seems to be more correct, who interpret it “men of nothing,” men in whom nothing good or praiseworthy is found; and literally translate it “those who are worthless.” <span class="cite-ref">(62)</span> This expression is invariably applied to the wicked (<em>sceleratis, improbis, et nequam </em><em>;</em>) and therefore Paul, contrasting Christ with Belial, designates by it Satan the chief of all the wicked. (<span class="bvs">2Co_6:15</span>.) He uses the words “gone out,” as if they had dared to come forward, and openly to parade their impiety. But, though the evil may have originated with a few authors, he does not mean that punishment should stop with them; as if the instigation of others availed as an excuse for the multitude. And he enjoins diligent inquiry to be made, for two reasons: viz., lest they should connive at the iniquity, and be lax, and careless about it, or lest they should be too hasty and precipitate in their judgment; because, on the one hand, whilst we are never equitable, nor decide rightly in precipitation and anger, so on the other it betrays base indifference, and something like disloyalty, to overlook so great a crime. Thus both activity and moderation are commended, so that the judge may neither be lax, nor make any decision until the matter shall be carefully inquired into. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(61)</span><span class="lang he-il">בליעל</span>,<em>Belial. </em>If the authority of the points be conceded, this word must be considered as composed of <span class="lang he-il">בלי</span>, <em>without, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">יעל</span>, <em>use, </em>or <em>profit, </em>so as to correspond with our expression <em>good-for-nothing; </em>but, if the points be disregarded, it might be considered as made up of <span class="lang he-il">בלי</span>, and <span class="lang he-il">על</span><em>, without yoke; </em>insubmissive, rebellious. <em>S.M.’s </em>note says, “Without the yoke of the Divine Law.” — W. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(62)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ausquels il ne se trouve pas une seule goutte de bien</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>.
