<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Purge out therefore </em>Having borrowed a similitude from <em>leaven</em>, he pursues it farther, though he makes a transition from a particular point to a general doctrine. For he is no longer speaking of the case of incest, but exhorts them generally to purity of life, on the ground that we cannot remain in Christ if we are not cleansed. He is accustomed to do this not infrequently. When he has made a particular statement, he takes occasion to pass on to general exhortations. He had made mention of <em>leaven </em>on another account, as we have seen. As this same metaphor suited the general doctrine which he now subjoins, he extends it farther. </p><p><em>Our Passover </em><span class="cite-ref">(288)</span> Before coming to the subject-matter, I shall say a few words in reference to the words. <em>Old leaven </em>receives that name on the same principle as the <em>old man</em>, (<span class="bvs">Rom_6:6</span>,) for the corruption of nature takes the precedence in us, previously to our being renewed in Christ. <em>That</em>, therefore, is said to be <em>old </em>which we bring with us from the womb, and must perish when we are renewed by the grace of the Spirit. <span class="cite-ref">(289)</span> The verb <span class="lang el-gr">ἐτύθη</span>, which occurs between the name <em>Christ </em>and the term which denotes a sacrifice, <span class="cite-ref">(290)</span> may refer to either. I have taken it as referring to the sacrifice, though this is of no great importance, as the meaning is not affected. The verb <span class="lang el-gr">ἑορτάζωμεν</span>, which Erasmus rendered “Let us celebrate the feast,” signifies also to partake of the solemn feast which was observed after the sacrifice had been offered up. This interpretation appeared to suit better with the passage before us. I have, accordingly, followed the Vulgate in preference to Erasmus, as this rendering is more in accordance with the mystery of which Paul treats. </p><p>We come now to the subject-matter. Paul, having it in view to exhort the Corinthians to holiness, shows that what was of old figuratively represented in the passover, ought to be at this day accomplished in us, and explains the correspondence which exists between the figure and the reality. In the first place, as the passover consisted of two parts — a sacrifice and a sacred feast — he makes mention of both. For although some do not reckon the paschal lamb to have been a sacrifice, yet reason shows that it was properly a sacrifice, for in that rite the people were reconciled to God by the sprinkling of blood. Now there is no reconciliation without a sacrifice; and, besides, the Apostle now expressly confirms if, for he makes use of the word <span class="lang el-gr">θύεσθαι</span>, which is applicable to sacrifices,and in other respects, too, the context would not correspond. The lamb, then, was sacrificed yearly; then followed a feast, the celebration of which lasted for seven successive days. <em>Christ</em>, says Paul, <em>is our Passover </em><span class="cite-ref">(291)</span> He was sacrificed once, and on this condition, that the efficacy of that one oblation should be everlasting. What remains now is, that we eat, <span class="cite-ref">(292)</span> not once a-year, but continually. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(288)</span> “Would any one,” asks <em>Hervey</em>, (in his <em>Theroa and Aspasio</em>, volume 1,) “venture to say — ‘Paul our passover is sacrificed for us?’ Yet this, I think, may be, or rather is in effect said, by the account which some persons give of Christ’s satisfaction. The very thought of such a blasphemous absurdity is too painful and offensive for the serious Christian to dwell upon. I would therefore direct his attention to a more pleasing object. Let him observe the exquisite skill which here and everywhere conducts the zeal of our inspired writer. The odes of Pindar are celebrated for their fine transitions, which, though bold and surprising, are perfectly natural. We have in this place,” (<span class="bvs">1Co_5:7</span>) “a very masterly stroke of the same beautiful kind. The Apostle, speaking of the incestuous criminal, passes, by a most artful digression, to his daring topic — a crucified Savior. Who would have expected it on such an occasion? Yet, when thus admitted, who does not see and admire both the propriety of the subject and the delicacy of its introduction?” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(289)</span> Our Author gives a similar definition of the expression <em>the old man</em>, when commenting on <span class="bvs">Rom_6:6</span>. “Totam antem naturam significat, quam afterlinus ex utero, quae adeo regni Dei capax non est, ut interire eatenus oporteat, quatenus in veram vitam instauramur;” — “It denotes the whole of that nature which we bring with us from the womb, and is so far from being fit for the kingdom of God, that it must perish, in so far as we are renewed to a true life.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(290)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Assauoir, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Pasque </em>;” — “Namely, <em>passover</em>. ” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(291)</span><em>Charnock </em>makes the following pointed observations on the form of expression here employed: — “<em>Christ the Passover </em>— <em>i e </em>the paschal lamb. The lamb was called the passover. The sign for the thing signified by it. <span class="bvs">2Ch_35:11</span>. And they killed the passover, <em>i e </em>the lamb; for the passover was properly the angel’s passing over <em>Israel</em>, when he was sent as an executioner of God’s wrath upon the <em>Egyptians </em>So <span class="bvs">Mat_26:17</span>. Where shall we prepare for thee to eat the passover? <em>i e </em>the paschal lamb. <em>Our passover</em>, <em>i e </em>our paschal lamb.
