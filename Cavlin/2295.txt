<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And take thou unto thee Aaron. </em>The calling of God is here alleged to prove the importance and dignity of the priesthood, and this too the Apostle has well weighed in the words: </p><p>"And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.” (<span class="bvs">Heb_5:4</span>.) </p><p>Among heathen nations the priests were appointed by popular election, so that ambition alone governed their appointment; but God would only have those accounted lawful priests whom He had selected at His own sole will; and surely the whole human race together had no power to obtrude any one on God, who should interpose himself to obtain pardon and peace; nay, not even Christ Himself would have been sufficient to propitiate God, unless He had undertaken the office by the decree and appointment of His Father. To which refers the famous oath, whereby His heavenly Father appointed Him to be priest; and so much the more vile and detestable was the sacrilege which afterwards prevailed in the Jewish nation, viz., that the successors of Aaron bought the priesthood! This unworthy traffic of the office, which Josephus relates, ought to awaken horror in us now, when we see that sacred honor profaned by the family which had been chosen by God to represent Christ. Nevertheless, however they may have violated all law and justice, still the counsel of God remained inviolable, that believers might know that the priesthood depended on His authority, just as reconciliation flows from His mere mercy. For in order that it should be lawful for men to establish a priest, it would be necessary that they should anticipate God by their own deservings; and from this they are very far distant. The case is different as to the election of the pastors of the Church; since, after Christ had instituted the order itself, He commanded that there should be chosen out of the Church those who by their doctrine and integrity of life were fitted to exercise the office. Still He does not thus resign His own right and power to men, for He does not cease through them to call those (by whom He would be served. <span class="cite-ref">(160)</span>) Wherefore, to shew that He is the sole author of the priesthood, God commands Aaron and his sons to be separated from among the others; and the performance of this He entrusts to Moses, whom, however, He does not elevate to the like honor. Moses consecrates Aaron, although he was never himself dedicated by anointing and investiture to the service of God; <span class="cite-ref">(161)</span> whence we perceive that the sacraments have their power and effect not from the virtue of the minister, but only from the commandment of God; for Moses would not have given to others what he had not himself, if it had not so pleased God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(160)</span> Added from <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(161)</span> “Ad Dei cultum.” —<em>Lat. “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">A sacrifier</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
