<div class="comment-content"><p>He afterwards adds, <em>Yet I said; </em>God here states, that he had long suspended his judgment before he punished the people of Israel. He then extols here his patience, that he had not immediately visited the Israelites as they deserved, but bore with them and for a long time waited to see whether they could be reclaimed: <em>I said, </em>then, <em>after she had done all these things, Return to me </em>If we read in the third person, the sense will be the same, “I hoped indeed that they would return to the right way, though they had thus fallen away, yea though they had denied me by an impious defection, and had become alienated from the faith and from piety.” But I am more inclined to another view, — that God here records the fact, that he had recalled to himself the ten tribes by his servants the Prophets, though they had by their many crimes provoked his wrath. Here then God shews how perverse the Israelites had been; for he had tried to restore them, if possible, to himself, but had spent all his labor in vain. I thus explain, <em>I said, </em>of the prophetic instruction: “Though then the Israelites had plunged themselves into impieties, I yet ceased not to try whether they could be restored to me.” He intimates, in short, that he had been unlike those husbands, who will not be reconciled to their wives, burning with jealousy, because they see that they had been exposed to so much disgrace. God then shews that though the Israelites had departed from him, he yet sent his prophets, and of his own free will sought reconciliation with them, but that they had refused to return. <span class="cite-ref">(78)</span></p><p>He then adds, <em>See did she, </em>that is, the whole kingdom of Judah, that, for al1 this, because the <em>rebellious Israel had played the harlot, etc</em>. We shall hereafter find the design of this comparison; for he amplifies the sin of the kingdom of Judah, inasmuch she had time enough to observe what he now relates, and was able to see it at a distance as it were from a watchtower; yet she saw it without any advantage. God then intended to shew how great was the hardness of the Jews, who had seen the defection of the ten tribes, and had seen how severely they had been reproved by the prophets. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(78)</span> The difficulty at the beginning of the eighth verse may be removed either by adopting <span class="lang he-il">ואראה</span>, as in two MSS., and taking the verb to be in Hiphil, or <span class="lang he-il">ותרא</span>, as in one MS., as a repetition of the former verb, according to the <em>Syriac </em>It is left out in the <em>Vulgate </em>But it is most suitable to the context to take the verb to be in Hiphil. Then the passage would read thus, — </p><p><span class="cite-note">6.</span>Hast thou not seen what she did, the apostate Israel? Go did she on every high hill and under every green tree, And play there the harlot: </p><p><span class="cite-note">7.</span>And I said, after she had done all these things, “To me return;” but she returned not: And see this did the hypocrite, her sister Judah: </p><p><span class="cite-note">8.</span>And I caused her to see, that on all these accounts, As adultery the apostate Israel would commit, I dismissed her, and gave to her The bill of her divorcement; Yet fear not, did the hypocrite Judah, her sister, But went and played the harlot, even herself. </p><p>“On all these accounts,” or, for all these reasons, refers to several things-the first apostasy — God’s invitation — and Israel’s refusal. God caused Judah to see these things by his prophets, but Judah feared not. The word <span class="lang he-il">בגדה</span>, hypocrite, or the perfidious one, is a feminine participle, used as a noun. It is explained in the tenth verse by “feignedly” or falsely. Hypocrites would be the correct rendering. It is rendered by the <em>Septuagint, “ </em>faithless — <span class="lang el-gr">ασύνθετος</span>,” — by the <em>Vulgate, “ </em>prevaricatress — praevaricatrix, “and by the <em>Targum, “ </em>falsifier” or cheat. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
