<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong>Stephen saith, that the patriarchs were carried into the land of Canaan after they were dead. But Moses maketh mention only of the bones of Joseph, (<span class="bvs">Gen_1:13</span>.) And <span class="bvs">Jos_24:32</span>, it is reported, that the bones of Joseph were buried without making any mention of the rest. Some answer, that Moses speaketh of Joseph for honor’s sake, because he had given express commandment concerning his bones, which we cannot read to have been done of the rest. And, surely, when Jerome, in the pilgrimage of Paula, saith, that she came by Shechem, he saith that she saw there the sepulchres of the twelve patriarchs; but in another place he maketh mention of Joseph’s grave only. And it may be that there were empty tombs <span class="cite-ref">(404)</span> erected to the rest. I can affirm nothing concerning this matter for a certainty, save only that this is either a speech wherein is <em>synecdoche, </em>or else that Luke rehearseth this not so much out of Moses, as according to the old fame; as the Jews had many things in times past from the fathers, which were delivered, as it were, from hand to hand. And whereas he saith afterward, they were laid in the sepulcher which Abraham had bought of the sons of Hemor, it is manifest that there is a fault [mistake] in the word Abraham. For Abraham had bought a double cave of Ephron the Hittite, (<span class="bvs">Gen_23:9</span>,) to bury his wife Sarah in; but Joseph was buried in another place, to wit, in the field which his father Jacob had bought of the sons of Hemor for an hundred lambs. Wherefore this place must be amended. </p><p><strong>(404)</strong> “[<span class="lang el-gr">Κενοτάφια</span> ],” ceonotaphs. </p></div>
