<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>How long wilt thou withdraw thy hand? </em>It is easy to see what the prophet here intends, and yet interpreters are not agreed as to the words. Some by the word <em>hand, </em>in the first part of the verse, understand <em>the left hand, </em>to distinguish it from <em>the right hand, </em>mentioned in the last clause of the verse. But this is mere trifling; for when he uses the term <em>right hand, </em>he simply repeats the same thing according to his usual manner. Some translate the verb <span class="lang he-il">כלה</span>, <em>kalah, </em>the last word of the verse, by <em>hinder </em>or <em>restrain, </em>as if the prophet had said, Do thou at length stretch forth thy hand, which has been kept too long in thy bosom. But this is a forced sense, to which they have recourse without any color of reason. Those who translate it <em>consume </em>understand <em>the midst of God’s bosom, </em>as denoting allegorically his temple, <span class="cite-ref">(228)</span> an interpretation of which I cannot approve. It will be better to continue the interrogation to the last word in this way: “How long wilt thou withdraw thy hand? Yea, wilt thou withdraw it from the midst of thy bosom? Consume, therefore, these ungodly men who so proudly despise thee.” We may also not improperly view the words as a prayer that as God’s enemies persuaded themselves that he was slothful and idle, because he did not bestir himself, nor openly lift up his hand; he would cause them to feel that he was perfectly able to destroy them with his nod alone, although he should not move so much as a finger. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(228)</span> “The Jewish Arab reads, ‘Turn not from them thy hand, even thy right hand, but consume them out of the midst of thy house,’ giving a note, that the <em>house of God </em>is called <span class="lang he-il">חיק</span>.” —<em>Hammond </em></p></div></div>
