<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord. </em>It is evident that Balaam, in order to gratify the wicked king for the sake of the reward, endeavored by various shifts and expedients to obtain an answer in accordance with his wishes. Thus do the wicked seek to propitiate God by delusive means, just as we soothe children by coaxing. And God for some time allowed him <span class="cite-ref">(163)</span> to gloat upon his fallacious oracle. He now, however, lays closer constraint upon him, and, breaking off all delay, dictates an answer, which He compels him to deliver. For his obedience is not here praised as if, when he understood the will of God, he yielded voluntarily and abandoned his monstrous cupidity; but, because now there was no more room for subterfuge, he dared not stir his foot, as if God had put forth His hand to retain him in his place. </p><p>When it is said that “the Spirit of God was upon him,” <span class="cite-ref">(164)</span> after he turned his eyes “toward the wilderness” and beheld the camp of Israel, how they were marshalled “according to their tribes,” we must understand it thus: not that he was influenced by a sincere feeling of good-will, so that the sight itself suggested grounds for blessing; but that he was induced by the inspiration of the same Spirit, who afterwards put forth His influence in the prophecy itself. It is said, then, that the Spirit of God was upon him, not as if it had begun to inspire him at that particular moment when he cast his eyes upon the camp of Israel; but because it prompted him to look in that direction, in order that the impulse of prophecy might be stronger in him, as respecting a thing actually before his eyes. But after the Spirit had thus affected his senses, or at any rate had prepared them to be fit instruments for the execution of his office, it then also directed his tongue to prophesy; but in an extraordinary manner, so that a divine majesty shone forth in the sudden change, as if he were transformed into a new man. In a word, “the Spirit of God was upon him,” shewing by manifest token that He was the author of his address, and that he did not speak of his own natural intelligence. To the same intent it is said that “he took up his parable,” because <span class="cite-ref">(165)</span> the character of his address was marked with unusual grandeur and magnificent brilliancy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(163)</span> “Inhiare fallaci oraculo.” —<em>Lat. </em>“Q’uil fust comme a la chasse, pour obtenir quelque fausse revelation;” to be, as it were, in chase of some false revelation. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(164)</span><em>A.
