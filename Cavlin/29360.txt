<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Peace be to the brethren. </em>I consider the word <em>peace, </em>as in the salutations of the Epistles, to mean <em>prosperity. </em>Yet if the reader shall prefer to view it as signifying <em>harmony, </em>because, immediately afterwards, Paul mentions <em>love, </em>I do not object to that interpretation, or rather, it agrees better with the context. He wishes the Ephesians to be peaceable and quiet among themselves; and this, he presently adds, may be obtained by brotherly <em>love </em>and by agreement in <em>faith </em>From this prayer we learn that <em>faith </em>and <em>love, </em>as well as <em>peace </em>itself, are gifts of God bestowed upon us through Christ, â€” that they come equally <em>from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </em></p></div>
