<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>He hath remembered his goodness </em>Having spoken of the general manifestation of his salvation, he now celebrates his goodness more particularly to his own chosen people. God exhibited himself as a Father to Gentiles as well as Jews; but to the Jews first, who were, so to speak, the first-born. <span class="cite-ref">(109)</span> The glory of the Gentiles lay in their being adopted and in-grafted into the holy family of Abraham, and the salvation of the whole world sprung from the promise made to Abraham, as Christ said, “Salvation is of the Jews,” (<span class="bvs">Joh_4:22</span>) The Psalmist therefore very properly observes, that God in redeeming the world <em>remembered his truth, </em>which he had given to Israel his people — language, too, which implies that he was influenced by no other motive than that of faithfully performing what he had himself promised. <span class="cite-ref">(110)</span> The more clearly to show that the promise was not grounded at all on the merit or righteousness of man, he mentions the <em>goodness </em>of God first, and afterwards his <em>faithfulness, </em>which stood connected with it. The cause, in short, was not to be found out of God himself, (to use a common expression,) but in his mere good pleasure, which had been testified long before to Abraham and his posterity. The word <em>remembered </em>is used in accommodation to man’s apprehension; for what has been long suspended seems to have been forgotten. Upwards of two thousand years elapsed from the time of giving the promise to the appearance of Christ, and as the people of God were subjected to many afflictions and calamities, we need not wonder that they should have sighed, and given way to ominous fears regarding the fulfillment of this redemption. When it is added, <em>all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of God, </em>this is not merely commendatory of the greatness of the salvation, meaning that it should be so illustrious that the report of it would reach the ends of the earth; but it signifies that the nations formerly immersed in delusions and superstitions would participate in it. </p><p><strong>(109)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin qu’ils fussent comme les aisnez</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(110)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il n’a point este induit par autre raison, sinon afin que fidelement il accomplist ce qu’il avoit promis</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
