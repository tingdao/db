<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>For a just man</em>, <em>etc. </em>The meaning of the passage has constrained me to render the particle <span class="lang el-gr">γὰρ</span> as an affirmative or declarative rather than as a causative. The import of the sentence is this, “Most rare, indeed, is such an example to be found among men, that one dies for a just man, though this may sometimes happen: but let this be granted, yet for an ungodly man none will be found willing to die: this is what Christ has done.” <span class="cite-ref">(160)</span> Thus it is an illustration, derived from a comparison; for such an example of kindness, as Christ has exhibited towards us, does not exist among men. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(160)</span> [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] has omitted what is said of the “good” man; for whom, it is said, one would perhaps even dare to die. The “just<span class="lang el-gr">,” δίκαιος, </span> is he who acts according to what justice requires, and according to what the Rabbins say, “What is mine is mine, and what is thine is thine,” <span class="lang he-il">שלי שלי ושלך שלך</span> : but the “good<span class="lang el-gr">,” ἀγαθὸς, </span> is the kind, the benevolent, the beneficient, called <span class="lang he-il">טוב</span> in Hebrew; who is described by [<span class="bvs">Cicero </span>] as one who does good to those to whom he can, (vir bonus est is, qui prodest quibus potest.) </p><p>There is here an evident contrast between these words and those employed in <span class="bvs">Rom_5:6</span>, to designate the character of those for whom Christ died. The just<span class="lang el-gr">, δίκαιος, </span> is the opposite of the “ungodly<span class="lang el-gr">,” ἀσέβης; </span> who, by not worshipping and honoring God, is guilty of injustice of the highest kind, and in this sense of being unjust it is found in <span class="bvs">Rom_4:5</span>, where God is said to “justify the ungodly,” that is, him who is unjust by withholding from God the homage which rightly belongs to him. [<span class="bvs">Phavorinus </span>] gives<span class="lang el-gr">ἀθέμιτος, </span> unlawful, unjust, as one of its meanings. — What forms a contrast with “good” is sinner<span class="lang el-gr">, ἁμαρτωλός, </span> which often means wicked, mischievous, one given to vice and the doing of evil. [<span class="bvs">Suidas </span>] describes<span class="lang el-gr">ἁμαρτωλοί </span> as those who determine to live in transgression<span class="lang el-gr">, οἱ παρανομίᾳ συζὢν προαιρούμενοι; </span> and [<span class="bvs">Schleusner </span>] gives “scelestus — wicked,” “flagitiosus — full of mischief,” as being sometimes its meaning. </p><p>But the description goes farther, for in <span class="bvs">Rom_5:10</span> the word “enemies<span class="lang el-gr">ἐχθροὶ,</span> ” is introduced in order to complete the character of those for whom Christ died. They were not only “ungodly,” and therefore unjust towards God, and “wicked,” given to all evils; but also “enemies,” entertaining hatred to God, and carrying on war, as it were, against him. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
