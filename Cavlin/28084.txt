<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>By no means: know ye not? </em>This is not a bare denial as some think, as though he preferred to express his abhorrence of such a question rather than to disprove it: for a confutation immediately follows, derived from a contrary supposition, and to this purpose, “Between the yoke of Christ and that of sin there is so much contrariety, that no one can bear them both; if we sin, we give ourselves up to the service of sin; but the faithful, on the contrary have been redeemed from the tyranny of sin, that they may serve Christ: it is therefore impossible for them to remain bound to sin.” But it will be better to examine more closely the course of reasoning, as pursued by Paul. </p><p><em>To whom we obey</em>, <em>etc. </em>This relative may be taken in a causative sense, as it often is; as when one says, — there is no kind of crime which a parricide will not do, who has not hesitated to commit the greatest crime of all, and so barbarous as to be almost abhorred even by wild beasts. And Paul adduces his reason partly from the effects, and partly from the nature of correlatives. For first, if they obey, he concludes that they are servants, for obedience proves that he, who thus brings one into subjection to himself, has the power of commanding. This reason as to service is from the effect, and from this the other arises. “If you be servants, then of course sin has the dominion.” </p><p><em>Or of obedience</em>, <em>etc. </em>The language is not strictly correct; for if he wished to have the clauses correspondent, he would have said, “or of righteousness unto life” <span class="cite-ref">(195)</span> But as the change in the words does not prevent the understanding of the subject, he preferred to express what righteousness is by the word <em>obedience</em>; in which however there is a metonymy, for it is to be taken for the very commandments of God; and by mentioning this without addition, he intimated that it is God alone, to whose authority consciences ought to be subject. Obedience then, though the name of God is suppressed, is yet to be referred to him, for it cannot be a divided obedience. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(195)</span> [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] <em>’s </em>remark on this is, — that obedience is not the cause of life, as sin is of death, but is the way to life: and hence the want of correspondence in the two clauses. But others, such as [<span class="bvs">Venema </span>], [<span class="bvs">Turrettin </span>], and [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>], consider that the clauses really correspond. They take<span class="lang el-gr">εἰς θάνατον </span> — “unto death,” as signifying, unto condemnation; and<span class="lang el-gr">εἰς δικαιοσύνην, </span> they render “unto justification;” and<span class="lang el-gr">ὑπακόη, </span> “obedience,” is in their view the obedience of faith. This construction might be admitted, were it not for the last clause of <span class="bvs">Rom_6:18</span>, where we have, “Ye became the servants of righteousness,” the same word<span class="lang el-gr">, δικαιοσύνη; </span> except we consider that also, as [<span class="bvs">Venema </span>] does, as signifying the righteousness of faith, by a sort of personification: and if so, we must attach the same meaning to “righteousness<span class="lang el-gr">” δικαιοσύνη, </span> in <span class="bvs">Rom_6:19</span>, which issues in, or leads to holiness; and also to “righteousness<span class="lang el-gr">,” δικαιοσύνη, </span> in <span class="bvs">Rom_6:20</span>. As the Apostle personifies sin, he may also be supposed to personify righteousness, that is, the righteousness of faith. In this case, we might as well retain the word “righteousness” in this verse, and not justification, which it never strictly means; for the correspondence in the terms would be still essentially preserved, as with the righteousness of faith eternal life is inseparably connected. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
