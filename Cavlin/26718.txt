<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>If you were of the world. </em>This is another consolation, that the reason why they are <em>hated by the world </em>is, that they have been separated from it. Now, this is their true happiness and glory, for in this manner they have been rescued from destruction. </p><p><em>But I have chosen you out of the world. To choose </em>means here <em>to separate </em>Now, if they were <em>chosen out of the world</em>, it follows that they were a part <em>of the world</em>, and that it is only by the mercy of God that they are distinguished from the rest who perish. Again, by the term, <em>the world</em>, Christ describes, in this passage, all who have not been regenerated by the Spirit of God; for he contrasts the Church with <em>the world</em>, as we shall see more fully under the seventeenth chapter. And yet this doctrine does not contradict the exhortation of Paul, </p><p>Be at peace with all men, as far as lieth in you, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_12:18</span>;) </p><p>for the exception which he adds amounts to saying, that we ought to see what is right and proper for us to do that no man, by seeking to please <em>the world</em>, may give himself up to its corruptions. </p><p>But there is still another objection that may be urged; for we see that it commonly happens that wicked men, who are <em>of the world</em>, are not only <em>hated</em>, but accursed by others. In this respect, certainly, <em>the world loveth </em>not <em>what is its own</em>. I reply, earthly men, who are regulated by the perception of their flesh, never have a true hatred of sin, but only so far as they are affected by the consideration of their own convenience or injury. And yet the intention of Christ was not to deny that <em>the world </em>foams and rages within itself by internal quarrels. He only intended to show, <em>that the world hates </em>nothing in believers but what is of God. And hence, too, it plainly appears how foolish are the dreams of the Anabaptists, who conclude, from this single argument that they are the servants of God, because they displease the greater part of men. For it is easy to reply, that many who are <em>of the world </em>favor their doctrine, because they are delighted at the thought of having every thing in shameful confusion; while many who are <em>out of the world </em>hate it, because they are desirous that the good order of the state should remain unbroken. </p></div>
