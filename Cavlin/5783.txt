He mentions three especial scourges, pestilence, famine, and the sword, on which the prophets constantly dilate, when their object was to apply the Law to the actual use of the people, from whence it arose that they familiarly employ many of the expressions used by Moses. He introduces indeed other punishments, which the prophets also mention; but the sum of what he says is this, that the Israelites should feel that God was armed with all the punishments which were only too well known by experience, and by them would utterly destroy them. </p><p>First., he says, that they should be dried up, or rather roasted with hunger. <span class="cite-ref">(271)</span> Instead of pestilence he uses the words <em>burning (uredinem,) </em>and <em>bitter destruction: </em>and before he speaks of the sword, declares that He would send forth <em>beasts </em>and <em>serpents, </em>so that on the one hand, open violence should assail them, and, on the other, secret wiles. Amos has also imitated this figure: </p><p>“The day of the Lord (he says) is darkness and not light: as if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Amo_5:18</span>.) </p><p>To war, and the cruelty of enemies he adds another evil, viz., <em>terror</em>: and this is, indeed, an aggravation worse than death itself, when we tremble within with terror, for it would be better to be slain ten times over bravely fighting in battle, than to be consumed with constant fear, as by a lingering death. <span class="cite-ref">(272)</span></p><p>Let us learn, then, from this passage, that, whatever perils surround us, and whatever adversities, they are God’s weapons, and that they do not occur by chance to this or that person, but are directed by His hand. Thus it is the case that He not; only stirs up enemies against us, but fierce and noisome beasts also; that He shuts up the heaven and the earth; that He infects the atmosphere with deadly disease; that, in a word, he draws forth from all the elements manifold means of destruction. </p><p>But if it be the fact, that the godly are involved in similar punishments, since they suffer from hunger and want, and are not exempt from any evil; for even Paul acknowledges that he had himself experienced what God here denounces against those that wickedly despise Him, for he says that he was <em>troubled without </em>with <em>fightings, </em>and <em>within </em>with<em>fears, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_7:5</span>;) we must bear in mind that all adversities are in themselves signs of God’s wrath, since they derive their origin from sin; but that through God’s marvelous provision it comes to pass, that to believers they are exercises of their faith and proofs of their patience. Hence we often see God’s children afflicted in common with the ungodly, but to a different end; though nevertheless all adversities are proofs of God’s wrath against the reprobate. On this point I have spoken at greater length in treating of the curses of the Law. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(271)</span> Professor Liebig has pointed out the dreadful fact, in singular confirmation of the expression here employed by Moses, that “when a person is starved to death, he is, in fact, slowly burnt, as, during the process of starvation, a slow combustion of the body takes place.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(272)</span> Un accessoire pire que toutes los morts du monde, quand nous maigrissons et sommes minez de frayeur;” an aggravation worse than all the deaths in the world, when we are wasted away, and preyed upon by fear. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
