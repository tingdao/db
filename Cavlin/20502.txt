<div class="comment-content"><p>Now the Prophet more fully explains what we have just dwelt upon. He narrates how a <em>volume of a book was offered to him: </em>that is, a book in the form of a roll was offered to him. For the noun which he uses, <span class="lang he-il">מגלת</span>, <em>megleth, </em>comes from <span class="lang he-il">גלל</span>, <em>gelel, </em>to roll, as the word <em>volume </em>among the Latins. For they were formerly accustomed to write on rolls, that is, they had not the form of books so compact and well arranged as we now use, but they had volumes, which barbarians call rolls. Ancient documents were written in this way, for there is nothing ancient in the archives of princes which is not written on rolls. Hence the phrase, “In the volume of the book it is written of me,” etc. (<span class="bvs">Psa_40:8</span>; <span class="bvs">Heb_10:7</span>.) Now the Prophet says, <em>such a volume was offered to me that I might eat it; </em>and he adds<em>, it was offered to me by a hand sent forth, </em>But by this symbol God more clearly shows that the volume was not merely formed in the air, nor was produced anywhere but in heaven. For if the Prophet had only seen a volume presented to him, he might doubt whether it was sent by God or not. But when the hand which offers the volume appears, and is truly sent forth from God, nothing is wanting for full and complete certainty. </p></div>
