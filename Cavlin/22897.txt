<div class="comment-content"><p>Now follows another vision, by which God confirms what he had before testified to his Prophet. He then says, that though enemies should on every side rise up against the Church and cause it many troubles, there was yet a remedy in God’s hand, as he would break in pieces all horns by his hammers. He compares the Gentiles, who had been hostile to the Jews, to horns; and he afterwards compares to workmen the other enemies, whose hand and labor God would use for the purpose of breaking down the efforts of all those who would be troublesome to the Church. The import of the whole then is, — that though the Church would not be exempt and free from troubles, and those many, yet God would have in his hand those remedies by which he would check all the assaults of the wicked, however impetuously and violently they may rage against his miserable Church. </p><p>But let us see in the first place why the Prophet mentions <em>four horns</em>. The Jews refer to the Assyrians and the Babylonians, to the Persian, the Grecians, and the Romans; because we find in other places, and Daniel especially shows very clearly, (<span class="bvs">Dan_2:32</span>,) that there were to be four principal monarchies, by which God intended to give clear and memorable examples of his judgments. But the Prophet, I have no doubt, speaks here of the Moabites and of the Syrians, and of other nations, as well as of the Assyrians or Chaldees. They are then mistaken, as I think, who suppose that these four monarchies are intended here: <span class="cite-ref">(27)</span> but Zechariah says that they were four horns, because they arose from the four quarters of the world; for we know that the Jews were not harassed only on one side, but on the east and the west, on the north and the south. Since then enemies on every side joined their strength and their forces against the Jews, so that there was a cause for trembling from the four quarters of the world, that is, from all places around them, the Prophet says, that they had been <em>scattered by four horns </em></p><p>This view, however, seems still frigid, because it was not necessary for the Prophet to state what was well known to all: but God intended to show that the nations which had been inimical and hostile to the Jews, had done nothing but through his hidden impulse, in order that the Jews might understand that these were so many scourges by which he purposed to chastise them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(27)</span> Some of the Rabbins,<em>Jerome</em>, <em>Vatablus</em>, and latterly <em>Blayney</em>, have adopted this view; but it is wholly inadmissible. The single reason that the <em>past </em>enemies of the Jews are here referred to, is a sufficient refutation. The number <em>four </em>is differently accounted, for by <em>Cyril </em>and some others. It is explained of the four principal enemies of the Jews — Pul, Shalmenezar, Sennacherib, and Nebuchadnezzar. But what <em>Calvin </em>says seems most satisfactory. “Why four? to denote that these kingdoms had many enemies, enemies on every side, <span class="bvs">Ezr_4:1</span>; <span class="bvs">Neh_4:7</span>.” — <em>Newcome</em>. With this view <em>Theodoret</em>, <em>Marckius</em>, and <em>Henderson </em>also agree. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
