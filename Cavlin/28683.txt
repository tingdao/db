<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>I would that ye all spake with tongues </em>Again he declares that he does not give such a <em>preference </em>to prophecy, as not to leave some place for foreign tongues. This must be carefully observed. For God has conferred nothing upon his Church in vain, and languages were of some benefit. <span class="cite-ref">(812)</span> Hence, although the Corinthians, by a misdirected eagerness for show, had rendered that gift partly useless and worthless, and partly even injurious, yet Paul, nevertheless, commends the use of tongues. So far is he from wishing them abolished or thrown away. At the present day, while a knowledge of languages is more than simply necessary, and while God has at this time, in his wonderful kindness, brought them forward from darkness into light, there are at present great theologians, who declaim against them with furious zeal. As it is certain, that the Holy Spirit has here honored the use of tongues with never-dying praise, we may very readily gather, what is the kind of spirit that actuates those reformers, <span class="cite-ref">(813)</span> who level as many reproaches as they can against the pursuit of them. At the same time the cases are very different. For Paul takes in languages of any sort — such as served merely for the publication of the gospel among all nations. They, on the other hand, condemn those languages, from which, as fountains, the pure truth of scripture is to be drawn. An exception is added — that we must not be so taken up with the use of languages, as to treat with neglect <em>prophecy, </em>which ought to have the first place. </p><p><em>Unless he interpret. </em>For if interpretation is added, there will then be prophecy. You must not, however, understand Paul to give liberty here to any one to <em>take </em>up the time of the Church to no profit by muttering words in a foreign tongue. For how ridiculous it were, to repeat the same thing in a variety of languages without any necessity! But it often happens, that the use of a foreign tongue is seasonable. In short, let us simply have an eye to this as our end — that edification may redound to the Church. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(812)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les langues aidoyent lors aucunement a l’auancement des Eglises</span>;” — “Languages, at that time, were of some help for the advancement of the Churches.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(813)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ces gentils reformateurs</span>;” — “Those pretty reformers.” </p></div></div>
