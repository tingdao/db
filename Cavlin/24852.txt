<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_15:25</span><em>And it was the third hour. </em>This appears not to agree well with the testimony of the Evangelist John; for he relates that Christ was condemned <em>about the sixth hour, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mar_14:14</span>.) But if we consider—what is evident from other passages—that the day was divided into four parts, and that each of the parts took its name from the first hour of its commencement, the solution will not be difficult. The whole time, from sunrise to the second part of the day, they called <em>the first </em>hour. The second part, which lasted till noon, was called by them the <em>third </em>hour. The <em>sixth </em>hour commenced at noon, and lasted till three or four o’clock in the afternoon. Thus, when the Jews saw that Pilate was wearing out the time, and that the hour of noon was approaching, John <em>says </em>that <em>they cried out </em>the more vehemently, that the whole day might not be allowed to pass without something being done, (<span class="bvs">Mar_14:15</span>.) But this is not inconsistent with the assertion, that our Lord was crucified about the close of <em>the third hour; </em>for it is plain enough, that no sooner was he hastily condemned, than he was immediately executed; so eager was the desire of the Jews to put him to death. Mark therefore means not the beginning, but the close, of the third hour; and it is highly probable that Christ did not hang on the cross longer than three hours. </p></div>
