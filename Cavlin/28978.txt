<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>That are according to appearance. </em>In the first place, the clause <em>according to appearance</em>, may be taken in two ways: either as meaning the reality itself, visible and manifest, or an outward mask, <span class="cite-ref">(765)</span> that deceives us. The sentence, too, may be read either interrogatively or affirmatively: nay more, the verb <span class="lang el-gr">βλέπετε </span> may be taken either in the imperative mood, or in the subjunctive. I am rather of opinion, however, that it is expressive of chiding, and that the Corinthians are reaproved, because they suffered their eyes to be dazzled with empty show. “You greatly esteem others who swell out with mighty airs of importance, while you look down upon me, because I have nothing of show and boasting.” For Christ himself contrasts the <em>judgment that is according to appearance </em>with <em>righteous judgment</em>. (<span class="bvs">Joh_7:24</span>, and <span class="bvs">Joh_8:15</span>.) Hence he reproves the Corinthians, because, contenting themselves with show, or appearance, they did not seriously consider, what kind of persons ought to be looked upon as the servants of Christ. </p><p><em>If any one trusteth in himself </em>— an expression that is full of great confidence, for he takes it, as it were, for granted, that he is so certainly a minister of Christ, that this distinction cannot be taken from him. “Whoever,” says he, “is desirous to be looked upon as a minister of Christ, must necessarily count me in along with himself.” For what reason? “<em>Let him</em>, ” says he. “<em>think for himself</em>, for whatever things he may have in himself, that make him worthy of such an honor, the same will he find in me.” By this he hinted to them, that whoever they might be that reviled him, ought not to be looked upon as the servants of Christ. It would not become all to speak thus confidently, for it might certainly happen — nay, it happens every day, that they same claim is haughtily advanced by persons, that are of no reputation, and are nothing else than a dishonor to Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(766)</span> Paul, however, affirmed nothing respecting himself but what he had openly given proof of by clear and sure evidences among the Corinthians. Now should any one, while destitute of all proof of the reality, recommend himself in a similar manner, what would he do but expose himself to ridicule? To<em>trust in one’s self </em>is equivalent to assuming to one’s self power and authority on the pretext that he serves Christ, while he is desirous to be held in estimation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(765)</span> "<span class="lang fr-fr">La masque et apparence exterieure</span>;" — "An outward mask and appearance." </p><p><span class="cite-note">(766)</span> "<span class="lang fr-fr">Vn tas de garnement</span>;" — "A band of profligates." </p></div></div>
