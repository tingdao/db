<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>But let patience have her perfect work. </em>As boldness and courage often appear in us and soon fail, he therefore requires perseverance. “Real patience,” he says, “is that which endures to the end.” For <em>work </em>here means the effort not only to overcome in one contest, but to persevere through life. His perfection may also he referred to the sincerity of the soul, that men ought willingly and not feignedly to submit to God; but as the word <em>work </em>is added, I prefer to explain it of constancy. For there are many, as we have said, who shew at first an heroic greatness, and shortly after grow weary and faint. He therefore bids those who would be <em>perfect </em>and <em>entire</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> to persevere to the end. But what he means by these two words, he afterwards explains of those who fail not, or become not wearied: for they, who being overcome as to patience, be broken down, must, by degrees, be necessarily weakened, and at length wholly fail. </p><p><strong>(100)</strong> “Perfect, <span class="lang el-gr">τέλειοι</span>,” fully grown, mature; “entire, <span class="lang el-gr">ὁλόχληζοι,</span> ” complete, no part wanting. The first refers to the maturity of grace; and the second to its completeness, no grace being wanting. They were to be like men full grown, and not maimed or mutilated, but having all their members complete. </p></div>
