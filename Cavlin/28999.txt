For this manner of expression — <em>the truth of Christ is in me, </em>is in the form of oath. Let me not be thought to have the <em>truth of Christ </em>in me if I do not retain this glorying among the inhabitants of Achaia. Now Corinth was in Achaia. <span class="cite-ref">(827)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(827)</span> “See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 37. </p></div></div>
