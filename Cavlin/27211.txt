<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong><em>Philip, opening his mouth. </em>To open the mouth is taken in Scripture for, to begin a long speech concerning some grave and weighty matter. Therefore Luke’s meaning is, that Philip began to intreat [discourse] of Christ, as it were, with full mouth. He saith that he began with this prophecy, because there is no one which depainteth out Christ more lively; <span class="cite-ref">(564)</span> and it was then brought <span class="cite-ref">(565)</span> to his hand. Therefore, after that Philip had showed, by the prophet’s words, after what sort Christ should come, and what was to be hoped for at his hands, he conferred the thing itself afterward, that the eunuch might know that that Christ which was promised was already revealed and given, and that he might understand his power. Where we translate it, that <em>he preached Christ, </em>Luke saith that he preached the gospel. The sense is, that he taught that of Christ which he uttered in his gospel himself, and commanded to be taught; whereby we gather, that when Christ is known, we have the sum of the gospel. </p><p><strong>(564)</strong> “Clarius,” more clearly. </p><p><strong>(565)</strong> “Commode,” conveniently, omitted. </p></div>
