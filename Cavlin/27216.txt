And whereas Luke saith expressly that he preached in all cities until he came to Cesarea, and doth not declare that he returned to Samaria, we may thereby conjecture that he staid at Cesarea for a time; and yet I leave this indifferent. </p><p><strong>(568)</strong> “Strenuitas,” strenuousness, activity. </p></div>
