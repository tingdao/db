<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And have no fellowship. </em>As “the children of light” dwell amidst the darkness, or, in other words, in the midst of “a perverse and crooked generation,” (<span class="bvs">Deu_32:5</span>,) — there is good reason for warning them to keep themselves apart from wicked actions. It is not enough that we do not, of our own accord, undertake anything wicked. We must beware of joining or assisting those who do wrong. In short, we must abstain from giving any consent, or advice, or approbation, or assistance; for in all these ways we <em>have fellowship. </em>And lest any one should imagine that he has done his duty, merely by not conniving, he adds, <em>but rather reprove them. </em><span class="cite-ref">(158)</span> Such a course is opposed to all dissimulation. Where a manifest offense is committed against God, every man will be eager to vindicate himself from any share in the guilt, but very few will guard against connivance; nearly all will practice some kind of dissimulation. But rather than the truth of God shall not remain unshaken, let a hundred worlds perish. </p><p>The word<span class="lang el-gr">ἐλέγχειν, </span> which is translated <em>reprove, </em>answers to the metaphor of darkness; for it literally signifies to drag forth to the light what was formerly unknown. As ungodly men flatter themselves in their vices, (<span class="bvs">Psa_36:2</span>,) and wish their crimes to be concealed, or to be reckoned virtues, Paul enjoins that they shall be <em>reproved. </em>He calls them <em>unfruitful; </em>because they not only do no good, but are absolutely hurtful. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(158)</span> “Most expositors supply <span class="lang el-gr">αὐτοὺς</span>, meaning the doers of the works; and they render <span class="lang el-gr">ἐλέγχετε</span>, <em>reprove, </em>viz., by wholesome correction. This, however, is so harsh, that it is better (with Theodoret, the Pesch. Syr., Wakefield, Schleusner, Photius, and Wahl) to supply <span class="lang el-gr">αὐτὰ</span>, that is, <span class="lang el-gr">ἔργα τοῦ σκότους</span>, and to interpret <span class="lang el-gr">ἐλέγχετε</span> ‘bring to the light, and evince their evil nature,’ namely, by shewing in contrast the opposite virtues. This sense is required by verse 13, with which the present closely connects; and so <span class="lang el-gr">ἐλέγχω</span> is used both in the Scriptural and Classical writers.” — Bloomfield. </p></div></div>
