<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>A faithful saying </em>He employs this mode of expression, when he wishes to make a solemn assertion as we have seen in both of the Epistles to Timothy. (<span class="bvs">1Ti_1:15</span>; <span class="bvs">2Ti_2:11</span>.) And therefore he immediately adds: — </p><p><em>I wish thee to affirm these things </em><span class="cite-ref">(263)</span><span class="lang el-gr">Διαβεβαιοῦσθαι </span> under a passive termination, has an active signification, and means “to affirm anything strongly.” Titus is therefore enjoined to disregard other matters, and to teach those which are certain and undoubted — to press them on the attention of their hearers — to dwell upon them — while others talk idly about things of little importance. Hence also, we conclude that a bishop must not make any assertions at random, but must assert those things only which he has ascertained to be true. “Affirm these things,” says he, “because they are true and worthy of credit.” But we are reminded, on the other hand, that it is the duty and office of a bishop to affirm strongly, and maintain boldly, those things which are believed on good grounds, and which edify godliness. </p><p><em>That they who have believed God may be careful to excel in good works, </em>(or, <em>to extol good works, </em>or, <em>to assign to them the highest rank.) </em>He includes all the instructions which he formerly gave concerning the duty of every person, and the desire of leading a religious and holy life; as if he contrasted the fear of God, and well-regulated conduct, with idle speculations. He wishes the people to be instructed in such a manner that “they who have believed God,” may be solicitous, above all things, about good works. </p><p>But, as the verb<span class="lang el-gr">προΐστασθαι </span> is used in various senses by Greek authors, this passage also gives scope for various interpretations. Chrysostom: explains it to mean, that they should endeavor to relieve their neighbors by giving alms<span class="lang el-gr">. Προΐστασθαι </span> does sometimes mean “to give assistance;” but in that case the syntax would require us to understand that the “good works” should be aided, which would be a harsh construction. The meaning conveyed by the French word <em class="lang fr-fr">avancer </em><em>, “ </em>to go forward,” would be more appropriate. What if we should say, — “Let them strive as those who have the pre-eminence?” That is also one meaning of the word. Or, perhaps, some one will prefer what I have enclosed in brackets: “Let them be careful to assign the highest rank to good works.” And certainly it would not be unsuitable that Paul should enjoin that those things should prevail in the life of believers, because they are usually disregarded by others. </p><p>Whatever may be the ambiguity of the expression, the meaning of Paul is sufficiently clear, that the design of Christian doctrine is, that believers should exercise themselves in good works. <span class="cite-ref">(264)</span> Thus he wishes them to give to it their study and application; and, when the Apostle says<span class="lang el-gr">, φροντίζωσι </span> (“let them be careful,”) he appears to allude elegantly to the useless contemplations of those who speculate without advantage, and without regard to active life. </p><p>Yet he is not so careful about good works as to despise the root — that is, faith — while he is gathering the fruits. He takes account of both parts, and, as is highly proper, assigns the first rank to faith; for he enjoins those “who believed in God” to be zealous of “good works;” by which he means that faith must go before in such a manner that good works may follow. </p><p><em>For these things are honorable </em>I refer this to the doctrine rather than to the works, in this sense: “It is excellent and useful that men be thus instructed; and, therefore, those things which he formerly exhorted Titus to be zealous in affirming are the same things that are good and useful tomen.” We might translate<span class="lang el-gr">τὰ καλά </span> either “good,” or “beautiful,” or “honorable;” but, in my opinion, it would be best to translate it “excellent.” He states indirectly that all other things that are taught are of no value, because they yield no profit or advantage; as, on the contrary, that which contributes to salvation is worthy of praise. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(263)</span> “Meaning, ‘and I would have you constantly insist on these truths; so that those who have believed in God may maintain good works.’ The cause of the obscurity, and consequent diversity of interpretation, arose from the Apostle not having here shewn <em>how </em>it should be, that the doctrine of salvation by grace should produce holiness of life. But he has done it in another kindred passage, namely, <span class="bvs">Eph_2:9</span>, where, after having at large treated on the subject of salvation by grace, (as here,) adding that it is not of works, lest any man should boast, he subjoins<span class="lang el-gr">, αὐτοῦ γάρ ἐσμεν, κ.τ.λ. </span> where the γὰρ refers to a clause omitted, q. d. (Yet works must be done,) for, etc. Hence it would seem that<span class="lang el-gr">καλῶν ἔργων </span> here must have the same sense as<span class="lang el-gr">ἔργοις ἀγαθοῖς </span> there; and consequently it must not be limited, with many eminent commentators, to works of benevolence, still less to the business of our avocation, but be extended to good works of every kind.” — <em>Bloomfield. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(264)</span> “The original word<span class="lang el-gr">προΐστασθαι </span> has a beauty and an energy, which, I believe, it is impossible for our language to preserve by any literal translation. It implies, that a believer should not only be exercised in, but eminent for, all good works; should shew others the way, and outstrip them in the honorable race; be both a pattern and a patron of universal godliness.” — <em>Hervey. </em></p></div></div>
