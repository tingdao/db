<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>41.</strong><em>The Jews therefore murmured concerning him. </em>The Evangelist explains the cause of the murmuring to have been, that the Jews were offended at the mean condition of Christ’s human nature, <span class="cite-ref">(150)</span> and did not perceive in him any thing Divine or heavenly. Yet he shows that they had a twofold obstruction. One they had framed for themselves out of a false opinion, when they said, <em>Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we hnow? </em>Another arose from a wicked sentiment, that they did not think that Christ was the Son of God, because he came down to men clothed with our flesh. <span class="cite-ref">(151)</span> But we are guilty of excessive malignity, if we despise the Lord of glory because on our account </p><p>he emptied himself, and took upon him the form of a servant, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>;) </p><p>for this was rather an illustrious proof of his boundless love towards us, and of his wonderful grace. Besides, the Divine majesty of Christ was not so concealed under the mean and contemptible appearance of the flesh, as not to give out the rays of his brightness in a variety of ways; but those gross and stupid men wanted eyes to see his conspicuous glory. </p><p>We, too, sin daily in both of these ways. First, it is a great hinderance to us, that it is only with carnal eyes that we behold Christ; and this is the reason why we perceive in him nothing magnificent, for by our sinful views we pervert all that belongs to him and to his doctrine, so unskilful are we to profit by them, or to view them in the proper light. <span class="cite-ref">(152)</span> Secondly, not satisfied with this, we adopt many false imaginations, which produce a contempt of the Gospel. Nay, there are even many who frame for themselves monsters, that they may make them a pretense for hating the Gospel. In this manner the world deliberately drives away the grace of God. Now the Evangelist expressly names the Jews, in order to inform us that the <em>murmuring </em>proceeded from those who gloried in the title of faith and of the Church, that we may all learn to receive Christ with reverence, when he <em>comes down to us</em>, and that, in proportion as he comes nearer to us, we may more cheerfully approach to him, that he may raise us to his heavenly glory. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(150)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De la petitesse de Christ, et de sa humaine condition</span>;” — “at the meanness of Christ, and of his human condition.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(151)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Prenant nostre chair</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(152)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tant nous sommes mal adroits a faire nostre profit des choses, et les prendre de la sorte qu’il faut</span>.” </p></div></div>
