<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13</strong><em>Consume, consume them in wrath, that they may not be </em>David may seem to contradict himself in praying for the utter destruction of his enemies, when immediately before he had expressed his desire that they might not be exterminated at once. <span class="cite-ref">(374)</span> What else could he mean when he asks that God would consume them in wrath, but that he would cut them off suddenly, and not by a gradual and slower process of punishment? But he evidently refers in what he says here to a different point of time, and this removes any apparent inconsistency, for he prays that when they had been set up for a sufficient period as an example, they might eventually be devoted to destruction. It was customary with the victorious Roman generals, first to lead the captives which had been kept for the day of triumph through the city, and afterwards, upon reaching the capital, to give them over to the lictors for execution. Now David prays that when God had, in a similar manner, reserved his enemies for an interval sufficient to illustrate his triumph, he would upon this consign them to summary punishment. The two things are not at all inconsistent; first, that the divine judgments should be lengthened out through a considerable period, to secure their being remembered better, and that then, upon sufficient evidence being given to the world of the certainty with which the wicked are subjected in the displeasure of God to the slower process of destruction, he should in due time bring them forth to final execution, the better to awake, by such a demonstration of his power, the minds of those who may be more secure than others, or less affected by witnessing moderate inflictions of punishment. He adds, accordingly, <em>that they may know, even to the ends of the earth, that God ruleth in Jacob </em>Some would insert the copulative particle, reading, <em>that they may know that God rules in Jacob, and in all the nations of the world, </em>an interpretation which I do not approve, and which does violence to the sense. The allusion is to the condign nature of the judgment, which would be such that the report of it would reach the remotest regions, and strike salutary terror into the minds even of their benighted and godless inhabitants. He was more especially anxious that God should be recognised as ruling <em>in the Church, </em>it being preposterous that the place where his throne was erected should present such an aspect of confusion as converted his temple into a den of thieves. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(374)</span> Williams observes, that the Hebrew rendered <em>consume </em>“literally means <em>to finish</em>, bring to an end; namely, the (lang. it) <em>banditti </em>. The Psalmist, verse 11, prays, ‘Slay them not;’<em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , take not away their lives as individuals, but put an end to the conspiracy.” </p></div></div>
