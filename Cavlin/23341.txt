<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_7:24</span><strong>.</strong><em>Every one, therefore, who heareth </em>As it is often difficult to distinguish the true professors of the Gospel from the false, Christ shows, by a beautiful comparison, where the main difference lies. He represents two houses, one of which was built without a foundation, while the other was well-founded. Both have the same external appearance: but, when the wind and storms blow, and the floods dash against them, the former will immediately fall, while the latter will be sustained by its strength against every assault. Christ therefore compares a vain and empty profession of the Gospel to a beautiful, but not solid, building, which, however elevated, is exposed every moment to downfall, because it wants a foundation. Accordingly, Paul enjoins us to be well and thoroughly founded on Christ, and to have deep roots, (<span class="bvs">Col_2:7</span>,) </p><p>“that we may not be tossed and driven about by every wind of doctrine,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Eph_4:14</span>) </p><p>that we may not give way at every attack. The general meaning of the passage is, that true piety is not fully distinguished from its counterfeit, <span class="cite-ref">(485)</span> till it comes to the trial. For the temptations, by which we are tried, are like billows and storms, which easily overwhelm unsteady minds, whose lightness is not perceived during the season of prosperity. </p><p><em>Who heareth these sayings </em>The relative <em>these </em>denotes not one class of sayings, but the whole amount of doctrine. He means, that the Gospel, if it be not deeply rooted in the mind, is like a wall, which has been raised to a great height, but does not rest on any foundation. “That faith (he says) is true, which has its roots deep in the heart, and rests on an earnest and steady affection as its foundation, that it may not give way to temptations.” For such is the vanity of the human mind, that all build upon the sand, who do not dig so deep as to deny themselves. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(485)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu'on ne peut pas bien discerner la vraye crainte de Dieu, d'avecques une feintise et vaine apparence d’ icelle</span>;” — “that the true fear of God cannot be well distinguished from a dissembling and vain appearance of it.” </p></div></div>
