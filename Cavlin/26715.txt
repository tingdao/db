<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>You have not chosen me. </em>He declares still more clearly that it must not be ascribed to their own merit, but to his grace, that they have arrived at so great an honor; for when he says that <em>he was not chosen by them</em>, it is as if he had said, that whatever they have they did not obtain by their own skill or industry. Men commonly imagine some kind of concurrence to take place between the grace of God and the will of man; but that contrast, <em>I chose you</em>, <em>I was not chosen by you</em>, claims, exclusively, for Christ alone what is usually divided between Christ and man; as if he had said, that a man is not moved of his own accord to seek Christ, until he has been sought by him. </p><p>True, the subject now in hand is not the ordinary <em>election </em>of believers, by which they are adopted to be the children of God, but that special <em>election</em>, by which he set apart his disciples to the office of preaching the Gospel. But if it was by free gift, and not by their own merit, that they were <em>chosen </em>to the apostolic office, much more is it certain that the <em>election</em>, by which, from being the children of wrath and an accursed seed, we become the children of God, is of free grace. Besides, in this passage Christ magnifies his grace, by which they had been <em>chosen </em>to be Apostles, so as to join with it that former election by which they had been engrafted into the body of the Church; or rather, he includes in these words all the dignity and honor which he had conferred on them. Yet I acknowledge that Christ treats expressly of the apostleship; for his design is, to excite the disciples to execute their office diligently and faithfully. <span class="cite-ref">(85)</span></p><p>He takes, as the ground of his exhortation, the undeserved favor which he had bestowed on them; for the greater our obligations to the Lord, the more earnest ought we to be in performing the duties which he demands from us; otherwise it will be impossible for us to avoid the charge of base ingratitude. Hence it appears that there is nothing which ought more powerfully to kindle in us the desire of a holy and religious life, than when we acknowledge that we owe every thing to God, and that we have nothing that is our own; that both the commencement of our salvation, and all the parts which follow from it, flow from his undeserved mercy. Besides, how true this statement of Christ is, may be clearly perceived from the fact, that Christ <em>chose </em>to be his apostles those who might have been thought to be the most unfit of all for the office; though in their person he intended to preserve an enduring monument of his grace. For, as Paul says, (<span class="bvs">1Co_2:16</span>,) who among men shall be found fit for discharging the embassy by which God reconciles mankind to himself? Or rather, what mortal is able to represent the person of God? It is Christ alone who makes them fit by his election. Thus Paul ascribes his <em>apostleship </em>to <em>grace</em>, (<span class="bvs">Rom_1:5</span>,) and again mentions that </p><p>he had been separated from his mother’s womb, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Gal_1:15</span>.) </p><p>Nay more, since we are altogether useless servants, those who appear to be the most excellent of all will not be fit for the smallest calling, till they have been <em>chosen</em>. Yet the higher the degree of honor to which any one has been raised, let him remember that he is under the deeper obligations to God. </p><p><em>And I have appointed you. </em>The election is hidden till it is actually made known, when a man receives an office to which he had been appointed; as Paul, in the passage which I quoted a little ago, where he says that <em>he had been separated from his mother </em>’<em>s womb</em>, adds, that he was created an apostle, because <em>it so pleased God </em>His words are: </p><p>When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Gal_1:15</span>.) </p><p>Thus also the Lord testifies that he <em>knew </em>Jeremiah <em>before he was in his mother </em>’<em>s womb</em>, (<span class="bvs">Jer_1:5</span>,) though he calls him to the prophetical office at the proper and appointed time. It may happen, no doubt, that one who is duly qualified enters into the office of teaching; or rather, it usually happens in the Church that no one is called till he be endued and furnished with the necessary qualifications. That Christ declares himself to be the Author of both is not wonderful; since it is only by him that God acts, and he acts along with the Father. So then, both election and ordination belong equally to both. </p><p><em>That you may go. </em>He now points out the reason why he mentioned his grace. It was, to make them apply more earnestly to the work. The apostleship was not a place of honor without toil, but they had to contend with very great difficulties; and therefore Christ encourages them not to shrink from labors, and annoyances, and dangers. This argument is drawn from the end which they ought to have in view; but Christ reasons from the effect, when he says, </p><p><em>That you may bear fruit; </em>for it is hardly possible that any one would devote himself earnestly and diligently to the work, if he did not expect that the labor would bring some advantage. Christ, therefore, declares that their efforts will not be useless or unsuccessful, provided that they are ready to obey and follow when he calls them. <span class="cite-ref">(86)</span> For he not only enjoins on the apostles what their calling involves and demands, but promises to them also prosperity and success, that they may not be cold or indifferent. It is hardly possible to tell how great is the value of this consolation against those numerous temptations which daily befall the ministers of Christ. Whenever, then, we see that we are losing our pains, let us call to remembrance that Christ will, at length, prevent our exertions from being vain or unproductive; for the chief accomplishment of this promise is at the very time when there is no appearance of <em>fruit. </em>Scorners, and those whom the world looks upon as wise men, ridicule our attempts as foolish, and tell us that it is in vain for us to attempt to mingle heaven and earth; because the <em>fruit </em>does not yet correspond to our wishes. But since Christ, on the contrary, has promised that the happy result, though concealed for a time, will follow, let us labor diligently in the discharge of our duty amidst the mockeries of the world. </p><p><em>And that your fruit may abide. </em>A question now arises, why does Christ say that this <em>fruit </em>will be perpetual? As the doctrine of the Gospel obtains souls to Christ for eternal salvation, many think that this is the perpetuity of <em>the fruit </em>But I extend the statement much farther, as meaning that the Church will last to the very end of the world; for the labor of the apostles yields <em>fruit </em>even in the present day, and our preaching is not for a single age only, but will enlarge the Church, so that new <em>fruit </em>will be seen to spring up after our death. </p><p>When he says, <em>your fruit</em>, he speaks as if it had been obtained by their own industry, though Paul teaches that <em>they who plant or water are nothing</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Co_3:7</span>.) And, indeed, the formation of the Church is so excellent a work of God, that the glory of it ought not to be ascribed to men. But as the Lord displays his power by the agency of men, that they may not labor in vain, he is wont to transfer to them even that which belongs peculiarly to himself. Yet let us remember that, when he so graciously commends his disciples, it is to encourage, and not to puff them up. </p><p><em>That your Father may give you all that you ask in my name. </em>This clause was not added abruptly, as many might suppose; for, since the office of teaching far exceeds the power of men, there are added to it innumerable attacks of Satan, which never could be warded off but by the power of God. That the apostles may not be discouraged, Christ meets them with the most valuable aid; as if he had said, “If the work assigned to you be so great that you are unable to fulfill the duties of your office, my Father will not forsake you; for I have appointed you to be ministers of the Gospel on this condition, that my Father will have his hand stretched out to assist you, whenever you pray to him, <em>in my name</em>, to grant you assistance.” And, indeed, that the greater part of teachers either languish through indolence, or utterly give way through despair, arises from nothing else than that they are sluggish in the duty of prayer. </p><p>This promise of Christ, therefore, arouses us to call upon God; for whoever acknowledges that the success of his work depends on God alone, will offer his labor to him with fear and trembling. On the other hand, if any one, relying on his own industry, disregard the assistance of God, he will either throw away his spear and shield, when he comes to the trial, or he will be busily employed, but without any advantage. Now, we must here guard against two faults, pride and distrust; for, as the assistance of God is fearlessly disregarded by those who think that the matter is already in their own power, so many yield to difficulties, because they do not consider that they fight through the power and protection of God, under whose banner they go forth to war. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(85)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Diligemment et fidelement</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(86)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A obeir et suyvre ou il les appellcra</span>.” </p></div></div>
