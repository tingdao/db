<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And being moved with envy. </em>We see how Paul could nowhere erect the kingdom of Christ without some conflict, for so soon as any fruit of doctrine appeared, there arose persecution therewithal; but because he knew that he was to war against Satan and the wickedness of the world, he was not only hardened against all assaults, but he was more encouraged more courageously to proceed. Therefore, all the servants of Christ must be content with this one example of him, if they see that their labor doth yield some fruit, they must recompense all manner of persecutions with this reward. And this place teacheth that the zeal wherewith the unbelievers are carried headlong, and set on fire, is nothing else but furious force,<span class="cite-ref">(250)</span> because it is not governed by the prudence of the Spirit, neither yet with righteousness or equity. And though they do always pretend the name of God for an excuse of their disordered zeal, yet this history doth plainly declare, that mere hypocrisy doth reign inwardly, and that all corners of their hearts are stuffed with poisoned malice. These enemies of Paul did boast that they were defenders of the law of God; and that they did hate Paul, and contend with him only in defense thereof.</p><p>Why do they then arm the wicked, and conspire together with them to raise tumult? Why then do they also before a profane magistrate bring the gospel in that contempt which might have redounded to the contempt of the law? Such sedition doth plainly declare, that they were moved with nothing less than desire to please God, to be thus hot against Paul, for to what end do they beset Jason’s house, and strive disorderly<span class="cite-ref">(251)</span> to pluck out Paul thence, save only that they may set him before the people to be stoned? Therefore, let us know that wicked zeal, which is hot [boils] in superstitious men, is always infected with hypocrisy and malice; and this is the cause that it breaketh out into cruelty without keeping any measure.</p><p><em>Taking to them certain vagabonds. </em>The Greek word which Luke useth doth signify sluggards, and men whereof there ought no account to be made, who, having nothing wherewith they could keep themselves occupied at home, did run up and down idle;<span class="cite-ref">(252)</span> or bold [audacious] fellows and hungry, who are ready to forswear themselves to raise tumults, and to be at one end of<span class="cite-ref">(253)</span> every wicked fact. Whereby it doth likewise appear that their own conscience told them that they did amiss, seeing they got wicked men to take their part, and to give them their consent. For seeing the magistrate did favor them, what did move them to raise that tempest, save only because they had no hope to have any success, unless (matters should be out of order and) all should be in an uproar? And Luke describeth how such fans did raise sedition; to wit, they gathered the people together in troops, and spread abroad their poison here and there, until they were strong enough to make an assault;<span class="cite-ref">(254)</span> which policy [artifice] is too common among seditions fellows, as those cities which are subject to this mischief do full well know.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(250)</span></p><p>“ Rabiosum... impetum,” a rabid impulse. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(251)</span></p><p>“ Tumultuose,” tumtultuously. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(252)</span></p><p>“ Per forum,” through the market-place. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(253)</span></p><p>“ Operam suam locare,” hire out their assistance in. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(254)</span></p><p>“ Donec ad vim inferendam sufficerent,” until they were able to offer violence. </p></div></div>
