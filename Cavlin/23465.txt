<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>The poor receive the message of the Gospel </em>By <em>the poor </em>are undoubtedly meant those whose condition is wretched and despicable, and who are held in no estimation. However mean any person may be, his poverty is so far from being a ground of despair, that it ought rather to animate him with courage to seek Christ. But let us remember that none are accounted <em>poor </em>but those who are really such, or, in other words, who lie low and overwhelmed by a conviction of their poverty. </p></div>
