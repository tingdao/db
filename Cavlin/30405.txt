<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>Wherefore also it is contained in Scripture; </em>or, <em>Wherefore also the Scripture contains </em><span class="cite-ref">(20)</span> They who refer the verb “contain” (<span class="lang el-gr">περιέχειν</span>) to Christ, and render it “embrace,” because through him all these unite together, wholly depart from the meaning of the Apostle. No better is another exposition, that Christ excels others; for Peter simply intended to quote the testimony of Scripture. <span class="cite-ref">(21)</span> He then shews what had been taught by the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures, or, which is the same thing, that what he adds is contained in them. Nor is it an unsuitable confirmation of the preceding verse. For we see for what slight reasons, and almost for none, many reject Christ, and some fall away from him; but this is a stumblingblock which above all other things stands in the way of some; they are drawn away, because not only the common people despise and reject Christ, but also those who are high in dignity and honor, and seem to excel others. This evil has almost ever prevailed in the world, and at this day it prevails much; for a great part of mankind judge of Christ according to the false opinion of the world. Moreover, such is the ingratitude and impiety of men, that Christ is everywhere despised. Thus it is, that while they regard one another, few pay him his due honor. Hence Peter reminds us of what had been foretold of Christ, lest the contempt or the rejection of him should move us from the faith. </p><p>Now, the first passage, which he adduces, is taken from <span class="bvs">Isa_28:16</span>; where the Prophet, after having inveighed against the desperate wickedness of his own nation, at length adds, </p><p>“Your perfidy shall not prevent God from restoring his church, which now through you lies wholly in a ruinous state.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_28:16</span>) </p><p>The manner of restoration he thus describes, “I will lay in Sion a stone.” We hence learn that there is no building up of the Church without Christ; for there is no other foundation but he, as Paul testifies, (<span class="bvs">1Co_3:11</span>.) This is no matter of wonder, for all our salvation is found only in him. Whosoever, then, turns away from him in the least degree, will find his foundation a precipice. </p><p>Therefore the Prophet not only calls him a corner-stone, which connects the whole edifice, but also a stone of trial, according to which the building is to be measured and regulated; and farther, he calls him a solid foundation, which sustains the whole edifice. He is thus, then, a corner-stone, that he might be the rule of the building, as well as the only foundation. But Peter took from the words of the Prophet what was especially suitable to his argument, even that he was a chosen stone, and in the highest degree valuable and excellent, and also that on him we ought to build. This honor is ascribed to Christ, that how much soever he may be despised by the world, he may not be despised by us; for by God he is regarded as very precious. But when he calls him a corner-stone, he intimates that those have no concern for their salvation who do not recumb on Christ. What some have refined on the word “corner,” as though it meant that Christ joins together Jews and Gentiles, as two distinct walls, is not well founded. Let us, then, be content with a simple explanation, that he is so called, because the weight of the building rests on him. </p><p>We must further observe, that the Prophet introduces God as the speaker, for he alone forms and plans his own Church, as it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_78:69</span>, that his hand had founded Sion. He, indeed, employs the labor and ministry of men in building it; but this is not inconsistent with the truth that it is his own work. Christ, then, is the foundation of our salvation, because he has been ordained for this end by the Father. </p><p>And he says <em>in Sion, </em>because there God’s spiritual temple was to have its beginning. That our faith, therefore, may firmly rest on Christ, we must come to the Law and to the Prophets. For though this stone extends to the extreme parts of the world, it was yet necessary for it to be located first in Sion, for there at that time was the seat of the Church. But it is said to have been then set, when the Father revealed him for the purpose of restoring his Church. In short, we must hold this, that those only rest on Christ, who keep the unity of the Church, for he is not set as a foundation-stone except in Sion. As from Sion the Church went forth, which is now everywhere spread, so also from Sion our faith has derived its beginning, as Isaiah says, </p><p>“From Sion shall go forth the law,<LineBreak />and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_2:3</span>.) </p><p>Corresponding with this is what is said in the Psalms, </p><p>“The scepter of thy power will the Lord send forth from Sion.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_110:2</span>.) </p><p><em>He that believeth </em>The Prophet does not say <em>in him, </em>but declares generally, “He that believeth shall not make haste.” As, however, there is no doubt but that God sets forth Christ there as the object of our faith, the faith of which the Prophet speaks must look on him alone. And, doubtless, no one can rightly believe, but he who is fully convinced that in Christ he ought wholly to trust. </p><p>But the words of the Prophet may be taken in two ways, either as a promise or as an exhortation. The future time is referred to, “He shall not make haste;” but in Hebrew the future is often to be taken for an imperative, “Let him not make haste.” Thus the meaning would be, “Be ye not moved in your minds, but quietly entertain your desires, and check your feelings, until the Lord will be pleased to fulfill his promise.” So he says in another place, </p><p>“In silence and in quietness shall be your strength,”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_30:15</span>.) </p><p>But as the other reading seems to come nearer to Peter’s interpretation, I give it the preference. Then the sense would not be unsuitable, “He who believeth shall not waver” or vacillate; for he has a firm and permanent foundation. And it is a valuable truth, that relying on Christ, we are beyond the danger of falling. Moreover, to be ashamed (<em>pudefieri </em>) means the same thing. Peter has retained the real sense of the Prophet, though he has followed the Greek version. <span class="cite-ref">(22)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(20)</span> Several copies have <span class="lang el-gr">ἡ γραφὴ</span> instead of <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν τὣ γραφὴ</span>; and this reading <em>Calvin </em>has followed.

Indeed, the difference between <span class="lang he-il">יחיש</span> he shall make haste, and <span class="lang he-il">יבש</span>, he shall be ashamed, is very small; and further, the former verb admits of a similar meaning with the latter. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
