<div class="comment-content"><p>He confirms the same truth, but a metaphor is introduced: for he says, that when he freed himself from the office of a shepherd, he broke the two rods, even <em>Beauty </em>and <em>Gathering</em>. He speaks of the first staff, because things were in a confusion in Judea, before the people were wholly cut off; for the dispersion did not immediately take place, so that there was no sort of social state among the Jews; but social order was so deranged, that it was sufficiently evident that they were not ruled by God. By degrees the purity of doctrine was corrupted, and a flood of errors crept in; superstition gained great strength. When things were in this state of confusion, the pastoral staff was broken, which is called, Beauty. This verse then contains no more than an explanation of the last: and hence also he says, <em>That broken might be the covenant which I had made</em>, that is, that it might be now quite evident that this people are not ruled by my hand and authority. </p><p>Some interpreters extend to the whole world what is here said of nations, and think that the same thing is meant by Zechariah as that which is said in <span class="bvs">Hos_2:1</span>, -that the Lord made a covenant with the beasts of the earth and the birds of heaven, that no harm should happen to his people; but the comparison is not suitable. It is then probable, that God here speaks only of the posterity of Abraham; nor is it to be wondered at that they are called nations, for even so Moses says, </p><p>“Nations from thee shall be born,” (<span class="bvs">Gen_17:6</span>.) </p><p>and this was done for the purpose of setting forth the greatness of God’s favor; for the ten tribes were as so many nations among whom God reigned. It seemed incredible, that from one man, not only a numerous family, but many nations should proceed. The real meaning then seems to be, that God testified that he would no longer be the leader of that people; for when order was trodden under foot, the covenant of God was made void. Why indeed was that covenant continued, and what was its design, except to keep things aright, in a fit and suitable condition? Thus in the church, God regards order, so that nothing should be done rashly, according to every man’s humor. This then was the beginning of that dispersion, which at length followed when the people had fallen off from the order which God had appointed. <span class="cite-ref">(141)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(141)</span> “All the nations” are considered to be the heathen nations by <em>Michaelis</em>, <em>Newcome</em>, and <em>Henderson</em>; but the meaning in this case is very obscure. Though the word here used, “peoples,” or nations, commonly designates the Gentile world, yet there are instances in which it is applied to the tribes of Israel. See <span class="bvs">1Kg_22:28</span>; <span class="bvs">Joe_2:6</span><em>Blayney </em>proposes to connect “all nations” with “cut asunder,” and renders [<span class="lang he-il">אם</span> ], “before,” “and cut it asunder, to break the covenant which I had made, before all the nations:” but interviewing clauses of this kind are quite foreign to the character of the Hebrew language. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
