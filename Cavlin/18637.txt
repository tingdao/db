<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>There is no peace, saith Jehovah to the wicked. </em>These words, “saith the Lord,” are included by some commentators in a parenthesis; but we view them as having this connection with what goes before, that the Lord denies to wicked men that “peace” of which they are unworthy. <span class="cite-ref">(242)</span> And this is expressly added, that hypocrites might not, according to their custom, cherish false confidence in these promises; for he declares that the promises do not belong to them, in order to shut them out altogether from the hope of salvation. But Isaiah appears also to have had his eye on something else; for, since the greater part of the people, under the influence of impiety, rejected this blessing, many weak and feeble persons might hesitate and might be terrified by the opinion of the multitude; <span class="cite-ref">(243)</span> as in our own day we see feeble consciences disturbed, when they see the greater part of men despise the doctrine of salvation. Beholding many persons placed in danger, he tums away their minds from such a temptation, that they may not be troubled by the multitude of wicked and unbelieving men, who reject the grace of God and this prosperous condition, but that, without paying any regard to those men, they may embrace and enjoy this benefit. </p><p><strong>(242)</strong> Our author means that, instead of reading the words thus, “There is no peace to the wicked, saith Jehovah,” he prefers to read them, “Jehovah saith to the wicked, There is no peace.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(243)</strong> “These words relate to those Jews who, being obstinately devoted to idolatry, and having settled down in Babylon, chose to remain there rather than to return to their native country and the religious worship of Jehovah. He declares, therefore, that such persons shall not have the happiness that is promised to those who shall return to their native habitations.” —<em>Rosenmuller. </em></p></div>
