For as Antichrist cannot stand otherwise than through the impostures of Satan, he must necessarily vanish as soon as Christ shines forth. In fine, as it is only in darkness that he reigns, the dawn of the day puts to flight and extinguishes the thick darkness of his reign. We are now in possession of Paul’s design, for he meant to say, that Christ would have no difficulty in destroying the tyranny of Antichrist, which was supported by no resources but those of Satan. In the mean time, however, he points out the marks by which that <em>wicked one </em>may be distinguished. For after having spoken of the <em>working </em>or <em>efficacy </em>of Satan, he marks it out particularly when he says, <em>in signs and lying wonders, and in all deceivableness</em>. And assuredly, in order that this may be opposed to the kingdom of Christ, it must consist partly in false doctrine and errors, and partly in pretended miracles. For the kingdom of Christ consists of the doctrine of truth, and the power of the Spirit. Satan, accordingly, with the view of opposing Christ in the person of his Vicar, puts on Christ’s mask, <span class="cite-ref">(670)</span> while he, nevertheless, at the same time chooses armor, with which he may directly oppose Christ. Christ, by the doctrine of his gospel, enlightens our minds in eternal life; Antichrist, trained up under Satan’s tuition, by wicked doctrine, involves the wicked in ruin; <span class="cite-ref">(671)</span> Christ puts forth the power of his Spirit for salvation, and seals his gospel by miracles; the adversary, <span class="cite-ref">(672)</span> by the efficacy of Satan, alienates us from the Holy Spirit, and by his enchantments confirms miserable men <span class="cite-ref">(673)</span> in error. </p><p>He gives the name of <em>miracles of falsehood</em>, not merely to such as are falsely and deceptively contrived by cunning men with a view to impose upon the simple — a kind of deception with which all Papacy abounds, for they are a part of his power which he has previously touched upon; but takes falsehood as consisting in this, that Satan draws to a contrary end works which otherwise are truly works of God, and abuses miracles so as to obscure God’s glory. <span class="cite-ref">(674)</span> In the mean time, however, there can be no doubt, that he deceives by means of enchantments—an example of which we have in Pharaoh’s magicians. (<span class="bvs">Exo_7:11</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(670)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et s’en desguise</span>;” — “And disguises himself with it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(671)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En ruine et perdition eternelle</span>;” — “In eternal ruin and perdition.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(672)</span> Our author evidently means Antichrist, alluding to the term applied to him by Paul in the 4<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse.—<em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(673)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les poures aveugles</span>;” — “The poor blind.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(674)</span> It is observed by Dr. Manton, in his Sermons on 2d Thess. that “there are seven points in Popery that are sought to be confirmed by Miracles.—1.
