For he might have comprehended in a few words all that he had said in the last chapter and also in this; but it was difficult to convince men of what he taught — it was therefore necessary to dwell at large on the subject. </p><p>He says now that the <em>cities </em>of Babylon, that is, of that monarchy, would <em>become a desolation. </em>He seems to have hitherto directed his threatenings against the city itself; but now he declares that God’s vengeance would extend to all the cities under the power of the Chaldean nation; and he speaks at large of their desolation, for he says that it would be a <em>land of desert, a land of drought, </em>or of filthiness, so that <em>no one would dwell in it. </em>And though he uses the singular number and repeats it, yet he refers to cities, <em>Pass through it shall no man, dwell in it shall no man </em><span class="cite-ref">(102)</span> He indeed speaks of the whole land, but so that he properly refers to the cities, as though he had said, that so great would be the destruction, that however far and wide the monarchy of Babylon extended, all its cities would be cut off. It afterwards follows, — </p><p><strong>(102)</strong> The <em>Sept</em>. and the <em>Syr</em>. remove the incongruity that is in this verse; they supply <span class="lang he-il">כ</span> before the “land” that occurs first, and omit the second “land.” Then the verse would read thus, — </p><p><strong>43.</strong>Become have her cities a desolation, Like a land of drought and a wilderness; Dwell in them shall no man, And pass through them shall no son of man. </p><p>The second “land” is omitted in two MSS.; and one has “in her,” instead of “in them.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
