<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>62.</strong><em>And he shut up his people to the sword. </em>Other parts of the calamity which befell Israel in the time of the high priest Eli are here mentioned. God, in permitting the ark to be carried away, showed that he had withdrawn his favor from them. This was also demonstrated from the fact, that all the flower of the people — those who were in the prime and blush of manhood — were consumed by the wrath of God: which is expressed by <em>the fire devouring them. </em>But this language is metaphorical, as is evident from the history of the event referred to, which informs us, that those that perished who were of the chosen of Israel, to the number of thirty thousand men, fell by the sword of the enemy, and not by fire, (<span class="bvs">1Sa_4:10</span>.) This figure points out the suddenness of the dreadful calamity. It is as if it had been said, They were destroyed in a moment, even as fire quickly consumes chaff and the dry leaves of trees. <span class="cite-ref">(361)</span></p><p>The great extent of this slaughter is heightened by another figure, which is, that for want of men, the maidens continued unmarried. This is the meaning of the clause, <em>Their virgins were not applauded; </em>the reference being to the nuptial songs which were wont to be sung at marriages in praise of the bride. To aggravate still more the unwonted and appalling nature of the calamity, it is added, that even <em>the priests, </em>whom God had taken under his special protection, perished indiscriminately with others. When it is said, that <em>the widows made no lamentation, </em>I would explain it as denoting, either that they themselves died first for sorrow, so that they had no opportunity of mourning for others, or else, that when led captive by their enemies, they were prohibited to mourn. By all these expressions, the object is to show, in a few words, that all kinds of calamities were heaped upon them. <span class="cite-ref">(362)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(361)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que c’en a este fait en un moment, ainsi que le feu a incontinent consume de la paille ou des fueilles d’arbres bieu seiches</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(362)</span> That is, the order of enumerating first the judgments inflicted by God upon his own people, and then those inflicted upon their enemies. </p></div></div>
