<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Jesus of Nazareth </em>Now doth Peter apply unto his purpose the prophecy of Joel; namely, that the Jews may thereby know that the time of restoring was present; and that Christ was given them for this purpose. For this promise was no otherwise to be fulfilled, save only by the coming of the Mediator. And this is the right use of all those gifts which we have by Christ, whilst that they bring us unto Christ, as unto a fountain. But he cometh hither by little and little. For he doth not by and by in the beginning affirm that Jesus was Christ; but he saith only that he was a man sent of God; and that doth he prove by his miracles. Afterward he addeth, that he rose from death when he was slain. Whereby it appeareth more certainly and more fully that he was not one of the prophets, but the very Son of God, who was promised to be the repairer of all things. Let this, therefore, be the first member, that Jesus of Nazareth was a man approved of God by manifest testimonies, so that he could not be despised as some base and obscure person. The old interpreter did not evil <span class="cite-ref">(99)</span> translate <span class="lang el-gr">ὑποδεδειγμενον</span><em>approved. </em>And Erasmus is deceived, who thinketh that he did read it otherwise; and he himself did not express Luke’s mind, when as he translated it given. <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> For, seeing that word doth signify among the Grecians <em>to show, </em>whereupon the mathematicians also call those arguments whereby they set a thing, as it were, before a man’s eyes, <span class="lang el-gr">αποδειξεις</span>, or <em>demonstrations, </em>Luke meant to say, that Jesus came not unknown, and without any testimony or approbation, but that those miracles which God showed by him served to this end, that he might be famous and excellent. Therefore he saith that he was showed toward the Jews; because God would have his Son to be accounted excellent and great among them; as if he should say, that miracles were not appointed for other nations, but for the Jews, that they might know that Jesus was sent unto them of God. </p><p><em>By great works. </em>He calleth miracles by these three names. And because God doth show forth his power in them after a new and unwonted sort, or doth, at least, procure greater admiration, they are, for good causes, called <em>great works. </em><span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> For we are commonly more moved when any extraordinary thing doth happen. In which respect they are also called <em>wonders, </em><span class="cite-ref">(102)</span> because they make us astonished. And for this cause are they called <em>signs, </em>because the Lord will not have men’s minds to stay there, but to be lifted up higher; as they are referred unto another end. He put in three words, to the end he might the more extol Christ’s miracles, and enforce the people, by his heaping and laying of words together, to consider the same. Furthermore, he maketh not Christ the chief author, but only the minister; because, as we have already said, he determined to go forward by degrees. Notwithstanding, here may a question be asked, whether miracles do suffice to be a sufficient and just approbation [proof] or no? Because by this means inchanters might cause their legerdemain <span class="cite-ref">(103)</span> to be believed. I answer, that the juggling casts of Satan do much differ from the power of God. Christ saith elsewhere, that the kingdom of Antichrist shall be in wonders, but he addeth by and by, <em>in lying wonders, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Th_2:9</span>.) if any man object, that we cannot easily discern, because he saith that they shall have so great color that they shall deceive (if it could be) the very elect; I answer again, that this error proceedeth only from our own want of wit, because we are so dull; for God doth show his power manifestly enough. Therefore, there is sufficient approbation of the doctrine and of the ministry in the miracles which God doth work, so that we be not blind. And whereas it is not of sufficient force among the wicked, because they may now and then be deceived with the false miracles of Satan, this must be imputed unto their own blindness; but whosoever hath a pure heart, he doth also know God with the pure eyes of his mind, so often as he doth show himself. Neither can Satan otherwise delude us, save only when, through the wickedness of our heart, our judgment is corrupt and our eyes blinded, or at least bleared through our own slothfulness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(99)</span> “Male,” ill, improperly. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(100)</span> “Exhibitum,” exhibited. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span> “Virtutes.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(102)</span> “Prodigia,” prodigies. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(103)</span> “Suis imposturis fidem facerent magi,” magians might procure credit for their impostures. </p></div></div>
