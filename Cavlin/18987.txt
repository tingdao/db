<div class="comment-content"><p>God here confirms what is said in the last verse; for he condemned the Israelites for having perversely run here and there after their superstitions, when yet they had been redeemed for this end, — that they might be ruled by the hand of God. Hence he says, <em>I planted thee as a choice vine; </em>that is, “When I redeemed thee from thine enemies, I did not give thee permission thus to prostitute thyself without any restraint, without any shame; for I planted thee as a choice vine.” </p><p>The metaphor is well known, and often occurs; for God frequently compares his Church to a vine. He calls it generally his heritage, or his land; but as vines excel other possessions, (for they are usually preferred to pasture lands, or to cultivated fields,) as then vines are the most valuable property, God hereby testifies how highly he values his Church; for he calls it his vine rather than his pasture or his field, when he speaks of it. So he does in this place, “I did not deliver thee from Egypt, that I might afterwards throw aside every care of thee; but my purpose was, that thou shouldest strike roots, and become an heritage precious to me, as an exquisite and a noble vine. I, therefore, <em>planted thee a generous vine, </em><span class="lang he-il">שורק</span><em>shur </em>e<em>k, </em>that thou mightest bring me forth fruit.” </p><p>Then he says, <em>a wholly right seed; </em><span class="cite-ref">(50)</span> that is, “I planted thee for this end, — that thou mightest produce fruit acceptable and pleasant to me.” God regards here his own grace, and not the character of the people; for that people, as it is well known, was never a true seed: but God here shews the purpose for which he had redeemed the people, which was, that they might be like a choice vine. <em>How then? </em>he adds. God speaks here of their corruptions with wonder, for the indignity was such as was enough to astonish all men: <em>how then art thou turned to me into degenerations! </em>So I render <span class="lang he-il">סורום</span><em>surim, </em>though the word is not in common use in Latin: but it is enough for me if we understand the meaning of the Prophet. The word is derived from <span class="lang he-il">סור</span><em>sur, </em>to turn aside, or back. We ought to say then correctly, “into turnings aside.” But as this would be obscure, when the vine is spoken of, I have not hesitated to fix on another word: <em>How then art thou turned to me into the degenerations of a strange vine! </em>Some give this version, “into useless branches of grapes:” but I know not whence they have taken the words. I wish to keep to what is more genuine, — that the vine, which ought to have been fruitful, had so degenerated that it produced nothing, as we shall find in another place, but wild grapes. <span class="cite-ref">(51)</span> And he calls them the turnings aside of a strange vine, which ceases to be the choice vine, <span class="lang he-il">שורק</span>, <em>shur </em>e<em>k, </em>and is turned to a wild vine, which produces nothing but sour or bitter fruit: and in the last place, as it brought forth nothing useful, God justly calls it a strange vine. It follows — </p><p><strong>(50)</strong> The word means not only the seed of vegetables, but whatever forms that from which anything grows. It is applied as a verb to the planting of shoots or cuttings in <span class="bvs">Isa_17:10</span>. The proper rendering here would be, — </p><p>The whole of it a genuine plant (or shoot). </p><p>What is rendered “choice vine,” <span class="lang he-il">שורק</span> is the yellow vine; the best was so called, because it produced wine of that color. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><strong>(51)</strong> Much difference exists as to the literal meaning of this clause, though the general meaning is quite evident. None of the early versions are the same. The word <span class="lang he-il">סורי</span> is rendered, “into bitterness — <span class="lang el-gr">εἰς πικρίαν</span>,” by the <em>Septuagint; </em>“thou hast rebelled,” by the <em>Syriac; </em>“into what is corrupt — in pravurn,” by the <em>Vulgate; </em>“thou hast declined from my fear,” by the <em>Targum Blarney </em>takes it as a verb in the imperative mood, and renders the two lines thus, — </p><p>Yet how I find thee changed! Depart, O vine of spurious growth. </p><p>But there is a harshness and incongruity in this version that renders it inadmissible. Besides “vine of spurious growth” is not the meaning of the words used, for it is “a foreign vine,” that is, a heathen vine; which contains an allusion to the idolatry which had been imported from heathen nations. </p><p>It is most probable that <span class="lang he-il">סורי</span>, or in full, <span class="lang he-il">סורים</span>, means degenerate shoots or branches, as <em>Parkhurst </em>thinks. To turn aside, to decline, to degenerate, seems to be the most common meaning of the verb. There would in this case be a congruity in the whole verse, — </p><p>And I myself had planted thee a choice vine, The whole of it a genuine plant; How then art thou become to me The degenerate shoots of a foreign vine? </p><p>The plant was of the best kind, but the shoots or the branches had become degenerated, such as a foreign or heathen vine produced. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
