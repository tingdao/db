<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness. </em>Thus we see that Christ put his finger on the sore, when he told them that they came like brute beasts to fill their belly; for they discover this gross disposition, when they demand a Messiah by whom they are to be fed. And as to the magnificent terms in which they extol the grace of God in the<em>manna, </em>they do this cunningly, in order to bury the doctrine of Christ, by which he condemned them for immoderate desire of corruptible food; for they contrast with it the magnificent title bestowed on the <em>manna, </em>when it is called <em>heavenly bread </em>But when the Holy Spirit bestows on the <em>manna </em>the honorable appellation of <em>the bread of heaven</em>, (<span class="bvs">Psa_78:24</span>,) it is not with this intention, as if God fed his people, like a herd of swine, and gave them nothing more valuable; and, therefore, they are without excuse, when they wickedly reject the spiritual food of the soul, which God now offers to them. </p></div>
