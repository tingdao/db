<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>Paul an Apostle. </em>I have already, in repeated instances, explained the design of such inscriptions. As, however, the Colossians had never seen him, and on that account his authority was not as yet so firmly established among them as to make his private name <span class="cite-ref">(278)</span> by itself sufficient, he premises that he is an Apostle of Christ set apart by the will of God. From this it followed, that he did not act rashly in writing to persons that were not known by him, inasmuch as he was discharging an embassy with which God had intrusted him. For he was not bound to one Church merely, but his Apostleship extended to all. The term <em>saints </em>which he applies to them is more honorable, but in calling them <em>faithful brethren, </em>he allures them more willingly to listen to him. As for other things, they may be found explained in the foregoing Epistles. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(278)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Son simple et priué nom</span>;” — “His simple and private name.” </p></div></div>
