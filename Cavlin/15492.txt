<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>Sing unto Jehovah a new song </em>I have already remarked, that the expression here used denotes an extraordinary, not a common, ascription of praise. This appears from the reason assigned for it, That God had manifested his salvation in a singular and incredible manner. For having spoken of <em>marvelous things, </em>he represents this as the sum of all, that God had procured salvation <em>with his own right hand; </em><span class="cite-ref">(108)</span> that is, not by human means, or in an ordinary way, but delivering his Church in an unprecedented manner. Isaiah enlarges upon this miracle of God’s power: </p><p>“The Lord looked if there were any to help, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation, and his righteousness sustained him,”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_59:16</span>) </p><p>In both passages <em>the arm of God </em>stands opposed to ordinary means, which although when employed they derogate nothing from the glory of God, yet prevent us from so fully discovering his presence as we might otherwise do. The language of the Psalmist amounts to a declaration that God would not save the world by means of an ordinary kind, but would come forth himself and show that he was the author of a salvation in every respect so singular. He reasonably infers that mercy of such a wonderful, and, to us, incomprehensible kind, should be celebrated by no ordinary measures of praise. This is brought out still more clearly in the verse which follows, where it is said that <em>his salvation and righteousness are shown to the nations </em>What could have been less looked for than that light should have arisen upon these dark and benighted places, and that righteousness should have appeared in the habitations of desperate wickedness? Salvation is mentioned first, although it is, properly speaking, the effect of righteousness. Such an inversion of the natural order is often observed in stating divine benefits; nor is it surprising that what is the means, and should be mentioned first, is sometimes set last, and follows by way of explanation. I may add, that the righteousness of God, which is the source of salvation, does not consist in his recompensing men according to their works, but is just the illustration of his mercy, grace, and faithfulness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(108)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car apres avoir parle des miracles, il les restreint specialement a une somme, ascavoir, que Dieu </span><em class="lang fr-fr">s </em><span class="lang fr-fr">’</span><em class="lang fr-fr">est acquis salut par sa propre vertu </em>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
