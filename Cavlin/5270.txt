<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>When the Lord thy God shall cut off. </em>This passage has some affinity to that in the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, which we have already remarked on. For inasmuch as it was easy for the people to lapse into the imitation of the Gentiles, and to worship their false gods, under whose protection the inhabitants boasted their land to be, all inquiry respecting them is also strictly forbidden. <span class="cite-ref">(305)</span> For this is the origin of idolatry, when the genuine simplicity of God’s worship is known, that people begin to be dissatisfied with it, and curiously to inquire whether there is anything worthy of belief in the figments of men; for men’s minds are soon attracted by the snares of novelty, so as to pollute, with various kinds of leaven, what has been delivered in God’s word. Nor does he only withdraw and restrain them from the desire of inquiry, but expressly commands them to “take heed to” themselves, or to keep themselves; because men are naturally disposed to this wanton curiosity, and take much delight in it. Therefore God encloses His people with barriers, which may keep them back from all hurtful desires; nay, He would have them so abominate the practice of superstitions, as to fly even from the infection of hearing of them. We must briefly observe respecting the words, which we have translated “to possess the nations,” that Moses does not mean that they were to become their prey, so as to be their slaves by right of capture, but that he refers to the land. Therefore he says, “thou shalt possess them before thy face;” <em>i.e., </em>when they are destroyed, the land will be vacant for you to possess it. In the <em>Hiphil </em>conjugation this word signifies to expel, as we have already seen; and to this meaning Moses perhaps makes allusion. The word <span class="cite-ref">(306)</span> which I have translated <em>“illa-queare,” </em>to snare, some interpreters render to <em>stumble, </em>and others to be <em>carried away, </em>which would be more agreeable to the construction, “lest you should be carried away after them;” yet I have been unwilling to depart from the generally received opinion, when the metaphor of “ensnaring” is very appropriate; as if he had said, that all the perversities of the Gentiles were so many nets or snares to entrap men, if they come too near them; for it presently follows, “after that they be destroyed,” which some also thus render, “lest you should perish after them,” as if He would awaken their fears by holding forth the example of their destruction. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(305)</span> Addition in French, “de peur que de l’un ils ne vienent a l’autre;” for fear that they should pass from one to the other. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(306)</span><span class="lang he-il">תנקש</span>, 2. fut. pass. of <span class="lang he-il">נקש</span>. The Chaldee paraphrast is cited by <em>S. M. </em>as explaining it by a word equivalent to <em>thou stumble. </em>It does not appear who has rendered it <em>be carried away. </em>— <em>W. </em></p><p>Pol.
