<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Son</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(544)</span><em>thou art always with me. </em>This answer consists of two parts. The first is, that the <em>first-born son </em>has no reason to be angry, when he sees his brother kindly received without any loss to himself; <span class="cite-ref">(545)</span> and the second is, that, without paying any regard to his brother’s safety, he is grieved on account of the rejoicing occasioned by his return. <em>All my property, </em>says he, <em>is thine: </em>that is, “Though thou hast hitherto carried nothing away out of my house, it has been no loss to the for all is reserved for thee undiminished.” <span class="cite-ref">(546)</span> Besides, why art thou offended at our joy, in which thou oughtest to have shared? for it was proper that thy brother, who we thought had been lost, should now be congratulated on his safety and return. Those two reasons deserve our attention; for, on the one hand, it is no loss to us, <span class="cite-ref">(547)</span> if God graciously receives into favor those who had been at variance with him on account of their sins; and, on the other hand, it is wicked hardness of heart not to rejoice, when we see our brethren returned from death to life. <span class="cite-ref">(548)</span></p><p><strong>(544)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mon enfant</span>;” — <em>“ </em>my child.” </p><p><strong>(545)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Veu qu’il n’y perd rien</span>;” — “since he loses nothing by it.” </p><p><strong>(546)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ta condition n’en est pas pire; car ie te garde tousiours ton droict entier</span>;” — “thy condition is not the worse for it; for I always preserve thy rights entire.” </p><p><strong>(547)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nous n’y perdons rien</span>;” — “we lose nothing by it.” </p><p><strong>(548)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Voyans nos freres estre tirez de la mort, et ramenez au chemin de vie</span>;” — “perceiving our brethren to be drawn from death, and led into the way of life.” </p></div>
