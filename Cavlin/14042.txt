<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Put them in fear, O Jehovah. </em>The Septuagint translates <span class="lang he-il">מורה</span>, <em>morah, </em>[<span class="lang el-gr">νομοθέτης</span>,]<em>a lawgiver, </em>deriving it from <span class="lang he-il">ירה</span>,<em>yarah, </em>which sometimes signifies <em>to teach. </em><span class="cite-ref">(185)</span> But the scope of the passage requires that we should understand it of fear or dread; and this is the opinion of all sound expositors. Now, it is to be considered of what kind of fear David speaks. God commonly subdues even his chosen ones to obedience by means of fear. But as he moderates his rigour towards them, and, at the same time, softens their stony hearts, so that they willingly and quietly submit themselves to him, he cannot be properly said to compel them by fear. With respect to the reprobate, he takes a different way of dealing. As their obduracy is inflexible, so that it is easier to break than to bend them, he subdues their desperate obstinacy by force; not, indeed, that they are reformed, but, whether they will or no, an acknowledgement of their own weakness is extorted from them. They may gnash their teeth and boil with rage, and even exceed in cruelty wild beasts, but when the dread of God seizes upon them, they are thrown down with their own violence, and fall with their own weight. Some explain these words as a prayer that God would bring the nations under the yoke of David, and make them tributaries to his government; but this is a cold and forced explanation. The word <em>fear </em>comprehends in general all the plagues of God, by which is repulsed, as by the heavy blows of a hammer, <span class="cite-ref">(186)</span> the rebellion of those who would never obey him except by compulsion. </p><p>There follows next the point to which the nations must be brought, namely, to acknowledge themselves to be mortal men. This, at first sight, seems to be a matter of small importance; but the doctrine which it contains is far from being trifling. What is man, that he dares of himself to move a finger? And yet all the ungodly run to excess as boldly and presumptuously as if there were nothing to hinder them from doing whatever they please. It is certainly through a distempered imagination that they claim to themselves what is peculiar to God; and, in short, they would never run to so great excess if they were not ignorant of their own condition. David, when he beseeches God to strike the nations with terror, that they <em>may know that they are men, </em><span class="cite-ref">(187)</span> does not mean that the ungodly will profit so much under the rods and chastisements of God as to humble themselves truly and from the heart; but the knowledge of which he speaks just means an experience of their own weakness. His language is as if he had said, Lord, since it is their ignorance of themselves which hurries them into their rage against me, make them actually to experience that their strength is not equal to their infatuated presumption, and after they are disappointed of their vain hopes, let them lie confounded and abased with shame. It may often happen that those who are convinced of their own weakness do not yet reform; but much is gained when their ungodly presumption is exposed to mockery and scorn before the world, that it may appear how ridiculous was the confidence which they presumed to place in their own strength. With respect to the chosen of God, they ought to profit under his chastisements after another manner. It becomes them to be humbled under a sense of their own weakness, and willingly to divest themselves of all vain confidence and presumption. And this will be the case if they remember that they are but men. Augustine has well and wisely said, that the whole humility of man consists in the knowledge of himself. Moreover, since pride is natural to all, God requires to strike terror into all men indiscriminately, that, on the one hand, his own people may learn to be humble, and that, on the other hand, the wicked, although they cease not to elevate themselves above the condition of man, may be put back with shame and confusion. </p><p><strong>(185)</strong> The Chaldee version reads <em>fear, </em>but the Syriac, Ethiopic, and Vulgate versions follow the Septuagint. The Arabic employs a word of nearly the same import, signifying <em>a doctor or teacher of the law. </em>In it is, “O Lord set a schoolmaster over them.” <em>Augustine </em>and <em>Jerome</em>, who adopted the reading of the Septuagint, render the words, “Set, O Lord, a lawgiver over them;” and it was their opinion that <em>lawgiver </em>means antichrist, to whom God in his wrath gave dominion over the nations. According to others, lawgiver means Christ. <em>Dr Horsley </em>reads, “O Jehovah, appoint thou a teacher over them.” <em>Ainsworth </em>and <em>Dr Adam Clarke </em>adopt the same rendering, and view the words as a prayer that the nations may learn humility and piety, that they may know their accountability to God, and become wise unto salvation. </p><p><strong>(186)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tous fleax de Dieu par lesquels est rembarre comme a grans coups de marteau</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(187)</strong> The original word is <span class="lang he-il">אנוש</span>, <em>enosh; </em>and therefore it is a prayer that they may know themselves to be but miserable, frail, and dying men. The word is in the singular number, but it is used collectively. </p></div>
