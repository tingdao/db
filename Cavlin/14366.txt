<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Many sorrows shall be to the wicked. </em>Without a figure he here declares what will be the condition of the rebellious and stiff-necked. <span class="cite-ref">(669)</span> He mentioned before that God wanted not bridles and bits with which to restrain their frowardness; and now he adds, that there would be no end or measure of their miseries until they were utterly consumed. Although God, therefore, may spare us for a time, yet let this denunciation fill us with fear, and preserve us from hardening ourselves, because we are as yet unpunished; nor let our prosperity, which is cursed by God, so deceive us as to close our minds against reflecting on those unseen sorrows which he threatens against all the wicked. And as the Psalmist has told us, on the one hand, that God is armed with innumerable plagues against the wicked, so he adds, on the other hand, that he is furnished with infinite goodness, with which he can succor all who are his. The sum is, that there is no other remedy for our afflictions but to humble ourselves under God’s hand, and to found our salvation on his mercy alone; and that those who rely on God shall be blessed in all respects, because, on whatever side Satan may assault them, there will the Lord oppose him, and shield them with his protecting power. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(669)</span><em>Fry </em>reads, “Many are the wounds of the refractory;” on which he has the following note:- “We perceive in this place the exact idea of <span class="lang he-il">ושץ</span>, in its allusion to the restive, disobedient, unyielding, ungovernable mule or horse. It is opposed to <span class="lang he-il">בטח</span>, <em>to confide in, to yield to, </em>or <em>succumb, </em>as the gentle beast fully confides and yields himself to the management of his guide.” </p></div></div>
