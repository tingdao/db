<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Wherefore we strive. </em>Having shown how magnanimous Christians ought to be in the endurance of afflictions, <span class="cite-ref">(531)</span> so that even in dying they may be conquerors over death, and that too, because by afflictions and death they attain to a blessed life, he now from the same source draws also another conclusion — that they must, by all means, make it their main desire to please God. And indeed it cannot but be, that the hope of a resurrection, and thoughtfulness as to the judgment, will awaken in us this desire; as, on the other hand, the true reason why we are so indolent and remiss in duty is, that we seldom, if ever, think of what ought to be constantly kept in remembrance, <span class="cite-ref">(532)</span> that we are here but lodgers <span class="cite-ref">(533)</span> for a short time, that we may, after finishing our course, return to Christ. Observe, however, what he says — that this is the desire both of the <em>living </em>and of the <em>dead, </em>by which statement the immortality of the soul is again confirmed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(531)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quelle constance et magnanimite doyuent auoir les Chrestiens en leurs afflictions</span>;” — “What constancy and magnanimity Christians ought to have in their afflictions.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(532)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nous deurions auoir incessamment deuant les yeux et en memoire</span>;” — “We ought to have unceasingly before our eyes and in our remembrance.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(533)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nous sommes yci estrangers</span>;” — “We are strangers here.” </p></div></div>
