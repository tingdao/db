<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>He spat on the ground. </em>The intention of Christ was, to restore sight to <em>the blind man</em>, but he commences the operation in a way which appears to be highly absurd; for, by <em>anointing his eyes with clay</em>, he in some respects doubles the <em>blindness </em>Who would not have thought either that he was mocking the wretched man, or that he was practising senseless and absurd fooleries? But in this way he intended to try the faith and obedience of <em>the blind man, </em>that he might be an example to all. It certainly was no ordinary proof of faith, that <em>the blind man, </em>relying on a bare word, is fully convinced that his sight will be restored to him, and with this conviction hastens to go to the place where he was commanded. It is an illustrious commendation of his obedience, that he simply obeys Christ, though there are many inducements to an opposite course. And this is the trial of true faith, when the devout mind, satisfied with the simple word of God, promises what otherwise appears incredible. Faith is instantly followed by a readiness to obey, so that he who is convinced that God will be his faithful guide calmly yields himself to the direction of God. There can be no doubt that some suspicion and fear that he was mocked came into the mind of <em>the blind man; </em>but he found it easy to break through every obstruction, when he arrived at the conclusion that it was safe to follow Christ. It may be objected that <em>the blind man </em>did not know Christ; and, therefore, could not render the honor which was due to him as the Son of God. I acknowledge this to be true; but as he believed that Christ had been sent by God, he submits to him, and not doubting that he speaks the truth, he beholds in him nothing but what is Divine; and, in addition to all this, his faith is entitled to the greater commendation, because, while his knowledge was so small, he devoted himself wholly to Christ. </p></div>
