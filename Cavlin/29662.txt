<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>Now I beseech you, by the coming</em>. It may indeed be read, as I have noted on the margin, <em>concerning the coming</em>, but it suits better to view it as an earnest entreaty, taken from the subject in hand, just as in <span class="bvs">1Co_15:31</span>, when discoursing as to the hope of a resurrection, he makes use of an oath by that <em>glory </em>which is to be hoped for by believers. And this has much more efficacy when he adjures believers by the coming of Christ, not to imagine rashly that his day is at hand, for he at the same time admonishes us not to think of it but with reverence and sobriety. For it is customary to adjure by those things which are regarded by us with reverence. The meaning therefore is, “As you set a high value on the coming of Christ, when he will gather us to himself, and will truly perfect that unity of the body which we cherish as yet only in part through means of faith, so I earnestly beseech you by his coming not to be too credulous, should any one affirm, on whatever pretext, that his day is at hand.” </p><p>As he had in his former Epistle adverted to some extent to the resurrection, it is possible that some fickle and fanatical persons took occasion from this to mark out a near and fixed day. For it is not likely that this error had taken its rise earlier among the Thessalonians. For Timothy, on returning thence, had informed Paul as to their entire condition, and as a prudent and experienced man had omitted nothing that was of importance. Now if Paul had received notice of it, he could not have been silent as to a matter of so great consequence. Thus I am of opinion, that when Paul’s Epistle had been read, which contained a lively view of the resurrection, some that were disposed to indulge curiosity philosophized unseasonably as to the time of it. This, however, was an utterly ruinous fancy, <span class="cite-ref">(636)</span> as were also other things of the same nature, which were afterwards disseminated, not without artifice on the part of Satan. For when any day is said to be <em>near</em>, if it does not quickly arrive, mankind being naturally impatient of longer delay, their spirits begin to languish, and that languishing is followed up shortly afterwards by despair. </p><p>This, therefore, was Satan’s subtlety: as he could not openly overturn the hope of a resurrection with the view of secretly undermining it, as if by pits underground, <span class="cite-ref">(637)</span> he promised that the day of it would be near, and would soon arrive. Afterwards, too, he did not cease to contrive various things, with the view of effacing, by little and little, the belief of a resurrection from the minds of men, as he could not openly eradicate it. It is, indeed, a plausible thing to say that the day of our redemption is definitely fixed, and on this account it meets with applause on the part of the multitude, as we see that the dreams of Lactantius and the Chiliasts of old gave much delight, and yet they had no other tendency than that of overthrowing the hope of a resurrection. This was not the design of Lactantius, but Satan, in accordance with his subtlety, perverted his curiosity, and that of those like him, so as to leave nothing in religion definite or fixed, and even at the present day he does not cease to employ the same means. We now see how necessary Paul’s admonition was, as but for this all religion would have been overturned among the Thessalonians under a specious pretext. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(636)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vne fantasie merueilleusement pernicieuse, et pour ruiner tout</span>;” — “A fancy that was singularly destructive, and utterly ruinous.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(637)</span> See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 38. </p></div></div>
