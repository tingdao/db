The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">עשק</span> (<em>gnōshĕk</em>) denotes “robbery,” and “seizing property which belongs to another.” Others render it “ill-gotten wealth.” Those who render it “calumny,” do not sufficiently express the Prophet’s meaning. For my own part, I do not view it as referring to riches gained by unlawful methods, but rather to that rebelliousness in which that nation insolently indulged. </p><p>The word “wickedness,” <span class="cite-ref">(291)</span> which is added, ought not to be limited to decisions of courts of law; for, in my opinion, it has a more extensive signification; and by these two words he intended to express the presumption of wicked men, by which they fiercely and wantonly rose up against God, because they always dared to follow their own lawless desires, and to do what was forbidden. And as the poets feign that the giants made war with God, <span class="cite-ref">(292)</span> so those men resisted God’s threatenings, and thought that they would speedily overcome his power by their fierceness and presumption. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(291)</span> Bogus footnote </p><p><span class="cite-note">(292)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
