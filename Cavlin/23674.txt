<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_16:1</span><strong>.</strong><em>And the Pharisees came. </em>Mark says that they <em>began to dispute</em>, from which we may conjecture that, when they had been vanquished in argument, this was their last resource; as obstinate men, whenever they are reduced to extremities, to avoid being compelled to yield to the truth, are accustomed to introduce something which is foreign to the subject. Though the nature of the dispute is not expressed, yet I think it probable that they debated about the calling of Christ, why he ventured to make any innovation, and why he made such lofty pretensions, as if by his coming he had fully restored the kingdom of God. Having nothing farther to object against his doctrine, they demand that he <em>shall give them a sign from heaven. </em>But it is certain that a hundred <em>signs </em>would have no greater effect than the testimonies of Scripture. Besides, many miracles already performed had placed before their eyes the power of Christ, and had almost enabled them to touch it with their hands. <em>Signs</em>, by which Christ made himself familiarly known, are despised by them; and how much less will they derive advantage from a distant and obscure <em>sign? </em>Thus the Papists of our own day, as if the doctrine of the Gospel had not yet been proved, demand that it be ascertained by means of new miracles. </p><p><em>The Pharisees, together with the Sadducees. </em>It deserves our attention that, though <em>the Sadducees </em>and <em>the Pharisees </em>looked upon each other as enemies, and not only cherished bitter hatred, but were continually engaged in hostilities, yet they enter into a mutual league against Christ. In like manner, though ungodly men quarrel among themselves, their internal broils never prevent them from conspiring against God, and entering into a compact for joining their hands in persecuting the truth. </p><p><em>Tempting. </em>By this word the Evangelists mean that it was not with honest intentions, nor from a desire of instruction, but by cunning and deceit, that they demanded what they thought that Christ would refuse, or at least what they imagined was not in his power. Regarding him as utterly mean and despicable, they had no other design than to expose his weakness, and to destroy all the applause which he had hitherto obtained among the people. In this manner unbelievers are said to <em>tempt </em>God, when they murmur at being denied what their fancy prompted them to ask, and charge God with want of power. </p></div>
