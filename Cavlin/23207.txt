<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>I have need to be baptized by thee. </em>It is certain, that John acknowledged Christ to be not only a distinguished prophet, as many foolishly dream, but the Son of God, as he really was: for otherwise he would have dishonored God by lowering his holy calling to a mortal man. How he came to know this, the reader will learn by consulting John’s Gospel, (<span class="bvs">Joh_1:15</span>) There was, no doubt, plausibility in this ground of refusal, that Christ had no need of his baptism: but John was mistaken in not considering, that it was for the sake of others that baptism was asked. <span class="cite-ref">(294)</span> And so Christ bids him consider, what was suitable to the character of a <em>servant</em>, (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>,) which he had undertaken; for a voluntary subjection takes nothing from his glory. Though the good man <span class="cite-ref">(295)</span> remained ignorant, for a time, of some part of his public duty, this particular error did not prevent him from discharging, in a proper and lawful manner, his office of Baptist. This example shows, that we do not act rashly, in undertaking the commission which the Lord has given us, according to the light we enjoy, though we do not immediately comprehend all that belongs to our calling, or that depends upon it. We must also observe his modesty, in giving up his opinion, and immediately obeying Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(294)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que c'est pour le profit des autres, et non pas pour le sien, que Christ demande d'estre baptize</span>.” — “That it is for the benefit of others, and not for his own, that Christ asks to be baptized.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(295)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quelque excellent personnage qu'il fust</span>.” — “However excellent a person he was.” </p></div></div>
