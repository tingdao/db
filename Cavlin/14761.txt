<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>Every day my words vex me </em>The first part of this verse has been variously rendered. Some understand <em>my words </em>to be the nominative in the sentence, and with these I agree in opinion. Others suppose a reference to the enemies of David, and translate, <em>they calumniate my words, </em>or, <em>they cause me grief on account of my words. </em>Again, <span class="lang he-il">יעצבו</span>, <em>yeatsebu, </em>has been taken in the neuter sense, and translated, <em>my words are troublesome. </em>But <span class="lang he-il">עצב</span><span class="cite-ref">(332)</span>, <em>atsab, </em>commonly signifies to <em>afflict with grief, </em>and in <em>Pihel </em>is always taken transitively; nor does there seem any reason in this place to depart from the general rule of the language. And the passage flows more naturally when rendered, <em>my words affect me with grief, </em>or <em>vex me, </em>than by supposing that he refers to his enemies. According to this translation, the verse contains a double complaint, that, on the one hand, he was himself unsuccessful in everything which he attempted, his plans having still issued in vexatious failure; while, on the other hand, his enemies were devising every means for his destruction. It may appear at first sight rather inconsistent to suppose that he should immediately before have disclaimed being under the influence of fear, and now acknowledge that he was not only distressed, but in some measure the author of his own discomfort. I have already observed, however, that he is not to be considered as having been absolutely divested of anxiety and fear, although enabled to look down with contempt upon his enemies from the eminence of faith. Here he speaks of the circumstances which tried him, which his faith certainly overcame, but at the same time could not altogether remove out of the way. He confesses his own lack of wisdom and foresight, shown in the abortive issue of every plan which he devised. It aggravated the evil, that his enemies were employing their united counsels to plot his ruin. He adds, that <em>they gathered themselves together; </em>and this made his case the more calamitous, matched as he was, a single individual, against this numerous host. In mentioning that they<em>hide themselves, </em>he adverts to the subtile devices which they framed for surprising him into destruction. The verb <span class="lang he-il">יצפינו</span>, <em>yitsponu, </em>by grammatical rule ought to have the letter <span class="lang he-il">ו</span>, <em>vau, </em>in the middle; from which the general opinion is, that the <span class="lang he-il">י</span><em>yod, </em>is as it were the mark of <em>Hiphil</em>, denoting that the enemies of David came to the determination of employing an ambush, with the view of surrounding him. He tells us that they pressed upon him in every direction, and as it were trod upon his heels, so that he had no respite. And he points at their implacable hatred as the cause of their eager pursuit of him; for nothing, he informs us, would satisfy them but his death. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(332)</span> Horsley observes, that the primary meaning of the verb <span class="lang he-il">עצב</span>, <em>atsab</em>, is “perhaps <em>to do a thing with great labor</em>, <em>to take pains about it</em>; if, indeed, its primary meaning be not <em>to distort </em>Hence it may signify to affect the mind with any unpleasing passion or sensation, grief, vexation, anger; for every perturbation is a sort of distortion of the mind. <span class="lang he-il">רברי יעצבו עלי</span> — ‘torquent contra me verba mea,’ — ‘torquent, <em>i e</em>. , labouriose fingunt in mentem alienam et sensum alienum.’ — Pagninus after Aben Ezra and R.D.”—<em>Horsley </em>Hammond, after stating that <span class="lang he-il">עזב</span>, <em>atsab</em>, signifies primarily <em>to grieve</em>, or <em>be in pain</em>, and that by metonomy it is used for the laborious framing or forming of any thing, says, “Here, being applied to another’s words or speeches, it seems to denote the depraving them, laboring and using great art and diligence to put them into such a form as may be most for the disadvantage of the speaker, turning and winding them to his hurt, in putting some odious gloss upon them, and so, according to sense, may most fully be rendered <em>depraving</em>. ” </p></div></div>
