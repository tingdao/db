<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>We then who are strong, etc. </em>Lest they who had made more advances than others in the knowledge of God should think it unreasonable, that more burden was to be laid on them than on others, he shows for what purpose this strength, by which they excelled others, was bestowed on them, even that they might so sustain the weak as to prevent them to fall. For as God has destined those to whom he has granted superior knowledge to convey instruction to the ignorant, so to those whom he makes strong he commits the duty of supporting the weak by their strength; thus ought all gifts to be communicated among all the members of Christ. The stronger then any one is in Christ, the more bound he is to bear with the weak. <span class="cite-ref">(437)</span></p><p>By saying that a Christian ought not to <em>please </em>himself, he intimates, that he ought not to be bent on satisfying himself, as they are wont to be, who are content with their own judgment, and heedlessly neglect others: and this is indeed an admonition most suitable on the present subject; for nothing impedes and checks acts of kindness more than when any one is too much swallowed up with himself, so that he has no care for others, and follows only his own counsels and feelings. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(437)</span> The word for “strong” is<span class="lang el-gr">δυνατοὶ, </span> “able,” which [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] renders <em>potentes </em>, powerful, or able. They were the more advanced in knowledge and in piety.

The duty is not merely to bear with or tolerate weaknesses, (for this is not the meaning of the verb,) but to help and assist the weak and the feeble to carry them. The most literal rendering is — </p><p>“We then who are able ought to bear (or carry)<LineBreak />the infirmities of the unable.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
