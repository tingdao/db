<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Who is like unto thee? </em>Moses concludes this song of praise with an ejaculation, because the grandeur of the subject transcends the power of words. The interrogation expresses more than as if he had simply asserted that none can be compared with God; because it marks both admiration and assured confidence in the truth of what he says; for he exclaims, as if overwhelmed with astonishment, “Who is like unto thee, O Lord?” The notion of some that by the word “gods” he means the angels, is more suitable to other passages; for instance, (<span class="bvs">Psa_89:6</span>,) “Who in heaven can be compared unto the Lord; who among the sons <span class="cite-ref">(162)</span> of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord?” for it immediately follows, “God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are round about him.” (<span class="bvs">Exo_15:7</span>, etc.) The meaning then is, <span class="cite-ref">(163)</span> that, although there be excellence in the angels, still God is exalted far above them all; but here it may be more properly referred to idols, for Moses (as has been said) is professedly contrasting’ the one true God, whose religion and worship existed among the children of Abraham, with the delusions of the Gentiles. The word “sanctitas,” holiness, expresses that glory which separates God from all His creatures; and therefore, in a manner, it degrades all the other deities which the world has invented for itself; since the majesty of the one only God is thus eminent and honorable. He adds, “fearful in praises;” because He cannot be duly praised, without ravishing us with astonishment. Moses afterwards explains himself, by saying that God’s works are wonderful. In my opinion, their explanation is a poor one, who think that He is said to be “fearful in praises,” because He is to be praised with fear; and theirs is farfetched, who say that he is terrible, even when he is praised. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(162)</span> Filios Dei. — <em>V. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(163)</span> “Or le Sainct Esprit veut dire;” now the Holy Spirit means to say. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
