<div class="comment-content"><p>The verb <span class="lang he-il">בגד</span>, <em>begad, </em>means to deceive, to act perfidiously. God then charges the Jews here with perfidy, because they had revolted from him: for he does not only complain that they had in some measure sinned against him, and that he was therefore offended with them, but he charges them with general defection. Hence he says, that both the Israelites and the Jews had become perfidious and apostates. The people, we knew, were now divided into two kingdoms: and though Jeremiah had been given especially as a teacher to the tribe of Judah, it was yet his duty to labor also for the Israelites. The kingdom of Israel was now in some measure fallen, for four tribes had been driven into exile, and the kingdom was dismembered and feeble. He yet wished to do all the good he could to the remnant. Hence he says here, that they were wicked apostates, for they had <em>acted perfidiously </em>towards God. <span class="cite-ref">(141)</span> And as this charge was heinous, and might have deeply wounded their minds, he ascribes to God what the Jews would have hardly endured as coming from him; and says, thus <em>saith Jehovah, </em>as though he had said, “There is no reason for you to contend with me, as though I had dealt severely with you: contend with God himself, since he it is who declares that you are all perfidious.” He afterwards adds — </p><p><strong>(141)</strong> The verb <span class="lang he-il">בגד</span>, when followed by <span class="lang he-il">ב</span> as here, means to deal deceitfully, perfidiously, or treacherously, with one. See <span class="bvs">Exo_21:8</span>; <span class="bvs">Jud_9:23</span>; <span class="bvs">Lam_1:2</span>. It may be rendered here to dissemble, — </p><p>For they dissembling have dissembled with me, The house of Israel and the house of Judah, saith Jehovah. </p><p>As the verb is repeated, if we render it “to act perfidiously,“ instead of repeating the words, to give them their force and meaning, we must say, </p><p>For they have dealt most perfidiously with me. </p><p>To “deal unfaithfully,” as rendered by <em>Blayney</em>, is too feeble an expression. To “prevaricate” is the word used by the <em>Vulgate, </em>and the same by the <em>Septuagint </em>and the <em>Targum. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
