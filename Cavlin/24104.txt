<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>49.</strong><em>Hail, Rabbi. </em>I have no doubt that Judas, as if trembling for his Master’s danger, pretended by these words to have some feeling of compassion; and, accordingly, in Mark a pathetic repetition is expressed, <span class="cite-ref">(213)</span><em>Rabbi, Rabbi. </em>For though he was impressed with the majesty of Christ, still the devil so fascinated his mind, that he felt assured that his treachery was concealed by <em>a kiss, </em>and by soothing words. This salutation, or exclamation, therefore, was a pretense of compassion. I offer the same opinion about the <em>kiss; </em>for though it was a very common practice among the Jews to welcome friends with <em>a kiss, </em>yet as Judas had left Christ but a little before, he seems now — as if he had become suddenly alarmed at his danger — to give the last <em>kiss </em>to his Master. Thus he excels the rest in the appearance of affection, when he appears to be deeply grieved at being separated from his Master; but how little he gained by his deception is evident from Christ’s reply. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(213)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il y a une repetition comme d’un homme parlant de grande affection</span>;” — “there is a repetition, as if by a man who spoke from strong feeling.” </p></div></div>
