<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Changing their minds, they said. </em>This so wonderful and sudden a change ought to have inwardly touched the men of Melita, and to have moved them to give the glory to the mercy of God, as they did before to vengeance. But as man’s reason is always carried amiss unto extremities, they make Paul at a sudden a god, whom they took before to be a wicked murderer. But if he could not choose but be the one, it had been better for him to be counted a murderer than a god. And surely Paul would rather have wished to be condemned, not only of one crime, but also to have sustained all shame,<span class="cite-ref">(661)</span> and to have been thrust down into the deep pit of hell,<span class="cite-ref">(662)</span> than to take to himself the glory of God, which thing those knew full well who had heard him preach amidst the storms. Notwithstanding, it may be, that, being taught afterward, they did confess that God was the author of the miracle.</p><p>Furthermore, let us learn by this history, with patient and quiet minds, to wait for the prosperous event of things,<span class="cite-ref">(663)</span> which seem at the first to tend toward the robbing of God of his honor. Which of us would not have been terrified with this spectacle which did arm the wicked to slander with all manner of slanderous speeches the glory of the gospel? Yet we see how God did in good time prevent this inconvenience; therefore, let us not doubt but that after he hath suffered his to be darkened with clouds of slanders, he will send remedy in his good time, and will turn their darkness into light. In the mean season, let us remember that we must beware of the judgment of the flesh. And because men do always forget themselves, let us beg of God the Spirit of moderation, that he may keep us always in the right mean. Furthermore, let us learn by this how ready the world is to fall to superstition. Yea, this wickedness is in a manner born with us, to be desirous to adorn creatures with that which we take from God.</p><p>Wherefore, no marvel if new errors have come abroad<span class="cite-ref">(664)</span> in all ages, seeing every one of us is, even from his mother’s womb, expert in inventing idols. But lest men excuse themselves therewithal, this history doth witness that this is the fountain of superstitions, because men are unthankful to God, and do give his glory to some other. </p><p><strong>(661)</strong></p><p>“ Omni infamiae genere,” every kind of infamy. </p><p><strong>(662)</strong></p><p>“ Ad inferos,” to the dead. </p><p><strong>(663)</strong></p><p>“ Tristium rerum,” of gloomy affairs. </p><p><strong>(664)</strong></p><p>“ Subinde,” ever and anon. </p></div>
