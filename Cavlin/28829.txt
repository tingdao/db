<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>But if any one. </em>Here is a <em>third </em>reason with the view of alleviating the offense — that he had grief in common with them, and that the occasion of it came from another quarter. “We have,” says he, “been alike grieved, and another is to blame for it.” At the same time he speaks of that person, too, somewhat mildly, when he says, <em>if any one </em>— not affirming the thing, but rather leaving it in suspense. This passage, however, is understood by some, as if Paul meant to say: “He that has given me occasion of grief, has given offense to you also; for you ought to have felt grieved along with me, and yet I have been left almost to grieve alone. For I do not wish to say so absolutely — <em>that I may not put the blame upon you all.” </em>In this way the second clause would contain a correction of the first. Chrysostom’s exposition, however, is much more suitable; for he reads it as one continued sentence — “<em>He hath not grieved me alone, but almost all of you. </em>And as to my saying <em>in part, </em>I do so in order that I may not <em>bear too hard upon him.” </em><span class="cite-ref">(320)</span> I differ from Chrysostom merely in the clause <em>in part, </em>for I understand it as meaning <em>in some measure. </em>I am aware, that Ambrose understands it as meaning — part of the saints, inasmuch as the Church of the Corinthians was divided; but that is more ingenious than solid. </p><p><strong>(320)</strong> “The words may be rendered: ‘But if any one (meaning the incestuous person) have occasioned sorrow, he hath not so much grieved <em>me</em>, as, in some measure (that I may not bear too hard upon him) all of <em>you </em><span class="lang el-gr">᾿Επιβαρῶ῎῝8217;</span> must, with the Syr. version and Emmerling, be taken intransitively, in the sense — ‘ne quid gravius dicam,’ (that I may not say anything too severe,) <em>i.e.</em>, ‘ne dicam nos solos,’ (that I may not say — us alone.) Of this sense of <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπιβαρεῖν τινι</span>, to <em>bear hard upon</em>, two examples are adduced by Wetstein from Appian.” — <em>Bloomfield</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
