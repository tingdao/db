<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>62.</strong><em>What if you shall see the Son of man ascend to where he was before? </em>The mean and despicable condition of Christ which they saw before their eyes, while, clothed with flesh, he was not at all different from other men, prevented them from submitting to his Divine power; but now — by withdrawing, as it were, the veil — he calls them to behold his heavenly glory, as if he had said, “Because I converse among men without honor, I am despised by you, and you recognize in me nothing that is Divine; but ere long God will adorn me with splendid power, and, withdrawing me from the contemptible state of mortal life, will raise me above the heavens.” For, in the resurrection of Christ, so great was the power displayed by the Holy Spirit, that it plainly showed Christ to be the Son of God, as Paul also shows, (<span class="bvs">Rom_1:4</span>.) And when it is said, </p><p>Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_2:7</span>,) </p><p>the resurrection is brought forward as a proof from which that glory of Christ ought to be acknowledged, and his <em>ascension </em>to heaven was the completion of that glory. When he says that <em>he was formerly in heaven</em>, this does not apply strictly to his human nature, and yet he speaks of<em>the Son of man; </em>but since the two natures in Christ constitute one person, it is not an unusual way of speaking to transfer to one nature what is peculiar to the other. </p></div>
