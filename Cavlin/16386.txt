<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And hath exalted the horn</em>, <em>etc</em>. As we saw in the former Psalm, that the perfections of God are to be seen more conspicuously in the Church than in the constitution of the world at large, the Psalmist has added this sentence, as to the Church being protected by the divine hand, and armed with a power against all enemies which secures its safety in every danger. By <em>the horn</em>, as is well known, is meant strength or dignity. Accordingly the Psalmist means that God’s blessing is apparent in his Church and among his chosen people, inasmuch as it only flourishes and is powerful through his strength. There is a tacit comparison implied between the Church of God and other hostile powers, for it needs divine guardianship as being exposed on all sides to attack. Hence the Psalmist infers that <em>praise is to all the merciful ones of God</em>, for they have ground given them in the singular goodness of his condescension both for self-congratulation and praise. In calling the children of Israel <em>a people near unto God, </em>he reminds them of the gracious covenant which God made with Abraham. For how came the nearness, except in the way of God’s preferring an unknown despised stranger to all nations? Nor are we to seek the cause of the distinction elsewhere than in the mere love of God. Though all the world equally belongs to God, he graciously discovered himself to the children of Israel, and brought them near to him, strangers as they were from God, even as are the whole race of Adam. Hence the words of Moses — </p><p>“When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, and distributed the peoples, he stretched forth his line to Jacob.” (<span class="bvs">Deu_32:8</span>.) </p><p>He is to be considered, therefore, as pointing out the cause why God hath extended such signal blessings to a single people, and a people poor and despised — his adoption of them to himself. </p></div>
