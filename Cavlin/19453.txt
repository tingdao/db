<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Thus saith Jehovah, </em>he adds, <em>Judge ye judgment </em>There was no doubt a great liberty taken by the king and his courtiers in committing plunder, for the Prophet would not have here recommended justice to them had they not wholly neglected what was just and right. As, then, there was no care to administer justice, the Prophet bade them to recognize what was due to God and to his people. But it was a most grievous trial to all the godly to see that the sacred house, in which the living image of God ought to have shone forth brightly, was become a house of spoils, where robbers dwelt, who with impunity plundered all around them. When, therefore, the state of things is in such a disorder that the very judges, whom God has set over his Church, are like robbers, let us know that such a thing happened formerly; nor is there a doubt but that God thus took vengeance on the impiety and wickedness of the people, for he would have never suffered that house to be so contaminated and so filled with so many crimes, had not the people been unworthy of a good and faithful king and of upright counsellors. Let us, then, know that the Prophet exhorted the king and his counsellors to execute justice, because they had forgotten their office, and were become like rapacious wolves. <span class="cite-ref">(27)</span></p><p>He specifies one act, <em>Free ye the spoiled from the hand of his oppressor </em>Some read, “from the hand of the fraudulent,” as though <span class="lang he-il">עשק</span>, <em>oshek, </em>should mean to oppress by calumny and malice, or by fraudulent means; but it is to be taken otherwise here. Some distinguish between the two words <span class="lang he-il">עשק</span>, <em>oshek, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">גזל</span>, <em>gesal, </em>and say that the first means to retain a deposit or wages, or anything that belongs to another, and that the latter signifies to take a thing by force, to plunder. But this difference, as it appears, is not observed by the Prophet, for he says, “Free ye the plundered or the spoiled.” From whose hand? from “the hand of the oppressor.” As, then, these two words correspond, I doubt not but that <span class="lang he-il">גזל</span>, <em>gesal, </em>means both to take by force and to plunder; and that though <span class="lang he-il">עשק</span>, <em>oshek, </em>means often fraudulently to oppress, yet not always. However this may be, God intimates that neither the king nor his counsellors had any care for the poor, so as to repress violence, and robbery, and plunder. Then the very judges themselves were the associates of robbers, for they allowed them with impunity to rob and plunder without affording any aid to helpless men when they were thus wickedly harassed. There is, however, no doubt but that God would have them to perform their duties towards all, both rich and poor, without exception; but as injustice in this particular was especially seen, this is the reason why by stating a part for the whole he specified only one thing. <span class="cite-ref">(28)</span></p><p>He then adds, <em>Lest my indignation go forth like fire, and burn, and there be none to extinguish it </em>Here the Prophet intimates, that except the king and his courtiers repented, it was all over with them. There is then a contrast to be understood here between that paternal correction of which he had spoken, and the destruction of which the Prophet now speaks. God’s indignation had been already kindled, nor could it be immediately extinguished; and though they had to suffer, yet the issue would have been happy and according to their wishes: but he here declares that there would be an irreconcilable war with God, except they labored to return to his favor. He adds, <em>On account of the wickedness of their doings </em>There is here a change of person, except we read <span class="lang he-il">כם</span>, <em>cam, “you;” </em>but this sort of change often occurs in Scripture. The Prophet, after having addressed them, says now, “on account of the wickedness of their doings,” as though having finished his discourse, he spoke of them as being absent, or as though God, after having given orders to his Prophet, then added, “I denounce this on them, because they have so deserved.” </p><p><strong>(27)</strong> The correct rendering is, “The right defend ye in the morning.” The common meaning of <span class="lang he-il">דון</span> is to defend, to vindicate, to plead for, or contend for: it means, also, to rule with authority. It is rendered often in our version to judge, while it ought to be to defend. See <span class="bvs">Gen_30:6</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_1:4</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_135:14</span>. “In the morning” may be taken literally or figuratively. The morning was the time observed by good judges to decide matters of judgment: in corrupt times the judges or princes spent the morning in drinking. See <span class="bvs">Ecc_10:16</span>. Thus the judges are here required to reassume the ancient practice of deciding causes in the morning. See <span class="bvs">Exo_18:13</span>. The phrase, “in the morning,” means also to do a thing, promptly, fully, and diligently. The very same words are used in <span class="bvs">Psa_101:8</span>, and rendered in our version “early,” only the word for morning is in the plural number — “in the mornings,” literally. Then, if taken figuratively, the phrase means — promptly, carefully, diligently — “Defend carefully the right.” The version of Blayney is singular, but inadmissible — “Judge ye, searching out right.” There is no instance of the verb <span class="lang he-il">דון</span> being used intransitively, and “in the morning” is given by all the Versions and the Targ. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><strong>(28)</strong> This sentence is as follows, — “And rescue the plundered from the hand of the violent,” or him who uses violence. The Vulg. alone has “calumniator” for the last word, which is wholly improper; “who wrongs him” is the Sept.; “who oppresses him” is the Syr. and Arab. The word means to oppress by force or violence. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
