<div class="comment-content"><p>The command now follows, <em>Arise, go to Nineveh, to that great city, and preach there the preaching which I command thee. </em><span class="cite-ref">(42)</span> God again repeats what we have observed at the be ginning, — that Nineveh was a great city, that Jonah might provide himself with an invincible courage of mind, and come there well prepared: for it often happens, that many boldly undertake an office, but soon fail, because difficulties had not been sufficiently foreseen by them. Hence, when men find more hardships than they thought of at the beginning, they nearly faint, at least they despond. The Lord, therefore, expressly foretold Jonah how difficult would be his employment; as though he said, “I send thee, a man unknown, and of no rank, and a stranger, to denounce ruin on men, not a few in number, but on a vast multitude, and to carry on a contest with the noblest city, and so populous, that it may seem to be a region of itself.” </p><p>We now then understand why this character of the city was added; it was, that Jonah might gird up himself for the contest, that he might not afterwards fail in the middle of his course. This fear indeed frightened him at the beginning, so that he shunned the call of God; but he is not now moved in any degree by the greatness of the city, but resolutely follows where the Lord leads. We hence see, that faith, when once it gains the ascendancy in our hearts, surmounts all obstacles and despises all the greatness of the world; for it is immediately added — </p><p><strong>(42)</strong> Literally, “And proclaim to or against her the proclamation which I declare to thee.” The Septuagint is, “<span class="lang el-gr">Και κηρυξον εν αυτη κατα το κηρυγμα το εμπροσθεν ο</span> ̀̔ εγ<span class="lang el-gr">ω ελαλησα προς σε </span> — And preach in it the former preaching which I have spoken to thee.” <span class="lang he-il">עליה</span> in five MSS., as in chapter 1:2, “against her,” and not <span class="lang he-il">אליה</span>, “to her.” <span class="lang he-il">אשר אנכי דבר אליד</span>, “which I <em>am </em>speaking or declaring to thee.” <span class="lang he-il">דבר</span> is a participle; being preceded by a nominative, it will admit of an auxiliary verb either in the past, present or future tense, according to the context; though it is often used to express the present time. </p><p><em>Newcome </em>renders the sentence thus — “And cry unto her <em>in </em>the words which I <em>shall </em>speak unto thee;” <em>Henderson </em>more paraphrastically thus — “And make the proclamation to it which I order thee;” and adds the following remarks, — “Be my herald, and faithfully deliver my message. The word <span class="lang el-gr">κηρυξ</span> in Greek answers to the Hebrew <span class="lang he-il">קורא</span>, <em>kore</em>, both signifying a <em>crier, </em>a <em>herald, </em>a <em>preacher; </em>one that makes proclamation with a <em>loud </em>and <em>earnest </em>cry. Such was John Baptist, <span class="bvs">Isa_40:3</span>; such was Jesus Christ, <span class="bvs">Joh_7:18</span>; and such were all his apostles. And such earnestness becomes a ministry that has to do with immortal souls, asleep and dead in sin, hanging on the brink of perdition, and insensible of their state. The soft speaking, gentle toned, unmoved preacher, is never likely to awaken souls.” </p><p><em>Henry </em>considers that the commission was not specifically explained to him then. “Jonah must go,” he says, “with implicit faith: he shall not know till he comes thither what message he must deliver.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
