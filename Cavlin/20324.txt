<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet proceeds with the same subject, that God’s vengeance had raged most dreadfully agsinst Jerusalem. But employing a metaphor she says, that <em>fire </em>had been sent to her <em>bones</em>. They who interpret bones of fortified places, weaken the meaning of the Prophet. I take bones in their proper sense, ss though it was said, that God’s fire had penetrated into the inmost parts. This way of speaking often occurs in Scripture. By bones is denoted strength or valor. Hence David sometimes deplored, that his bones were vexed or troubled. (<span class="bvs">Psa_6:2</span>.) And Hezekiah said in his song </p><p>“As a lion he hath broken my bones.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_37:13</span>.) </p><p>In the same sense the Prophet now says, that <em>fire </em>had been <em>sent by God, which ruled in his bones</em>, that is, which not only burnt the skin and the flesh, but also consumed the bones. <span class="lang he-il">רדה</span>, <em>rede</em>, means also to take away or to receive: but as the former rendering is most commonly taken, I am disposed to follow it — that <em>fire ruled in his bones </em></p><p>There is another similitude added, that God had <em>spread a net before her feet; </em>and thus he had taken away every means of escape. She intimates (for it is Jerusalem who speaks) that she had been ensnared by God’s judgments, so that she was bound over to ruin, as though she had fallen into toils or snares. It is stated in the third place, that she was <em>desolate all the day, so that she sorrowed perpetually</em>. By all the day is meant continually. It is then said, that she sorrowed without end, beyond measure, because she had been turned back by the nets of God, and her bones had been consumed by celestial fire: for the expression <em>from above</em>, <span class="lang he-il">ממרום</span>, <em>memerumn</em>, is emphatical, for the Prophet means that it was no common or human burning; because what is ascribed to God exceeds what is human or earthly. It is, then, as though he had said, that it had been such a vengeance as betokened the dreadful power of God; for it was the same as though God had thundered from heaven. We now perceive the import of the words. It follows, — </p></div>
