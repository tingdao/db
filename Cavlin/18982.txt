<div class="comment-content"><p>By way of amplification he adds, <em>Also the sons of Noph and of Tephanes shall for thee break the head, </em>or, the crown of the head. We shall hereafter see that the Israelites were wont to seek help from the Egyptians. The particle <span class="lang he-il">גם</span>, <em>g </em>a<em>m</em>, may be thus explained, “Not only those who have been hitherto professed enemies to thee, but even thy friends, in whose help thou didst confide, shall turn their power against thee and break for thee thy head.” Some think that their degradation is here enhanced, because the Egyptians were an unwarlike people; and ancient historians say that men there followed the occupations of women; but as this is not mentioned in Scripture, and as the Egyptians are not thus spoken of in it, I prefer to follow the usual explanation, that the Egyptians, though confederate with Israel, would yet be adverse to them, and had been so already. By the <em>head, </em>some understand the chief men among the people of Israel: but we may render it thus, <em>they will break for thee the head, </em>as we say in our language, <em>Ils to romperont la tete, </em>or, <em>Ils to frotteront la tete; </em>and this, in my judgment, is the real meaning. <span class="cite-ref">(43)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(43)</span> There have been many expositions of this latter clause, which may be seen in the Assembly’s Annotations, which were written, as to Isaiah and Jeremiah, by the learned <em>Gataker</em>. He gives the preference to the idea, that the crown of the head means the best and the principal part of the land, and to break the crown means the plunder of this portion. See <span class="bvs">Isa_28:4</span>. This seems to correspond in meaning with the previous verse. It was the opinion <em>of Blarney </em>that an allusion is prophetically made to the slaying of Josiah by the Egyptians. The words literally are, — </p><p>They shall break thee, the crown of the head. </p><p>“The crown of the head” seems to be explanatory of “thee;” it might then be rendered, — </p><p>They shall break thee, even the crown of thy head. </p><p>The <em>Septuagint </em>mistook one letter for another, and took the verb to be, <span class="lang he-il">ידעוך</span>, “they knew thee,” instead of <span class="lang he-il">ירעוך</span> “they shall break thee;” but what they made the last word to be, it is hard to know, for they rendered it, “and searched thee.” The <em>Vulgate </em>has followed the <em>Septuagint; </em>and the idea is a very indecent one: and there is nothing in the context to favor it. The <em>Targum’s </em>paraphrase is this, “They shall slay thy brave men, and plunder thy riches;” which countenances the idea evidently conveyed by the figurative terms of the Hebrew. </p><p>The next verse literally rendered is as follows, — </p><p>Is not this what thou wilt do for thyself, <LineBreak />By thy forsaking of Jehovah thy God, <LineBreak />At the time he was leading thee in the way? </p><p>The first verb is no doubt future, whether it be rendered in the second or third person. The sentence may be rendered in <em>Welsh </em>without “Is,” or the relative “what,” and word for word, — </p><p>(lang. cy) Ai nid hyn a wnai i’th hun ? </p><p>And the future is understood as the present. Blayney’s version is, — </p><p>Shall not this be done unto thee, <LineBreak />Because thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, <LineBreak />At the time that he led thee in the way? </p><p>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
