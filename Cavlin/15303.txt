<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>His foundations are in the holy mountains. </em>Those who conceive that Jerusalem is here meant, as if it were said to <em>be founded upon the holy mountains, </em>are in my judgment mistaken; for the relative is in the masculine gender. Some learned men, I am aware, defend this opinion, by supposing that the words, <em>the people, </em>are to be supplied, although it is the capital of Judea which is specified. But it is unnecessary for me to say any thing to prove what is apparent to all, that this exposition is forced. Some Jewish interpreters have thought it most probable that this opening sentence is to be referred to the psalm itself; and, accordingly, they explain <em>foundations </em>as denoting metaphorically the theme, or subject of the poem, because it treats of the holy city Jerusalem, which was situated upon mountains. But I am surprised that they should have been mistaken in a matter so very obvious. It being quite a common thing among the Hebrews to put a relative without its antecedent, <span class="cite-ref">(495)</span> this manner of speaking ought not to seem harsh or strange. The name of God is mentioned a little after; and we know that he is everywhere represented as having founded Jerusalem. </p><p>Some by <em>the mountains </em>understand Moriah and Zion, <span class="cite-ref">(496)</span> which were the two tops of a mountain cleft into two, but this is too forced. As the country was mountainous, we are rather to understand the prophet as having in his eye the several neighboring and contiguous mountains which formed a chain around Jerusalem; for we will see in another place that Jerusalem was surrounded by mountains, (<span class="bvs">Psa_125:2</span>.) The true and natural meaning then is, that God chose the holy mountains in order to found and erect his city in the midst of them. For a little after, in the prosecution of the subject, these words occur, “The Highest himself shall establish her.” He is indeed the founder of other cities also; yet we do not read of him saying with respect to any other city, </p><p>“This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_132:14</span>.) </p><p>There is this difference, which is always to be remembered, that while other cities were founded and built by the guidance and power of God, merely for the sake of civil government, Jerusalem was his peculiar sanctuary, and his royal seat. Isaiah also uses a similar form of expression, (<span class="bvs">Isa_14:32</span>,) “The Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.” Besides, although the whole country of Judea was consecrated to God, yet he is said to have rejected all the other cities, and to have chosen this one for himself in which to reign. Here the question is not about earthly polity, but spiritual government; for the pure religion, and the true worship of God, and the doctrine of godliness, were at that time to be found nowhere but in Jerusalem. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(495)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il est advenu desja de pieca</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(496)</span> As examples of this, see <span class="bvs">2Sa_1:19</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_114:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Son_1:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Isa_23:1</span>; <span class="bvs">Jer_33:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Lam_3:1</span>; <span class="bvs">Nah_1:8</span>. </p></div></div>
