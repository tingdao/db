<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Behold, thou hast desired truth, etc. </em>This verse confirms the remark which we already made, that David was far from seeking to invent an apology for his sin, when he traced it back to the period of his conception, and rather intended by this to acknowledge that from his very infancy he was an heir of eternal death. He thus represents his whole life to have been obnoxious to condemnation. So far is he from imitating those who arraign God as the author of sin, and impiously suggest that he might have given man a better nature, that in the verse now before us he opposes God’s judgment to our corruption, insinuating, that every time we appear before him, we are certain of being condemned, inasmuch as we are born in sin, while he delights in holiness and uprightness. He goes further, and asserts, that in order to meet the approval of God, it is not enough that our lives be conformed to the letter of his law, unless our heart be clean and purified from all guile. He tells us that God desires truth in <em>the inward parts, </em><span class="cite-ref">(264)</span> intimating to us, that secret as well as outward and gross sins excite his displeasure. In the second clause of the verse, he aggravates his offense by confessing that he could not plead the excuse of ignorance. He had been sufficiently instructed by God in his duty. Some interpret <span class="lang he-il">בסתום</span>, <em>besathum, </em>as if he here declared that God had discovered secret mysteries to him, or things hidden from the human understanding. He seems rather to mean that wisdom had been discovered to his mind in a secret and intimate manner. <span class="cite-ref">(265)</span> The one member of the verse responds to the other. He acknowledges that it was not a mere superficial acquaintance with divine truth which he had enjoyed, but that it had been closely brought home to his heart. This rendered his offense the more inexcusable. Though privileged so highly with the saving knowledge of the truth, he had plunged into the commission of brutish sin, and by various acts of iniquity had almost ruined his soul. </p><p>We have thus set before us the exercise of the Psalmist at this time. First, we have seen that he is brought to a confession of the greatness of his offense: this leads him to a sense of the complete depravity of his nature: to deepen his convictions, he then directs his thoughts to the strict judgment of God, who looks not to the outward appearance but the heart; and, lastly, he adverts to the peculiarity of his case, as one who had enjoyed no ordinary measure of the gifts of the Spirit, and deserved on that account the severer punishment. The exercise is such as we should all strive to imitate. Are we conscious of having committed any one sin, let it be the means of recalling others to our recollection, until we are brought to prostrate ourselves before God in deep self-abasement. And if it has been our privilege to enjoy the special teaching of the Spirit of God, we ought to feel that our guilt is additionally heavy, having sinned in this case against light, and having trampled under foot the precious gifts with which we were intrusted. </p><p><strong>(264)</strong> The word <span class="lang he-il">טחות</span>, <em>tuchoth</em>, which is rendered <em>inward parts</em>, and which is derived from the verb <span class="lang he-il">טוח</span>, <em>tuach</em>, <em>to spread over</em>, means <em>the reins</em>, which are so called, because they are <em>overspread </em>with fat. “Once more it is used in Scripture, <span class="bvs">Job_38:36</span>, where, as here, our English Bible renders it <em>inward parts</em>, somewhat too generally. The Chaldee expresses it more particularly by <em>reins</em>, and these, in the Scripture style, are frequently taken for the seat of the affections, the purity whereof is most contrary to the natural corruption or inbred pollution spoken of in the preceding verse. The word <span class="lang he-il">אמת</span>, <em>emeth</em>, <em>truth</em>, ordinarily signifies sincerity, uprightness, and integrity; and so <em>truth in the reins </em>is equivalent to a hearty sincere obedience, not only of the actions, but of the very thoughts and affections to God; and so, in things of this nature, wherein this psalm is principally concerned, denotes the purity of the heart, the not admitting any unclean desire or thought, the very first degree of indulgence to any lust. And this God is said <em>to will</em>, or <em>desire</em>, or <em>delight in</em>, and so to command and require of us.” — <em>Hammond </em></p><p><strong>(265)</strong> The word is explained in the first of these senses in the Septuagint: “<span class="lang el-gr">Τὰ ἄδηλα καὶ τα κρύφια τὢς σοφίας εδήλοσίς μοι</span>;” — “Thou hast manifested to me the secret and hidden things of thy wisdom.” Viewed in this light as well as in the other, the language expresses the aggravated nature of David’s sin. He had sinned, although God had revealed to him high and secret mysteries. </p></div>
