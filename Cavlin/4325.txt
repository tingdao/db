<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>This is the water of Meribah. </em><span class="cite-ref">(110)</span> This name was given: to the place in order that the ingratitude of their fathers might be detestable to their descendants, and hence the mercy of God more illustrious. Thus the Prophet, referring to it, says: </p><p>“That the generation to come might know them, — that they might not forget the works of God, — and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_78:6</span>.) </p><p>And elsewhere both the name of Meribah and that of Massah are employed, in order that the Israelites might learn not to imitate their fathers, (<span class="bvs">Psa_95:8</span>; <span class="cite-ref">(111)</span>)although Moses here uses the plural number, whereas he has the singular in <span class="bvs">Exo_17:0</span>. </p><p>The expression at the end of the verse, that God “was sanctified” among the children of Israel, is not used in approval, but rather in reproof, of their conduct. Israel is called elsewhere God’s “holiness,” <span class="cite-ref">(112)</span> (<span class="bvs">Psa_114:2</span>,) because God magnificently displayed tits glory in their deliverance; but He is here said to have sanctified Himself in a different sense, because, by the overthrow of their iniquity and frowardness, He rescued his holy name from contempt. In fine, it was a proof of his inestimable mercy, that the water, which might have justly been destructive to them, was not only given to be the sustenance of their bodies, but also was converted into an aid for their salvation; for which reason Paul says that this was “spiritual drink.” (<span class="bvs">1Co_10:4</span>.) </p><p><strong>(110)</strong><em>Lat., </em>“These are the waters of strife.” See margin <em>A.V. </em></p><p><strong>(111)</strong> In <em>C.’s </em>translation of this verse he retains the proper names Meribah and Massah, which in <em>A.V. </em>are rendered, “in the <em>provocation, </em>and in the day of <em>temptation.” </em>See <em>C.
