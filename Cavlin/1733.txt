But now perhaps for the first time this distinction is made more evident to Pharaoh, whereas before the peculiar grace of God had not been known to him. From hence, however, it was more than plain, that mercies and punishments were in the power of the one God of Israel, so that He might spare His own people, and treat them kindly and paternally, whilst, on the other hand, He exercised vengeance against His enemies. Wherefore He adds, “to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord God in the midst of the earth.” There is all implied <em>antithesis </em>here, which casts down all idols, and exalts the God of Israel alone. But although “the earth” may be here taken for the whole habitable globe, it will be properly confined to Egypt, as if God affirmed that He was supreme in the midst of Egypt, or everywhere throughout all Egypt, which means the same. The expression which follows, although somewhat harsh, yet contains no ambiguity. God is said to have “put a redemption between his people and the Egyptians; <span class="cite-ref">(96)</span> because, as if He had erected barriers, or set up a fence to preserve one corner in safety, He had withholden His favor from the whole surrounding district. Moreover, because the word <span class="lang he-il">פלה</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(97)</span><em>phelo</em>, signifies to be admirable, or to be concealed, some interpreters translate it, “I will render admirable <span class="cite-ref">(98)</span> the land of Goshen;” but I have preferred following the more usual rendering which appears to be most appropriate. Lastly, it is to be observed that time for repentance is again given to Pharaoh, so that, if he were curable, he might prevent the punishment denounced against him: for God might have sent the insects at the moment; but He assigns the morrow, to prove the wickedness of the tyrant. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(96)</span> Verse 23, “And I will put a division,” <em>marg</em>. , “redemption.” — <em>A</em>. <em>V</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(97)</span><span class="lang he-il">פלה</span>, is <em>to separate</em>, <em>to distinguish by marks of </em>favor, <span class="lang he-il">פלא</span>, to be <em>wonderful</em>, or <em>inscrutable </em>The derivatives from these kindred roots are, however, not always.distinguishable; and in this instance <em>S M</em>. and the <em>V</em>. have rendered <span class="lang he-il">הפליתי</span>, as <em>C</em>. mentions, assuming it to be irregularly formed from <span class="lang he-il">פלא</span>. — <em>W </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(98)</span><em>French</em>, “miraculeuse.” </p></div></div>
