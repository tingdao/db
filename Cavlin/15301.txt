<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Look to me, and have pity upon me. </em>Here the Psalmist makes a more distinct application to himself of what he had said concerning the divine mercy and goodness. As God is merciful, he assures himself that his welfare will be the object of the divine care. The second verb in the verse, <span class="lang he-il">חנן</span>, <em>chanan, </em>which I have rendered <em>have pity, </em>signifies <em>to gratify, to do one a pleasure; </em>and is intended to convey the idea, that the succor which God affords to his people proceeds from his free goodness. <span class="cite-ref">(491)</span> Finally, the Psalmist concludes, that the only way in which he can be preserved is by the divine aid, which he seeks to obtain by prayer; and thus he confesses his utter destitution of any strength of his own. In applying to himself the appellation of <em>God’s servant, and the son of his handmaid, </em>he does not boast of his own services, but urges as a plea, for obtaining greater favor at the divine hand, the long line of his ancestors, and the continual course of God’s grace; setting forth, that he was from his mother’s womb a household-servant of God, and, as it were, born one of his servants in his house: <span class="cite-ref">(492)</span> a point of which we have already spoken elsewhere. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(491)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme si c’estoit un enfer plus haut, et qu’il y en eust un autre plus bas</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(492)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et est pour monstrer que le secours que Dieu donne aux siens, procede de sa bonte gratuite</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
