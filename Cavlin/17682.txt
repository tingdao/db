<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment </em>He confirms the same doctrine; and because the restoration of the Church was hard to be believed, he shows that it does not depend on the will of men, but is founded on the <em>justice </em>and <em>judgment </em>of God; as if he had said, that God will by no means permit his Church to be altogether destroyed, because he is <em>righteous</em>. The design of the Prophet, therefore, is to withdraw the minds of the godly from earthly thoughts, that in looking for the safety of the Church they may depend entirely on God, and not cease to entertain good hopes, although instead of aids they should see nothing but obstructions. It is a great mistake to consider <em>justice </em>and <em>judgment </em>to refer to the Church, as if Isaiah were speaking about the well-ordered condition of a city; for the plain meaning is what I have stated, that though men yield no assistance, the justice of God is fully sufficient for redeeming his Church. And, indeed, so long as we look at ourselves, what hope are we entitled to cherish? How many things, on the contrary, immediately present themselves that are fitted to weaken our faith! It is only in the justice of God that we shall find solid and lasting ground of confidence. </p><p><em>And they that return to her </em><span class="cite-ref">(30)</span> This second clause points out the manner of their deliverance; namely that the exiles, who had been widely dispersed, will again be gathered together. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(30)</span> In the English version it is rendered, <em>her converts</em>; but the marginal reading is, <em>And they that return of her</em>. “That is,” says Jarchi, “those who are in her (in the city of Zion) that repent.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
