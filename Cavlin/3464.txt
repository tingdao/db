<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And he that killeth any man</em>. We now proceed to the confirmation of the Sixth Commandment afforded by the Judicial Law; and first, the punishment of death is awarded to murderers. To “smite the life” <span class="cite-ref">(26)</span> is equivalent to wounding mortally, so that death ensues, as Moses more clearly explains himself in Exodus. But although he speaks briefly, like a legislator, there is no doubt but that he would have those whom he adjudges to die put to death by the sentence of the judges; the manner of executing the punishment we shall see in its proper place. Now although God did not carry out to absolute perfection the laws which He enacted, yet in their principle He desired that a clear and unreserved approval of His Commandments should appear. And this was the reason why I commenced with this passage, because it directly corresponds with the Sixth Commandment. <span class="cite-ref">(27)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(26)</span> See margin of <em>A</em>. <em>V</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(27)</span><em>Lat</em>. , “quia praecepto respondet quasi <span class="lang el-gr">ἀντίςροφος</span>.” </p></div></div>
