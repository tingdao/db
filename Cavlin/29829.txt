He again shews how earnestly desirous he is to transmit sound doctrine to posterity; and he exhorts Timothy, not only to preserve its shape and features, (as he formerly did,) but likewise to hand it down to godly teachers, that, being widely spread, it may take root in the hearts of many; for he saw that it would quickly perish if it were not soon scattered by the ministry of many persons. And, indeed, we see what Satan did, not long after the death of the Apostles; for, just as if preaching had been buried for some centuries, he brought in innumerable reveries, which, by their monstrous absurdity, surpassed the superstitions of all the heathens. We need not wonder, therefore, if Paul, in order to guard against an evil of such a nature and of such magnitude, earnestly desires that his doctrines shall be committed to all godly ministers, who shall be qualified to teach it. As if he had said, — “See that after my death there may remain a sure attestation of my doctrine; and this will be, if thou not only teach faithfully what thou hast learned from me, but take care that it be more widely published by others; therefore, whomsoever thou shalt see fitted for that work, commit to their trust this treasure.” </p><p><em>Commit to believing men </em>He calls them <em>believing men, </em>not on account of their faith, which is common to all Christians, but on account of their pre-eminence, as possessing a large measure of faith. We might even translate it “<em>faithful </em>men;” <span class="cite-ref">(156)</span> for there are few who sincerely labor to preserve and perpetuate the remembrance of the doctrine intrusted to them. Some are impelled by ambition, and that of various kinds, some by covetousness, some by malice, and others are kept back by the fear of dangers; and therefore extraordinary faithfulness is here demanded. </p><p><em>By many witnesses </em><span class="cite-ref">(157)</span> He does not mean that he produced witnesses in a formal and direct manner <span class="cite-ref">(158)</span> in the case of Timothy; but, because some might raise a controversy whether that which Timothy taught had proceeded from Paul, or had been forged by himself, he removes all doubt by this argument, that he did not speak secretly in a corner, but that there were many alive who could testify that Timothy spoke nothing which they had not formerly heard from the mouth of Paul. The doctrine of Timothy would therefore be beyond suspicion, seeing that they had many fellow-disciples, who could bear testimony to it. Hence we learn how greatly a servant of Christ should labor to maintain and defend the purity of doctrine, and not only while he lives, but as long as his care and labor can extend it. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(156)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Loyaux et digne auxquels on se fie</span>.” — “Faithful and trustworthy.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(157)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Entre plusieurs tenmoins, ou, en presence de plusieurs temoins</span>.” — “Among many witnesses, or, in presence of many witnesses.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(158)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ne vent pas dire qu’il ait appele des tesmoins, comme c’est la coustume es contrats et autres actes solennels</span>.” — “He does not mean that he called witnesses, as is customary in contracts and other solemn acts.” </p></div></div>
