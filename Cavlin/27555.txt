<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>Some mocked. </em>By this we see how great the carelessness of men is, whom neither the tribunal-seat of God, nor the majesty of the highest [supreme] Judge, doth make afraid, ( <span class="bvs">Act_26:23</span>.) We have said that this is a most sharp prick, wherewith men’s minds are pricked forward to fear God, when his judgment is set before their eyes; but there is such unspeakable hardness in the contemners, that they are not afraid to count that a fable or lie which is spoken concerning the giving of an account of our life once.<span class="cite-ref">(305)</span> Notwithstanding, there is no cause why the ministers of the gospel should omit.<span class="cite-ref">(306)</span> the preaching of the judgment which is enjoined them. Though the wicked do laugh and mock, yet this doctrine, which they go about to make of none effect, shall so gird them, that they shall at length perceive that they have striven in vain with their snare.<span class="cite-ref">(307)</span> And no marvel if this point of Paul’s doctrine were derided at Athens; for it is a mystery hid from men’s minds, whereon the chiefest philosophers did never think, neither can we otherwise comprehend it, than when we lift up the eyes of faith unto the infinite power of God. And yet Paul’s sermon was not altogether without fruit; because there were some of the hearers which were desirous to profit and go forward. For when they say that they will hear him again, their meaning is, that though they were not as yet thoroughly persuaded, yet had they some taste, which did provoke them to be desirous to profit. Surely this desire was contrary to loathsomeness.<span class="cite-ref">(308)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(305)</span></p><p>“ De reddenda semel vitae ratione,” about one day rendering an account of our lives. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(306)</span></p><p>“ Supersedant,” supersede. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(307)</span></p><p>“ Laqueo,” snare or fetter. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(308)</span></p><p>“ Fastidio,” fastidiousness or disdain. </p></div></div>
