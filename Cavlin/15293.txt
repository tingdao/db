<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord! </em>Here the Psalmist may be considered either as bursting forth into thanksgivings, after having obtained what he desired, or else as gathering courage and new strength for prayer. The latter opinion I am most inclined to adopt; but perhaps it may be preferable to regard both views as included. Some understand the word <span class="lang he-il">אלהום</span>, <em>Elohim, </em>as denoting <em>angels </em>— <em>There is none like unto thee, O Lord! among the angels </em>— as if David compared them with the Most High God; but this does not seem to agree so well with the passage. He does not humble the angels, representing them as inferior gods, that they may give place to the power of God; but he holds up to contempt and derision all the false gods in whom the heathen world imagined some help was to be found; <span class="cite-ref">(484)</span> and he does this because they could supply no evidence of their being gods from their works. Had he distributed the power of working between them and the true God in different degrees, assigning less to the former and more to the latter, he would not have attributed to God that which is naturally and exclusively his own. He therefore affirms, without qualification, that no characteristic of Deity could be perceived in them, or traced in any works performed by them. In calling us to the consideration of works, he clearly shows, that those who indulge in ingenious speculations about the occult or secret essence of God, and pass over the unequivocal traces of his majesty which are to be seen beaming forth in bright effulgence in his works, do but trifle and spend their time to no purpose. As the Divine nature is infinitely exalted above the comprehension of our understanding, David wisely confines his attention to the testimony of God’s works, and declares that the gods who put forth no power are false and counterfeit. If it is objected that there is no comparison between God and the silly inventions of men, the answer is obvious, That this language is employed in accommodation to the ignorance of the generality of men. The effrontery with which the superstitious exalt the spurious fabrications of their own brain above the heavens is well known; and David very justly derides their madness in forging gods to themselves, which in reality are no gods. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(484)</span> The word for “and propitious” is <span class="lang he-il">וסלח</span>, <em>vesallach</em>, which Bythner renders, “and a pardoner.” It is from <span class="lang he-il">סלח</span>, <em>salach</em>, <em>he forgave</em>, <em>pardoned </em></p></div></div>
