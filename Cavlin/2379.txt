<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>42.</strong><em>At the door of the tabernacle </em><span class="cite-ref">(235)</span><em>of the congregation. </em>This passage shews us in what sense the word <span class="lang he-il">מועד</span><em>mogned, </em>is used, when it is employed in connection with the tabernacle. Some translate it “testimony:” others, “church:” others, “assembly,” (<em>conventum;</em>) others, “appointment,” (<em>constitutum;</em>) but its etymology is sufficiently shewn in this passage; for, when Moses gives the reason of its appellation, he uses the word <span class="lang he-il">יגד</span><em>yagnad, </em>from whence it is derived. What, then, is the tabernacle of the convention? God Himself answers, that it is the place which He has chosen and appointed unto His people, that they may there mutually come to agreement with <em>each </em>other. Some conceive its root to be, <span class="lang he-il">עדה</span><em>gnadah, </em>which is to make protestation as by a solemn rite; but since this is opposed to grammar, I will take what is certain. The word <span class="lang he-il">יעד</span><em>yagnad, </em>in this construction, means to contract or agree with another, or at least to meet for the transaction of mutual business; no word, therefore, has appeared to me more nearly equivalent to it than <em>convention; </em>for the fact that God invited them to familiar colloquy, was of the greatest weight in preserving the modest reverence of the faithful towards the priests. In the next verse He repeats to them, addressing them in the third person, that whosoever shall desire to be reckoned among the Israelites, should not turn away or wander elsewhere; for a law is laid down for all the children of Israel, that they should seek God there. Another confirmation is subjoined, <em>i.e., </em>that this place ought to be sanctified, because God will there magnificently display His glory. In fine, from the whole passage, it appears that God’s design was to keep the people bound to Him by the tie of the Levitical priesthood; yet we must observe that it is God alone who sanctifies both the place and the offerings, as well as the men themselves. Wherefore frivolous is the boast of those who arrogate more than God has conferred upon them. If we believe the Pope, in him is the holiness of holiness; yet, since he does not produce God’s authority for this, but vaunts himself of titles invented without foundation, we may safely laugh at his stupid impudence. But from this and similar passages, our doctrine is taken that Christ ought not to be estimated humanly, but according to His heavenly and divine power. Hence, too, is refuted the boast of the Popish priests that they offer Christ; for we must always ask them, By what authority? since God claims for Himself alone this right of sanctifying those who exercise the lawful priesthood. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(235)</span> “Conventionis :” of the convention. — <em>Lat</em>. </p></div></div>
