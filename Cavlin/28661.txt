<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>But ye are the body of Christ </em>Hence what has been said respecting the nature and condition of the human body must be applied to us; for we are not a mere civil society, but, being ingrafted into Christ’s body, are truly members one of another. Whatever, therefore, any one of us has, let him know that it has been given him for the edification of his brethren in common; and let him, accordingly, bring it forward, and not keep it back — buried, as it were, within himself, or make use of it as his own. Let not the man, who is endowed with superior gifts, be puffed up with pride, and despise others; but let him consider that there is nothing so diminutive as to be of no use — as, in truth, even the least among the pious brings forth fruit, according to his slender capacity, so that there is no useless member in the Church. Let not those who are not endowed with so much honor, envy those above them, or refuse to do their duty to them, but let them maintain the station in which they have been placed. Let there be mutual affection, mutual <em>fellow-feeling, ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">συμπάθεια</span><em>,) </em>mutual concern. Let us have a regard to the common advantage, in order that we may not destroy the Church by malignity, or envy, or pride, or any disagreement; but may, on the contrary, every one of us, strive to the utmost of his power to preserve it. Here is a large subject, and a magnificent one; <span class="cite-ref">(762)</span> but I content myself with having pointed out the way in which the above similitude must be applied to the Church. </p><p><em>Members severally. </em>Chrysostom is of opinion, that this clause is added, because the Corinthians were not the universal Church; but this appears to me rather forced. <span class="cite-ref">(763)</span> I have sometimes thought that it was expressive of impropriety, as the Latins say <em>Quodammodo </em><em>, </em><span class="cite-ref">(764)</span><em>(in a manner.) </em><span class="cite-ref">(765)</span> When, however, I view the whole matter more narrowly, I am rather disposed to refer it to that division of members of which he had made mention. They are then <em>members severally, </em>according as <em>each </em>one has had his portion and definite work assigned him. The context itself leads us to this meaning. In this way <em>severally, </em>and <em>as a whole, </em>will be opposite terms. </p><p><strong>(762)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Voyci vne belie matiere riche et abondante</span>;” — “Here is a fine subject, rich and copious.” </p><p><strong>(763)</strong> It is remarked by <em>Billroth</em>, that “the view of Chrysostom is out of place; for such a notion does not pertain to the argumentation of the Apostle.” Biblical Cabinet, No. 22. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(764)</strong> An instance of this will be found in <em>Cicero de Amicitia</em>, 8. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(765)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme nous disons en Langue vulgaire, Aucunement</span>;” — “As we say, in common language — In a manner.” </p></div>
