<div class="comment-content"><p>I was constrained yesterday to leave unfinished the words of the Prophet. He said that the children were <em>worse </em>than their fathers, and gave the reason, <em>Because they followed the wickedness of their evil heart, and hearkened not to God </em>He seems to have said before the same thing of the fathers: it might then be asked, Why does he say that the children had done worse than their fathers, and pronounce their sins worse? Now we have already seen that sins became worse before God, when the children strengthened themselves in wickedness by following the examples of their fathers. We must also notice, that not only the law had been set before them, but that also Prophets had been often sent to them, who added their reproofs: and this is what Jeremiah seems to have expressed at the end of the verse, by saying that they <em>hearkened not, </em>though daily spoken to by the Prophets. It was then their obstinacy that God so severely punished: they had imitated their wicked fathers, and then they not only had despised, but also through their obstinate wickedness had rejected all the warnings which the Prophets gave them. </p></div>
