<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>The fear of Jehovah </em>Having treated of the kindness of God, and paid a well-merited tribute to the law, the prophet goes on to exhort the faithful to reverence God, and be zealous in the keeping of the law. In calling <em>the fear of God, The beginning or source of wisdom, </em>he charges with folly those who do not render implicit obedience unto God. As if he should say, They who fear not God, and do not regulate their lives according to his law, are brute beasts: and are ignorant of the first elements of true wisdom. To this we must carefully attend; for although mankind generally wish to be accounted wise almost all the world lightly esteem God, and take pleasure in their own wicked craftiness. And as the very worst of men are reputed to be superior to all others in point of wisdom; and, puffed up with this confidence, harden themselves against God, the prophet declares all the wisdom of the world, without the fear of God, to be vanity or an empty shadow. And, indeed, all who are ignorant of the purpose for which they live are fools and madmen. But to serve God is the purpose for which we have been born, and for which we are preserved in life. There is, therefore, no worse blindness, no insensibility so grovelling, as when we contemn God, and place our affections elsewhere. For whatever ingenuity the wicked may possess, they are destitute of the main thing, genuine piety. To the same effect are the words which immediately follow,<em>a good understanding have all they who keep God’s commandments. </em>There is great emphasis upon the qualifying adjunct <span class="lang he-il">טוב</span>, <em>tob; </em>because the prophet, in inveighing against the foolish opinion to which we have already adverted, tacitly condemns those who delight in their own wicked craftiness. His meaning is, I admit, that they are usually deemed wise who look well to their own interests, who can pursue a temporising policy, who have the acuteness and artifice of preserving the favorable opinion of the world, and who even practice deception upon others. But even were I to grant that this character belongs to them, yet is their wisdom unprofitable and perverse, because true wisdom manifests itself in the observance of the law. Next he substitutes the <em>keeping of God’s commandments </em>for the fear of God. For though all men, without exception, boast that they fear God, yet nothing is more common than for them to live in the neglect of his law. Hence the prophet very properly inculcates upon us the voluntary assumption of his yoke, and submission to the regulations of his word, as the most satisfactory evidence of our living in the fear of God. The term <em>beginning </em><span class="cite-ref">(340)</span> has misled some, leading them to imagine that the fear of God was denominated the entrance of wisdom, as it were the alphabet, because it prepares men for true piety. Such an opinion is scarcely deserving of notice, seeing that, in <span class="bvs">Job_28:28</span>, it is called “wisdom.” In this passage fear is not to be understood as referring to the first or elementary principles of piety, as in <span class="bvs">1Jo_4:18</span>, but is comprehensive of all true godliness, or the worship of God. The conclusion of the psalm requires no explanation; it being the object of the prophet simply to inculcate upon the faithful, that nothing is more profitable for them, than to spend their lives in the celebration of the praises of God. </p><p><strong>(340)</strong> “<em>The beginning, </em>— the word, so translated, also signifies <em>the prime, the chief part, the perfection</em>; a sense which it may very well bear in this place: comp. <span class="bvs">Deu_10:12</span> ” — <em>Cresswell. </em>“<span class="lang he-il">ראשית</span> this word may signify, the first in time, and so it may denote the foundation of any thing; hence the meaning of the Psalmist here is, that the foundation of all wisdom is the fear of the Lord. But <span class="lang he-il">ראשית</span> has also the sense of being <em>first </em>in <em>dignity, </em>as well as in order of time; thus <span class="lang he-il">ראשית חכמה</span><em>, wisdom is the chief thing, </em><span class="bvs">Pro_4:7</span>. Here it may be understood in the same manner; <em>i.e</em>. , the fear of the Lord is the chief wisdom.” — <em>Phillips. </em></p></div>
