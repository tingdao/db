<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>43.</strong><em>Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people. </em>The appositive reading, which some prefer, “Praise him, O nations, His people,” supplying the word “God,” is constrained. For there is no incongruity in the notion that the Gentiles should celebrate the benefits which God has conferred upon His people; at any rate, it is more simple to take it thus, that so conspicuous was the favor of God towards the Israelites, that the knowledge and favor of it should diffuse itself far and wide, and be renowned even among the Gentiles. For Scripture thus magnifies some of the more memorable exertions of God’s power, especially when reference is made to the redemption of the elect people, and commands His praise to be proclaimed among the nations, since it would be by no means fitting that it should be confined within the narrow limits of Judea. A question, however, occurs, because Paul seems to quote this passage differently; for he says, “Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people,” (<span class="bvs">Rom_15:10</span>;) and undoubtedly the word <span class="lang he-il">נקם</span><em>, nakam, </em>which Moses uses, also signifies to rejoice. <span class="cite-ref">(299)</span> If we admit that Paul took this sentence from Moses, the same Spirit, who spoke both by Moses and Paul, is the best interpreter of His own words; nor will it be inconsistent that the Gentiles should rejoice at the felicity of God’s people. But it may have been the case that Paul did not take this testimony from any particular place, but from the general teaching of Scripture. At any rate, the dignity of the people is celebrated on the ground that God esteems their blood precious, and will deem their persecutors His own adversaries. </p><p>The word <span class="lang he-il">כפר</span><em>, capbar, at </em>the end of the verse, some render to <em>expiate, </em>others, to <em>be propitious, </em>which is the rendering I have preferred, although I do not reject the former meaning. The verb <span class="lang he-il">כפר</span><em>, caphar, </em>signifies that an expiation is made with sacrifice to appease God; and it is probable that Moses alludes to the legal mode of reconciliation; nevertheless, in my judgment, he means that God will restore His land and people to His favor. </p><p><strong>(299)</strong> It would scarcely be conceded now that <span class="lang he-il">נקם</span> ever means to rejoice. — <em>W </em></p></div>
