<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Buried with him, in baptism. </em>He explains still more clearly the manner of spiritual circumcision — because, being <em>buried with Christ</em>, we are partakers of his death. He expressly declares that we obtain this by means of baptism, that it may be the more clearly apparent that there is no advantage from circumcision under the reign of Christ. For some one might otherwise object: “Why do you abolish circumcision on this pretext — that its accomplishment is in Christ? Was not Abraham, also, circumcised spiritually, and yet this did not hinder the adding of the sign to the reality? <em>Outward </em>circumcision, therefore, is not superfluous, although that which is <em>inward </em>is conferred by Christ.” Paul anticipates an objection of this kind, by making mention of baptism. Christ, says he, accomplishes in us spiritual circumcision, not through means of that ancient sign, which was in force under Moses, but by baptism. Baptism, therefore, is a sign of the thing that is presented to us, which while absent was prefigured by circumcision. The argument is taken from the economy <span class="cite-ref">(374)</span> which God has appointed; for those who retain circumcision contrive a mode of dispensation different from that which God has appointed. </p><p>When he says that we are <em>buried with Christ</em>, this means more than that we are <em>crucified </em>with him; for burial expresses a continued process of mortification. When he says, that this is done through means of baptism, as he says also in <span class="bvs">Rom_6:4</span>, he speaks in his usual manner, ascribing efficacy to the sacrament, that it may not fruitlessly signify what does not exist. <span class="cite-ref">(375)</span> By baptism, therefore, we are <em>buried with Christ</em>, because Christ does at the same time accomplish efficaciously that mortification, which he there represents, that the reality may be conjoined with the sign. </p><p><em>In which also ye are risen. </em>He magnifies the grace which we obtain in Christ, as being greatly superior to circumcision. “We are not only,” says he, “ingrafted into Christ’s death, but we also rise to newness of life:” hence the more injury is done to Christ by those who endeavor to bring us back to circumcision. He adds, <em>by faith</em>, for unquestionably it is by it that we receive what is presented to us in baptism. But what <em>faith </em>? That of his <em>efficacy </em>or <em>operation</em>, by which he means, that faith is founded upon the power of God. As, however, faith does not wander in a confused and undefined contemplation, as they speak, of divine power, he intimates what <em>efficacy </em>it ought to have in view — that by which <em>God raised Christ from the dead</em>. He takes this, however, for granted, that, inasmuch as it is impossible that believers should be severed from their head, the same power of God, which shewed itself in Christ, is diffused among them all in common. </p><p><strong>(374)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Du gouuernement et dispensation que Dieu a ordonné en son Eglise</span>;” — “From the government and dispensation which God has appointed in his Church.” </p><p><strong>(375)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin que la, signification ne soit vaine, comme d’vne chose qui n’est point</span>;” — “That the signification may not be vain, as of a thing that is not.” </p></div>
