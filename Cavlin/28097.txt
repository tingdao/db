And he ascribes <em>newness </em>to the Spirit, because it succeeds the <em>old </em>man; as the letter is called <em>old</em>, because it perishes through the regeneration of the Spirit. </p><p><strong>(207)</strong> That the moral, and not the ceremonial law, is meant here, is incontestably evident from what the Apostle adds in the following verses. He quotes the moral law in the next verse; he calls this law, in <span class="bvs">Rom_7:10</span>, the commandment<span class="lang el-gr">, την ἐντολὴν, </span> which was unto life, see <span class="bvs">Mat_19:16</span>; and he says, that “by it” sin “slew” him, which could not have been said of the ceremonial law. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(208)</strong> Our common version is evidently incorrect as to this clause. The pronoun<span class="lang el-gr">αὐτῷ </span> or <span class="lang el-gr">ἐκεινῷ, </span> is to be supplied. There is an exactly similar ellipsis in <span class="bvs">Rom_6:21</span> [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] and several others, as well as our version, have followed a reading<span class="lang el-gr">, αποθανοντὀ, </span> which [<span class="bvs">Griesbach </span>] disregards as of no authority; and it is inconsistent with the usual phraseology of the Apostle. See <span class="bvs">Rom_7:4</span>, and <span class="bvs">Gal_2:19</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
