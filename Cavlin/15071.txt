<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Arise, O God! plead thy cause. </em>The pious Jews again supplicate God to ascend into his judgment-seat. He is then said <em>to arise, </em>when, after having long exercised forbearance, he shows, in very deed, that he has not forgotten his office as judge. To induce him to undertake this cause the more readily, they call upon him to maintain his own right. Lord, as if they had said, since the matter in hand is what peculiarly concerns thyself; it is not time for thee to remain inactive. They declare, at the same time, how this was, in a special sense, the cause of God. It was so, because the foolish people daily cast reproaches upon him. We may here again translate the word <span class="lang he-il">נבל</span>, <em>nabal, the worthless people, </em>instead of <em>the foolish people. </em>The wickedness charged against the persons spoken of is aggravated from the circumstance, that, not content with reproaching God on one occasion, they continued their derision and mockery without intermission. For this reason, the faithful conclude by invoking God that he would not forget such heaven-daring conduct in men who not only had the audacity to reproach his majesty, but who fiercely and outrageously poured forth their blasphemies against him. They seemed, it is true, to do this indirectly; but, as they despised God, it is asserted that they <em>rose up against him </em>with reckless and infatuated presumption, after the manner of the Giants of old, and that their haughtiness was carried to the greatest excess. </p></div>
