<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>And above all things </em>He commends charity or love as the first thing, for it is the bond of perfection. And he bids it to be <em>fervent, </em>or intense, or vehement, which is the same thing; for whosoever is immoderately fervent in self-love, loves others coldly. And he commends it on account of its fruit, because it buries innumerable sins, than which nothing is more desirable. But the sentence is taken from Solomon, whose words are found in <span class="bvs">Pro_10:12</span>, </p><p>“Hatred discovers reproaches, but love covers a multitude of sins.” </p><p>What Solomon meant is sufficiently clear, for the two clauses contain things which are set in contrast the one with the other. As then he says in the first clause that hatred is the cause why men traduce and defame one another, and spread whatever is reproachful and dishonorable; so it follows that a contrary effect is ascribed to love, that is, that men who love one another, kindly and courteously forgive one another; hence it comes that, willingly burying each other’s vices, one seeks to preserve the honor of another. <span class="cite-ref">(47)</span> Thus Peter confirms his exhortation, that nothing is more necessary than to cherish mutual love. For who is there that has not many faults? Therefore all stand in need of forgiveness, and there is no one who does not wish to be forgiven. </p><p>This singular benefit love brings to us when it exists among us, so that innumerable evils are covered in oblivion. On the other hand, where loose reins are given to hatred, men by mutual biting and tearing must necessarily consume one another, as Paul says (<span class="bvs">Gal_5:15</span>.) </p><p>And it ought to be noticed that Solomon does not say that only a few sins are covered, but a multitude of sins, according to what Christ declares, when he bids us to forgive our brethren seventy times seven, (<span class="bvs">Mat_18:22</span>.) But the more sins love covers, the more evident appears its usefulness for the wellbeing of mankind. </p><p>This is the plain meaning of the words. It hence appears how absurd are the Papists, who seek to elicit from this passage their own satisfactions, as though almsgiving and other duties of charity were a sort of a compensation to God for blotting out their sins. <span class="cite-ref">(48)</span> It is enough to point out by the way their gross ignorance, for in a matter so clear it would be superfluous to add many words. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(47)</span> The quotation is from the Hebrew, and the sentence in the <em>Sept. </em>is evidently different. The same words are found also in <span class="bvs">Jas_5:20</span>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(48)</span> ”Though charity, or benevolence, hides the faults of <em>others </em>from the severity of our censure, yet charity or almsgiving is totally unable to conceal <em>our own </em>from the observance of our all-righteous Judge. Indeed, the only cover for these, or to speak more properly, the discharge of all their stains, is <em>faith</em>, — is the <em>blood </em>of Christ, working with repentance towards God.” — <em>Bishop Warburton, </em>quoted by <em>Bloomfield. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
