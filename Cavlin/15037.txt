<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Although I applied my mind to know this. </em>The first verb <span class="lang he-il">חשב</span>,<em>chashab, </em>which he employs, properly signifies <em>to reckon </em>or <em>count, </em>and sometimes <em>to consider </em>or <em>weigh. </em>But the words which follow in the sentence require the sense which I have given, That he applied his mind to know the part of Divine Providence referred to. He has already condemned himself for having transgressed; but still he acknowledges, that until he entered into the sanctuaries of God, he was not altogether disentangled from the doubts with which his mind had been perplexed. In short, he intimates that he had reflected on this subject on all sides, and yet, by all his reasoning upon it, could not comprehend how God, amidst so great disorders and confusions, continued to govern the world. Moreover, in speaking thus of himself, he teaches us, that when men are merely under the guidance of their own understandings, the inevitable consequence is, that they sink under their trouble, not being able by their own deliberations and reasonings to arrive at any certain or fixed conclusions; for there is no doubt that he puts <em>the sanctuaries of God </em>in opposition to carnal reason. Hence it follows, that all the knowledge and wisdom which men have of their own is vain and unsubstantial; since all true wisdom among men — all that deserves to be so called — consists in this one point, <span class="cite-ref">(188)</span> That they are docile, and implicitly submit to the teaching of the Word of God. The Psalmist does not speak of unbelievers who are wilfully blind, who involve themselves in errors, and are also very glad to find some color or pretext for taking offense, that they may withdraw to a distance from God. It is of himself that he speaks; and although he applied his mind to the investigation of divine subjects, not only earnestly, but with all humility; and although, at the same time, he contemplated, according to his small measure, the high judgments of God, not only with attention, but also with reverence, yet he confesses that he failed of success; for the word <em>trouble </em><span class="cite-ref">(189)</span> here implies unprofitable or lost labor. Whoever, therefore, in applying himself to the examination of God’s judgments, expects to become acquainted with them by his natural understanding, will be disappointed, and will find that he is engaged in a task at once painful and profitless; and, therefore, it is indispensably necessary to rise higher, and to seek illumination from heaven. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(188)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’autant que toute la vraye sagesse qui doit estre ainsi nommee es hommes, consiste en un seul poinct</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(189)</span> Green translates the Hebrew word for this, “hard;” Horsley, “perplexing;” and Boothroyd, “difficult.” </p></div></div>
