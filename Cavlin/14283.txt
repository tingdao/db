<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Gather not my soul with wicked men. </em>Having now affirmed his innocence, he has recourse again to prayer, and calls upon God to defend him. At first sight, indeed, it appears strange to pray that God would not involve a righteous man in the same destruction with the wicked; but God, with paternal indulgence, allows this freedom in prayer, that his people may themselves in this way correct their anxieties, and overcome the fears with which they are tempted. David, when he conceived this supplication, in order to free himself from anxiety and fear, placed before his eyes the righteous judgment of God, to whom nothing is more abhorrent than to mingle good and bad together without distinction. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">אספ</span>, <em>asaph, </em>sometimes signifies <em>to gather together, </em>and sometimes <em>to destroy. </em>In this place, I am of opinion it signifies to <em>gather into a heap, </em>as was wont to be the case in a confused slaughter. This was the objection stated by Abraham, </p><p>“That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee.” (<span class="bvs">Gen_18:25</span>,) </p><p>Let us remember, therefore, that these forms of prayer are dictated by the Holy Spirit, in order that the faithful may unhesitatingly assure themselves that God still sits in inquisition upon every man’s case, in order to give righteous judgment at last. In the second clause, instead of the phrase, <em>wicked men, </em>he uses <em>bloody men, </em>amplifying what he had said. For although many wicked men rush not all at once to murder, yet in process of time they harden themselves to cruelty; nor does Satan allow them to rest until he precipitate them into deeds of blood. </p></div>
