<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And it came to pass on the twentieth day </em>Moses records that after leaving Mount Sinai, the camp was first pitched in the wilderness of Paran; and although the distance was not great, — being, as we shall soon see, a three days’ journey, — still the fatigue was sufficient to harass and weary the people. It is mentioned in praise of their obedience that they were expeditious in setting forth “according to the commandment of God;” but presently, through failure of the spirit of perseverance, their levity and inconstancy betrayed itself. </p><p>When it is said that “they journeyed by their journeyings,” <em>(profectos esse per suas profectiones,) </em>it refers to their whole progress through the desert. As to the word, I know not why Jerome translated it <em>turmas, </em>(troops,) for its root; is the verb <span class="lang he-il">נסע</span><em>nasang, </em>which is used with it; and according to its constant use in Scripture, it plainly means stations, <span class="cite-ref">(427)</span> or halting-places. We say in Frealch <em>journees, </em>or <em>gistes. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(427)</span> “Stationibus, vel auspiciis;” the latter being evidently a misprint for <em>hospitiis. </em>— <em>Lat. “Gistum, </em>hospitium, susceptio; Gall, <em>giste; </em>jus, quod dominis feudalibus competebat in vassallorum suorum praediis, qui staffs ae condietis vicibus eos in domibus suis hospitio, et conviviis excipere tenebantur. Quod quidem jus <em>Mansionaticum </em>sub prima et secunda Regum Francorum stirpe, sub tertia vero <em>Gistum, Procuratio, Coenaticum, Comestio, Pastus, Prandium </em>dictum suis locis observamus.” — Adelung’s Du Cange. </p></div></div>
