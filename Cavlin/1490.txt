<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Dan shall judge his people. </em>In the word <em>judge </em>there is an allusion to his name: for since, among the Hebrews, <span class="lang he-il">דון</span> (<em>din</em>) signifies to judge, Rachel, when she returned thanks to God, gave this name to the son born to her by her handmaid, as if God had been the vindicator of her cause and right. Jacob now gives a new turn to the meaning of the name; namely, that the sons of Dan shall have no mean part in the government of the people. For the Jews foolishly restrict it to Samson, because he alone presided over the whole people, whereas the language rather applies to the perpetual condition of the tribe. Jacob therefore means, that though Dan was born from a concubine, he shall still be one of the judges of Israel: because not only shall his offspring possess a share of the government and command, in the common polity, so that this tribe may constitute one head; but it shall be appointed the bearer of a standard to lead the fourth division of the camp of Israel. <span class="cite-ref">(210)</span> In the second place, his subtle disposition is described. For Jacob compares this people to serpents, who rise out of their lurking-places, by stealth, against the unwary whom they wish to injure. The sense then is, that he shall not be so courageous as earnestly and boldly to engage in open conflict; but that he will fight with cunning, and will make use of snares. Yet, in the meantime, he shows that he will be superior to his enemies, whom he does not dare to approach with collected forces, just as serpents who, by their secret bite, cast down the horse and his rider. In this place also no judgment is expressly passed, whether this subtlety of Dan is to be deemed worthy of praise or of censure: but conjecture rather inclines us to place it among his faults, or at least his disadvantages, that instead of opposing himself in open conflict with his enemies, he will fight them only with secret frauds. <span class="cite-ref">(211)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(210)</span> See <span class="bvs">Num_2:0</span>, where the order of the tribes in their encampment is given. Judah had the standard for the three tribes on the east, Reuben for the three tribes on the south, Ephriam for the three tribes on the west, and Dan for the remaining three tribes on the north of the tabernacle. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(211)</span> The word <span class="lang he-il">שפיפון</span>, (<em>sheppiphon</em>,) translated “adder,” occurs only in this place. It is supposed by Bochart to be the cerastes, “a serpent so called,” says Calmet, “because it has horns on its forehead.” <em>Dr. A. Clarke </em>gives this translation: </p><p>“Dan shall be a serpent on the way, <LineBreak />A cerastes upon the track, <LineBreak />Biting the heels of the horse, <LineBreak />And his rider shall fall backwards.” </p><p>— <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
