<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>O God! the proud are risen up against me. </em>Instead of <span class="lang he-il">זדים</span><em>, zedim, the proud, </em>some read, <span class="lang he-il">זרים</span>, <em>zarim, strangers; </em>and, undoubtedly, the Scriptures often employ this word to denote barbarous cruelty, so that it is the same as if it had been said, <em>the cruel. </em>I, however, prefer following the generally received reading. As between the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">זדים</span>, <em>zedim, the proud, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">זרים</span>, <em>zarim, strangers, </em>there is only the difference of a single letter, the one having the letter <span class="lang he-il">ד</span>, <em>daleth, </em>where the other has the letter <span class="lang he-il">ר</span>, <em>resh, </em>it is obvious that, from the similarity of these two letters, the former might easily have been changed into the latter. Besides, the word, <em>proud, </em>agrees better with the scope of the passage; for, in the same sense, the Psalmist immediately after applies the epithet, <em>strong, </em>to those who, with headlong impetuosity and fierceness, rushed upon him to destroy him; and we know that where pride reigns no moderation is observed. He expresses without figure what he had just now said respecting the grave. Being as a lamb in the midst of wolves, he would have been quickly swallowed up, had not God miraculously delivered him, as it were, from the jaws of death. In representing his enemies as having no regard to God, he means to set forth the extreme excess of their cruelty. The fury of our lusts, unless we are restrained by the fear of God and the sense of his judgment, will become so great as to dare any thing, however atrocious. For these calamities he seeks a remedy, in the Divine mercy, in the following verse. </p></div>
