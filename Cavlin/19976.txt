They might then have easily obtained pardon from King Nebuchadnezzar; but as no fear of God prevailed in them, they did not consider what was lawful, and were by a blind impulse led into Egypt. Thus fear was no alleviation to their crime, for there was another remedy at hand, which God would have blessed. But when they disregarded Godâ€™s word, and followed what their own feelings dictated to them, they contrived in a very bad way for themselves. But far worse is what follows. </p></div>
