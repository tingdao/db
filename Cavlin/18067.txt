<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>This is revealed. </em><span class="cite-ref">(88)</span> As if he had said, “Do you think that you can escape punishment for your wantonness, when God calls you to repentance?” It might be thought that here the Prophet says nothing that is new; for undoubtedly all things are known to God. But he adds this for the purpose of shaking off the indolence of men, who never would rise so fiercely against God, if they did not think that they could deceive him; for whosoever knows that God is his witness, must also acknowledge that God is his judge. Hence it follows that wicked men, in their wantonness, rob God of his power; and therefore it is not without reason that they are summoned to his tribunal, that they may know that they must render an account to him. </p><p><em>If this iniquity shall be forgiven you till you die. </em>He adds a dreadful threatening, that this wickedness shall never be forgiven. In the Hebrew language, the conditional particle, <em>if</em>, contains a denial, as if the Lord had said, “Do not think that I am true, or that I have any divine perfections, <em>if </em>I do not take vengeance on so great wickedness.” The reason why the Jews, in their oaths, reserve something which is not expressed, is to accustom us to deeper reverence in this matter; for we entreat God to be our Judge and avenger if we speak falsely, and therefore we ought to restrain ourselves, so as not to make oaths at random. Here Isaiah states generally, that nothing is so displeasing to God as impenitence, by which, as Paul says, (<span class="bvs">Rom_2:5</span>,) we “heap up for ourselves the treasures of God’s wrath,” and shut out all hope of pardon. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(88)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
