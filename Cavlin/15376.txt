<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>49.</strong><em>O Lord! where are thy former mercies? </em>The prophet encourages himself, by calling to remembrance God’s former benefits, as if his reasoning were, That God can never be unlike himself, and that therefore the goodness which he manifested in old time to the fathers cannot come to an end. This comparison might indeed make the godly despond, when they find that they are not dealt with by him so gently as he dealt with the fathers, did not another consideration at the same time present itself to their minds — the consideration that he never changes, and never wearies in the course of his beneficence. As to the second clause of the verse, some interpreters connect it with the first, by interposing the relative, thus: — <em>Where are thy former mercies </em>which <em>thou hast sworn? </em>In this I readily acquiesce; for the sense is almost the same, although the relative be omitted. God had given evident and indubitable proofs of the truth of the oracle delivered to Samuel; <span class="cite-ref">(559)</span> and, therefore, the faithful lay before him both his promise and the many happy fruits of it which had been experienced. They say, <em>in truth, </em>that they may with the greater confidence apply to themselves, whatever tokens of his liberality God had in old time bestowed upon the fathers; for they had the same ground to expect the exercise of the Divine goodness towards them as the fathers had, God, who is unchangeably the same, having sworn to be merciful to the posterity of David throughout all ages. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(559)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sur les asnes et chevaux, et autres bestes brutes</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “To asses and horses, and other brute beasts.” </p></div></div>
