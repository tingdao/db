<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And Zaccheus stood, and said. </em>From this result they ought to have formed their opinion of what Christ did; but men are so hasty and precipitate, that they do not take time to wait for God. <span class="cite-ref">(680)</span> The conversion of Zaceheus is described by fruits and outward signs. As it was probable that he had enriched himself to the injury of others, </p><p>if he had wronged any man, he was ready to restore fourfold. Besides, the half of his goods he dedicates to the poor. A man might indeed bestow all his goods on the poor, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_13:3</span>,) </p><p>and yet his generosity might be of no value in the sight of God; but, though no mention is here made of inward repentance, yet Luke means that the godly zeal, which he commends in <em>Zaccheus</em>, proceeded from that living root. In like manner, Paul, when treating of repentance, exhorts us to those duties, by which men may learn that we are changed for the better. </p><p>Let him that stole steal no more; but rather let him labor with his hands, that he may assist the poor and needy, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Eph_4:28</span>.) </p><p>We ought therefore to begin with the heart, but our repentance ought also to be evinced by works. </p><p>Now let us observe that <em>Zaccheus </em>does not make a present to God out of his extortions, as many rich men give to God a portion of what they have obtained by dishonesty, that they may the more freely pillage in future, and that they may be acquitted of the wrongs which they have formerly done. But <em>Zaccheus </em>devotes <em>the half of his goods </em>to God in such a manner, as to give, at the same time, compensation for whatever wrongs he has done; and hence we infer that the riches which he possessed were not the fruit of dishonest gain. Thus <em>Zaccheus </em>is not only ready to give satisfaction, if he <em>has taken any thing by fraud</em>, but shares his lawful possessions with the poor; by which he shows that he is changed from a wolf not only into a sheep, but even into a shepherd. And while he corrects the faults which had been formerly committed, he renounces wicked practices for the future, as God demands from his people, first of all, that they abstain from doing any act of injury. <em>Zaccheus </em>has not laid others under obligation, by his example, to strip themselves of <em>the half of their goods; </em>but we have only to observe the rule which the Lord prescribes, that we dedicate ourselves, and all that we have, to holy and lawful purposes. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(680)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’ils n’ont pas la patience d’attendre que Dieu monstre ce qu’il vent faire</span>;” — “that they have not patience to wait till God show what he intends to do.” </p></div></div>
