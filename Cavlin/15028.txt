<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Their eye goeth out for fatness. </em><span class="cite-ref">(167)</span> He now adds, that it is not wonderful to see the ungodly breaking forth with such violence and cruelty, since, by reason of fatness and pampering, their eyes are ready to start out of their heads. Some explain the words <em>goeth out </em>as meaning, that their eyes being covered and hidden with fat, were, so to speak, lost, and could not be perceived in their sockets. But as fat causes the eyes to project from the head, I prefer retaining the proper meaning of the words. Let it, however, be observed, that David is not to be understood as speaking of the bodily countenance, but as expressing metaphorically the pride with which the ungodly are inflated on account of the abundance which they possess. They so glut and intoxicate themselves with their prosperity, that afterwards they are ready to burst with pride. The last clause of the verse is also explained in two ways. Some think that by the verb <span class="lang he-il">עבר</span>, <em>abar, </em>which we have translated <em>passed beyond, </em>is denoted <em>unbridled presumption; </em><span class="cite-ref">(168)</span> for the ungodly are not contented to keep themselves within ordinary bounds, but in their wild and extravagant projects mount above the clouds. We know, in fact, that they often deliberate with themselves how they may take possession of the whole world; yea, they would wish God to create new worlds for them. In short, being altogether insatiable, they pass beyond heaven and earth in their wild and unbounded desires. It would certainly not be inappropriate to explain the verb as meaning, that their foolish thoughts can be regulated by no law, nor kept within any bounds. But there is another exposition which is also very suitable, namely, that the prosperity and success which they meet with exceed all the flattering prospects which they had pictured in their imaginations. We certainly see some of them who obtain more than ever they had desired, as if, whilst they were asleep, Fortune laid nets and fished for them, <span class="cite-ref">(169)</span> — the device under which king Demetrius was in old time wittily painted, who had taken so many cities, although otherwise he was neither skillful nor vigilant, nor of great foresight. If we are inclined to take this view of the words, this clause will be added by way of exposition, to teach us what is meant by that <em>fatness, </em>spoken of before — that it means that God heaps upon the wicked, and fills them with, an abundance of all good things, beyond what they had ever either desired or thought of. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(167)</span> “Their eyes are starting out for fatness.” — <em>Horsley</em>. “<em>Their eyes swell with fatness </em>—<em>this </em>is a proverbial expression, used to designate the opulent, who are very commonly given to sensuality: comp. <span class="bvs">Job_15:27</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_17:10</span>.” — <em>Cresswell</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(168)</span> “<em>The fantasies of their minds run into excess</em>; <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , they suffer their imaginations to sway them.” —<em>Cresswell</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(169)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et pesche pour eux</span>.”<em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
