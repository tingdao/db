<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And the Lord God called unto Adam</em>. They had been already smitten by the voice of God, but they lay confounded under the trees, until another voice more effectually penetrated their minds. Moses says that Adam was called by the Lord. Had he not been called before? The former, however, was a confused sound, which had no sufficient force to press upon the conscience. Therefore God now approaches nearer, and from the tangled thicket of trees <span class="cite-ref">(185)</span> draws him, however unwilling and resisting, forth into the midst. In the same manner we also are alarmed at the voice of God, as soon as his law sounds in our ears; but presently we snatch at shadows, until he, calling upon us more vehemently, compels us to come forward, arraigned at his tribunal. Paul calls this the life of the Law, <span class="cite-ref">(186)</span> when it slays us by charging us with our sins. For as long as we are pleased with ourselves, and are inflated with a false notion that we are alive, the law is dead to us, because we blunt its point by our hardness; but when it pierces us more sharply, we are driven into new terrors. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(185)</span> “Ex multiplici arborum complexu.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(186)</span> “Vitam Legis.” The life or power of the law. — See <span class="bvs">Rom_7:6</span>. </p></div></div>
