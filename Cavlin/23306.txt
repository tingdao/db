<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>If the light which is in thee be darkness </em>Light signifies that small portion of reason, which continues to exist in men since the fall of Adam: and <em>darkness </em>signifies gross and brutal affections. The meaning is, we ought not to wonder, if men wallow so disgracefully, like beasts, in the filth of vices, for they have no reason which might restrain the blind and dark lusts of the flesh. <em>The light </em>is said to be turned into <em>darkness, </em>not only when men permit the wicked lusts of the flesh to overwhelm the judgment of their reason, but also when they give up their minds to wicked thoughts, and thus degenerate into beasts. For we see how wickedly men change into craft any measure of wisdom which had been given them, how they “dig deep (as the prophet says) to hide their counsel from the Lords” (<span class="bvs">Isa_29:15</span>,) how they trust to their own resources, and openly dishonor God; in a word, how desirous they are to show their ingenuity, in innumerable ways, for their own destruction. Christ has good grounds for declaring, that thick and appalling darkness must of necessity reign in the life of men, when they choose to be blind. </p><p>This is also the meaning of the words which are found in the Gospel of Luke, with this difference, that Christ there connects the present statement with one which was formerly explained, that <em>men do not light a candle, and put it under a bushel</em>, (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:15</span>) and again, instead of this clause, <em>if the light which is in thee be darkness, </em>gives the exhortation, <em>see that the light which is in thee be not darkness </em>The meaning is, “See that thy mind, which ought to have shone, like a candle, to guide all thy actions, do not darken and mislead thy whole life.” He afterwards adds, that, when <em>the body is enlightened by the eye, </em>the greatest regularity is found in all its members, as <em>the light of a candle </em>spreads and penetrates into every part of the room. </p></div>
