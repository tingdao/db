It is easy to learn from this the great efficacy of the voice of Christ, which reaches even to the dead, and exerts a quickening influence on death itself. Accordingly, Luke says that <em>her spirit returned, </em>or, in other words, that immediately on being called, it obeyed the command of Christ. </p></div>
