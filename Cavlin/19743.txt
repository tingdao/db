<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet adds, that he <em>wrote a book, </em>that is, the writing of the purchase; for <span class="lang he-il">ספר</span><em>sepher, </em>means in Hebrew, not only a volume, but what we call a document, and the Latins tablets, <em>(tabulas) </em>Then he says that the writing of the purchase was made, and then it was <em>sealed, </em>not as we do by appending a seal to it, but it was closed up, as the custom then was. He also adds, according to <em>the law and custom; </em>and at last he says that another writing was made which remained <em>open; </em>and it is thought that the open writing means what we call <em>a copy; </em>and so the sealed writing was deposited in a chest, and the open copy could be referred to at any time. <span class="cite-ref">(62)</span> Though the Prophet alludes to a common custom, yet I doubt not but that he wrote this prophecy on rolls, one sealed and the other open, in order that those who were then living might receive some benefit from his doctrine, and also that the authentic copy, or the original itself, might remain for posterity, as we shall hereafter see. And doubtless God not only intended to strengthen the hope of the faithful after the completed time of exile, as this prophecy would he dormant for seventy years; but he designed also that it should be then of use, so as to be a support to them in their sufferings. There was also another benefit to be derived from this prophecy, even that the Jews while in exile might begin to entertain hope, and remembering this vision, might feel assured that God would be their Deliverer, according to what he had promised. </p><p>This then was the reason why two writings of the purchase were made, the sealed and the open. <span class="cite-ref">(63)</span> The open had a present benefit, as it would make the faithful to go more willingly into exile, and calmly to submit to the chastisement allotted to them by God; and for this reason the Prophecy was to be open to all. It was also sealed, in order that after the lapse of seventy years it might animate the godly, and inspire them with the hope of their promised deliverance. This, therefore, is the reason, as I think, why the Prophet relates that he made a writing and sealed it, and then that he made another writing which remained open. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(62)</span> There were no doubt two rolls or writings, as it appears clear from <span class="bvs">Jer_32:14</span>, where the two are distinctly mentioned, “Take these rolls, this roll of the purchase, even the sealed, and this open roll,” etc. The word <span class="lang he-il">ספר</span> ought to be rendered throughout either a roll, or a book, or writing, when preceded by an article, and not “evidence,” as in our version. </p><p>There seems to be an incongruity in verse the 10<span class="cite-ref">th</span> (<span class="bvs">Jer_32:10</span>), as rendered by most; the roll is represented as “sealed,” before the “witnesses” are mentioned, and before the money was weighed. The rendering, I conceive, ought to be as follows, “So I wrote in a roll; and I sealed it, when I had made witnesses to witness <em>it, </em>and weighed the money in balances.” The <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> may often be rendered “when,” and also “so,” as it is done in the next verse in our version, though there “and” would be more suitable. The “witnesses” are expressly said in ver. 12 (<span class="bvs">Jer_32:12</span>) to have subscribed, or written in, the book or roll of purchase, which was sealed. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(63)</span> The 11th verse (<span class="bvs">Jer_32:11</span>), where the two rolls are first mentioned, is difficult to be rendered. I offer the following literal version of the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, — </p><p><span class="cite-note">11.</span>And I took the writing of the purchase, — it the sealed, the commandment and the conditions, — and it the open; and I gave the writing of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, </p><p><span class="cite-note">12.</span>The son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel my uncle’s son, and in the sight of the witnesses who wrote in the roll of the purchase, and in sight of all the Jews who </p><p><span class="cite-note">13.</span>sat in the court of the prison; and I commanded Baruch in their sight, </p><p><span class="cite-note">14.</span>saying, “Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Take these rolls, — this roll of the purchase, even it the sealed, and this open roll; and put them in au earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.’” </p><p>The two rolls are called “the writing of the purchase” in ver. 11, but distinguished, one being “sealed,” and the other “open,” or unsealed. The sealed contained “the commandment,” that is, to purchase, and “the conditions,” literally “ordinances;” which <em>Blayney </em>renders, “the assignment and the limitations,” and the <em>Vulg., </em>“the stipulations and ratifications.” But <span class="lang he-il">מצוה</span> never means anything but a precept or a commandment, and <span class="lang he-il">חקים</span> are things defined, settled, or appointed, and may be rendered “stipulations.” Thus the contents of the sealed roll are specified, but those of the open roll are not expressly mentioned. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
