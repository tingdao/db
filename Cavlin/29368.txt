<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>As it is reasonable</em>. For we are envious <span class="cite-ref">(42)</span> valuators of the gifts of God if we do not reckon as children of God those in whom there shine forth those true tokens of piety, which are the marks by which the Spirit of adoption manifests himself. Paul accordingly says, that equity itself dictates to him, <span class="cite-ref">(43)</span> that he should hope well of the Philippians in all time to come, inasmuch as he sees them to be associated with himself in participation of grace. It is not without due consideration that I have given a different rendering of this passage from that of Erasmus, as the judicious reader will easily perceive. For he states what opinion he has of the Philippians, which was the ground of his hoping well respecting them. He says, then, that they are <em>partakers with him of the same grace </em>in his <em>bonds</em>, and in the <em>defense of the gospel. </em></p><p>To <em>have them in his heart </em>is to reckon them as such in the inmost affection of his heart. For the Philippians had always assisted Paul according to their ability, so as to connect themselves with him as associates for maintaining the cause of the gospel, so far as was in their power. Thus, although they were absent in body, yet, on account of the pious disposition which they shewed by every service in their power, he recognises them as in bonds along with him. “<em>I have you</em>, therefore, <em>in my heart; </em>” this is, sincerely and without any pretense, assuredly, and with no slight or doubtful opinion — as what? as <em>partakers of grace </em>— in what? <em>in my bonds</em>, by which the gospel is defended. As he acknowledged them to be such, it was reasonable that he should hope well respecting them. </p><p><em>Of my grace and in the bonds. </em>It were a ludicrous thing in the view of the world to reckon a prison to be a benefit from God, but if we estimate the matter aright, it is no common honor that God confers upon us, when we suffer persecution for the sake of his truth. For it was not in vain that it was said, </p><p>Blessed shall ye be, when men shall afflict and harass you with all kinds of reproaches for my name’s sake. (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:11</span>) </p><p>Let us therefore bear in remembrance also, that we must with readiness and alacrity embrace the fellowship of the cross of Christ as a special favor from God. In addition to <em>bonds </em>he subjoins the <em>defense and confirmation of the gospel, </em>that he may express so much the better the honourableness of the service which God has enjoined upon us in placing us in opposition to his enemies, so as to bear testimony to his gospel. For it is as though he had entrusted us with the defense of his gospel. And truly it was when armed with this consideration, that the martyrs were prepared to contemn all the rage of the wicked, and to rise superior to every kind of torture. And would that this were present to the mind of all that are called to make a confession of their faith, that they have been chosen by Christ to be as advocates to plead his cause! For were they sustained by such consolation they would be more courageous than to be so easily turned aside into a perfidious revolt. <span class="cite-ref">(44)</span></p><p>Here, however, some one will inquire, whether the <em>confirmation of the gospel </em>depends on the steadfastness of men. I answer, that the truth of God is in itself too firm to require that it should have support from any other quarter; for though we should all of us be found liars, God, nevertheless, remains true. (<span class="bvs">Rom_3:4</span>.) There is, however, no absurdity in saying, that weak consciences are confirmed in it by such helps. That kind of confirmation, therefore, of which Paul makes mention, has a relation to men, as we learn from our own experience that the slaughter of so many martyrs has been attended at least with this advantage, that they have been as it were so many seals, by which the gospel has been sealed in our hearts. Hence that saying of Tertullian, that “the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church,” — which I have imitated in a certain poem: “But that sacred blood, <span class="cite-ref">(45)</span> the maintainer of God’s honor, will be like seed for producing offspring.” <span class="cite-ref">(46)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(42)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Maigres et desdaigneux</span>;” — “Miserable and disdainful.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(43)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Raison mesme et equite luy disent</span>;” — “Even reason and equity tell him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(44)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils seroyent si constans et fermes, qu’ils ne pourroyent estre aiseement induits a se reuolter laschement et desloyaument</span>;” — “They would be so steadfast and firm, that they could not be easily induced to revolt in a cowardly and disloyal manner.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(45)</span>Sanctus at ille cruor, divini assertor honoris,<LineBreak />Gignendam ad sobolem seminis instar erit</p><p><span class="cite-note">(46)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A l’imitation duquel au chant de victoire composé par moy en Latin en l’honneur de Jesus Christ, 1541, et lequel depuis a este reduit en rime Francois, i’ay dit</span> : — </p><p>‘<span class="lang fr-fr">Or le sang precieux par martyre espandu </span><span class="lang fr-fr"><LineBreak /></span><span class="lang fr-fr">Pour auoir a son Dieu tesmoignage rendu, </span><span class="lang fr-fr"><LineBreak /></span><span class="lang fr-fr">A l’Eglise de Dieu seruira de semence </span><span class="lang fr-fr"><LineBreak /></span><span class="lang fr-fr">Dont enfans sorteront remplis d’intelligence</span>.’“ </p><p>“In imitation of which, in the song of victory composed by me in Latin in honor of Jesus Christ, in 1541, and which has since that time been rendered into French rhyme, I have said: — </p><p>‘But the precious blood shed by martyrs <LineBreak />That it might be as a testimony rendered to its God, <LineBreak />Will in the Church of God serve as seed <LineBreak />From which children shall come forth, filled with understanding.’“ </p></div></div>
