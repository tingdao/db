<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Thou who gloriest in the law, etc. </em>Though every transgressor dishonors God, (for we are all born for this end â€” to serve him in righteousness and holiness;) yet he justly imputes in this respect a special fault to the Jews; for as they avowed God as their Lawgiver, and yet had no care to form their life according to his rule, they clearly proved that the majesty of their God was not so regarded by them, but that they easily despised him. In the same manner do they at this day dishonor Christ, by transgressing the gospel, who prattle idly about its doctrine, while yet they tread it under foot by their unbridled and licentious mode of living. </p></div>
