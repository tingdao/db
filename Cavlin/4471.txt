<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim. </em>It is unquestionable that the word Chittim is sometimes used for the Greeks. Some, indeed, imagine that the Macedonians alone are strictly called by this name; it is, however, plain that it is applied generally to the whole of Greece. But since the countries beyond the sea were not so well known to the Jews as to allow of their distinguishing them, Scripture sometimes transfers this same name to Italy. Without doubt in Daniel, (<span class="bvs">Dan_11:30</span>,) “the ships of Chittim” must be taken for those of Italy or Rome; <span class="cite-ref">(181)</span> because the angel there predicts that the ships of Chittim would come, which should overcome, and render frustrate the efforts of Antiochus; which was plainly brought to pass by the mission of Popilius. With regard to the present passage, first of all the Greeks under Alexander afflicted both Judea and Assyria; and then another affliction followed at the hands of the Romans. Since, however, Balaam has begun to prophesy of the kingdom of Christ, it is probable that the Romans are included together with the Greeks. But from hence we more clearly perceive, what I have lately adverted to, that the children of God are not so exempted from common evils as not to be often involved in them promiscuously with unelievers, as if their conditions were precisely identical. Although the Hebrews are placed on a par with the Assyrians as their companions in misfortune, still a consolation is added, <em>i.e., </em>that the Assyrians also shall perish like Chittim, when they have persecuted the Church. </p><p>What Moses adds in conclusion, viz., that Balaam returned to his people, and Balak also went to his place, tends to the commendation of God’s grace, since He dissipates the evil counsels of the wicked like clouds, and overthrows their machinations; even as Moses commemorates elsewhere this peculiar blessing of God. <span class="cite-ref">(182)</span> Micah, too, celebrates this amongst other Divine mercies: </p><p>“O my people, (he says,) remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,” etc. (<span class="bvs">Mic_6:5</span>.) </p><p>The sum is, that the enemies of the chosen people departed in dishonor without accomplishing their purpose, since God put them to confusion. </p><p><strong>(181)</strong> See <em>C. </em>on Daniel, <em>(C. Soc. Edit.,) </em>vol. 2, pp. 316, 317, 318. “Writers on the geography of the Bible entertain remarkably different ideas as to the country or countries intended by this denomination. The most probable opinion seems to us to be that which considers that the Hebrews used it to express, in a general sense, all the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean Sea, so far as known to them.” — Illustr. Corn. <em>in loco. </em></p><p><strong>(182)</strong> This deliverance is commemorated by Moses again in <span class="bvs">Deu_23:4</span>, 5, 6; but the <em>Fr</em>. reads Joshua for Moses, and refers to <span class="bvs">Jos_24:9</span></p></div>
