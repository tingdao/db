<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Fourteen years after. </em>This cannot with certainty be affirmed to be the same journey mentioned by Luke. (<span class="bvs">Act_15:2</span>.) The connection of the history leads us rather to an opposite conclusion. We find that Paul performed four journeys to Jerusalem. Of the first we have already spoken. The second took place when, in company with Barnabas, he brought the charitable contributions of the Greek and Asiatic Churches. (<span class="bvs">Act_15:25</span>.) My belief that this second journey is referred to in the present passage rests on various grounds. On any other supposition, the statements of Paul and Luke cannot be reconciled. Besides, there is ground for conjecturing that the rebuke was administered to Peter at Antioch while Paul was residing there. Now, this happened before he was sent to Jerusalem by the Churches to settle the dispute which had arisen about ceremonial observances. (<span class="bvs">Act_15:2</span>.) It is not reasonable to suppose that Peter would have used such dissimulation, if that controversy had been settled and the decree of the Apostles published. But Paul writes that he came to Jerusalem, and afterwards adds that he had rebuked Peter for an act of dissimulation, an act which Peter certainly would not have committed except in matters that were doubtful. <span class="cite-ref">(38)</span></p><p>Besides, he would scarcely have alluded, at any time, to that journey <span class="cite-ref">(39)</span> undertaken with the consent of all the believers, without mentioning the occasion of it, and the memorable decision which was passed. It is not even certain at what time the Epistle was written, only that the Greeks conjecture that it was sent from Rome, and the Latins from Ephesus. For my own part, I think that it was written, not only before Paul had seen Rome, but before that consultation had been held, and the decision of the Apostles given about ceremonial observances. While his opponents were falsely pleading the name of the apostles, and earnestly striving to ruin the reputation of Paul, what carelessness would it have angered in him to pass by the decree universally circulated among them, which struck at those very persons! <span class="cite-ref">(40)</span> Undoubtedly, this one word would have shut their mouth: “You bring against me the authority of the apostles, but who does not know their decision? and therefore I hold you convicted of unblushing falsehood. In their name, you oblige the Gentiles to keep the law, but I appeal to their own writing, which sets the consciences of men at liberty.” </p><p>We may likewise observe, that, in the commencement of the Epistle, he reproved the Galatians for having so soon revolted from the gospel which had been delivered to them. But we may readily conclude, that, after they had been brought to believe the gospel, some time must have elapsed before that dispute about the ceremonial law arose. I consider, therefore, that the fourteen years are to be reckoned, not from one journey to another, but from Paul’s conversion. The space of time between the two journeys was eleven years. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(38)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sinon les choses estant douteuses et non resolues encore</span>.” “Except in matters that were doubtful and not yet settled.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(39)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce voyage-la qui est escrit au quinzieme chapitre</span> “ “That journey which is recorded in the fifteenth chapter” (of the Acts of the Apostles.) </p><p><span class="cite-note">(40)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De la quelle il eust au assez pour les vaincre du tout</span>.” “Which would have been sufficient for gaining a complete victory over them.” </p></div></div>
