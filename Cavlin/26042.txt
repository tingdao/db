<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_24:50</span><strong>.</strong><em>And lifted up his hands, and blessed them; </em>by which he showed that the office of <em>blessing, </em>which was enjoined on the priests under the law, belonged truly and properly to himself. When men <em>bless </em>one another it is nothing else than praying in behalf of their brethren; but with God it is otherwise, for he does not merely befriend us by wishes, but by a simple act of his will grants what is desirable for us. But while He is the only Author of all blessing, yet that men might obtain a familiar view of his grace, he chose that at first the priests should <em>bless </em>in his name as mediators. Thus Melchizedek <em>blessed </em>Abraham, (<span class="bvs">Gen_14:19</span>,) and in <span class="bvs">Num_6:23</span>, a perpetual law is laid down in reference to this matter. To this purport also is what we read in <span class="bvs">Psa_118:26</span>, We <em>bless you out of the house of the Lord </em>In short, the apostle has told us that <em>to bless </em>others is a Mark of superiority; for <em>the less, </em>he says, <em>is blessed by the greater, </em>(<span class="bvs">Heb_7:7</span>.) Now when Christ, the true <em>Melchizedek </em>and eternal Priest, was manifested, it was necessary that in him should be fulfilled what had been shadowed out by the figures of the law; as Paul also shows that we are <em>blessed </em>in him by God the Father, that we may be rich in all heavenly blessings, (<span class="bvs">Eph_1:3</span>.) Openly and solemnly he once <em>blessed </em>the apostles, that believers may go direct to himself, if they desire to be partakers of his grace. In <em>the lifting up of the hands </em>is described an ancient ceremony which, we know:, was formerly used by the priests. </p></div>
