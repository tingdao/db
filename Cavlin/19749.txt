<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Ah, Lord Jehovah! </em>he says; <em>behold, thou hast made heaven and earth. </em>Were any one not to attend to the circumstances of the passage, he might think that the Prophet is here rambling, and does not connect his sentences, so that his prayer seems incoherent. But as I have already said, that as the Prophet knew that men take too much liberty when they speak of God’s works, he bridled himself in due time, before he came to his subject. He then made this sort of introduction, “O Lord, it does not behove me to contend with thee, nor is it right in me to require thee to give me a reason for thy doings, for thou hast <em>made heaven and earth by thy great power and extended arm.” </em>There is here then an implied contrast between God and mortal man; “For who am I to dare to summon thee to a contest! for thy power is justly to be dreaded by us; when we raise up our eyes to heaven, when we look on the earth, there is nothing which ought not to fill us with admiration of thy power, for its immensity appears above and below.” We hence see that the Prophet extols in high terms the power of God, in order that he might keep himself in a meek and humble state of mind, and not dare to clamor against God, nor presumptuously rush forward to pronounce a judgment on his works. <em>Behold, </em>he says; he sets before his eyes the wonderful workmanship of the world, in which the immeasurable power of God shines forth most conspicuously. </p><p>He then adds, <em>Nor is there any thing hid from thee </em>This clause admits of two meanings; for <span class="lang he-il">פלא</span>, <em>pala, </em>means wonderful, and also hidden. Now the greater part of interpreters give this explanation, — that nothing is hid from God, because all things are before his eyes, for his knowledge penetrates to the deepest depths. It may then be a commendation of God’s knowledge, as an eulogy on his power has previously been given; and this meaning is not unsuitable. </p><p>I do not, however, reject the other meaning, given by <em>Jerome, </em>that there is nothing difficult to God, or wonderful, because all things are subject to his will. Thus the Prophet might say, continuing the same thought, that the power of God, which shines forth to our view in the heavens and in the earth, may at the same time be observed in the permanent government of the world; for he who has created the heavens and the earth can do all things, so that nothing is wonderful to him, that is, nothing is difficult for his power as soon as he has decreed this or that. The main object of the Prophet is, however, still the same. <span class="cite-ref">(64)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(64)</span> The <em>Targ. </em>and the versions, except the <em>Vulg., </em>give the first sense; but the latter is no doubt the true meaning, as the word never means properly to be hidden. The phrase here literally is, “Not harder (or more marvellous) than thou shall anything be,” that is, not harder than what thou canst do. Exactly the same phrase occurs in <span class="bvs">Gen_18:14</span>. The word, in a similar clause, in <span class="bvs">Deu_30:11</span>, is rendered “hidden;” but the clause literally is, “It is not harder than thou,” that is, than what thou canst attain, or do, as the context proves, see <span class="bvs">Jer_32:14</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
