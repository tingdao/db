<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And the Lord said unto Moses. </em><span class="cite-ref">(131)</span> He now relates that it was not with self-conceived confidence that he was lately so elated, as we have seen him; <span class="cite-ref">(132)</span> but because he had been forewarned by divine revelation that the end of the contests was now near, and that nothing now remained but. that Pharaoh should fall by his mortal wound. This verse, then, is connected with the preceding, and explains its cause; because Moses would not have been at liberty to interrupt the course of his vocation, unless he had now plainly known that he was arriving at its conclusion. Nor would it otherwise agree with what follows, via, that Moses spoke to Pharaoh after he had declared that he would not appear any more in his sight, unless the subject were continued without interruption. But this sentence is introduced parenthetically, (meaning) that however obstinate Pharaoh might be, the hour was now come in which he must succumb to God. But God not only declares that the heart of Pharaoh should be changed, so that he would not hinder the people’s departure, but that he would be himself anxious for that, which he had so pertinaciously refused; for this is the meaning of the words, he will not only send you away, but altogether thrust you out. For in his alarm at their presence, he eagerly drove them from his kingdom. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(131)</span> See <em>Lat</em>. <em>, </em>Dixerat autem. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(132)</span> “Tellement que sa confiance le fait parler haut;” as to be led by his confidence to use such high language. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
