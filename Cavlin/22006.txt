<div class="comment-content"><p>His next prayer is, <em>Do thou who art our God hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine forth </em>In these words Daniel wrestles with distrust, not for his own sake privately, but for that of the whole Church to whom he set forth the true method of prayer. And experience teaches all the pious how necessary this remedy is in those doubts which break into all our prayers, and make our earnestness and ardor in prayer grow dull and cold within us, or at least we pray without any composed or tranquil confidence, and this trembling vitiates whatever we had formerly conceived. As, therefore, this daily happens to all the pious when they leave off the duty of prayer for even a short period, and some doubt draws them off and shuts the door of familiar access to God, this is the reason why Daniel so often repeats the sentence<em>, Do thou, O Lord, hear the prayer of thy. servant </em>David also inculcates such sentiments in his prayers, and has the greatest necessity for acting so. And those who are truly exercised in praying feel how Godâ€™s servants have good cause for such language whenever they pray to him. But I will complete the rest to-morrow. </p></div>
