<div class="comment-content"><p>He now, leaving out of view the testimony of other Churches, reminds the Thessalonians of what they had themselves experienced, <span class="cite-ref">(520)</span> and explains at large in what way he, and in like manner the two others, his associates, had conducted themselves among them, inasmuch as this was of the greatest importance for confirming their faith. For it is with this view that he declares his integrity — that the Thessalonians may perceive that they had been called to the faith, not so much by a mortal man, as by God himself. He says, therefore, that his <em>entering in unto them had not been vain</em>, as ambitious persons manifest much show, while they have nothing of solidity; for he employs the word <em>vain </em>here as contrasted with <em>efficacious </em></p><p>He proves this by <em>two </em>arguments. The <em>first </em>is, that he had suffered persecution and ignominy at Philippi; the <em>second </em>is, that there was a great conflict prepared at Thessalonica. We know that the minds of men are weakened, nay, are altogether broken down by means of ignominy and persecutions. It was therefore an evidence of a Divine work that Paul, after having been subjected to evils of various kinds and to ignominy, did, as if in a perfectly sound state, shew no hesitation in making an attempt upon a large and opulent city, with the view of subjecting the inhabitants of it to Christ. In this <em>entering in</em>, nothing is seen that savors of vain ostentation. In the <em>second </em>department the same Divine power is beheld, for he does not discharge his duty with applause and favor, but required to maintain a keen conflict. In the mean time he stood firm and undaunted, from which it appears that he was held up <span class="cite-ref">(521)</span> by the hand of God; for this is what he means when he says that he was <em>emboldened</em>. And, unquestionably, if all these circumstances are carefully considered, it cannot be denied that God there magnificently displayed his power. As to the history, it is to be found in the sixteenth and seventeenth chapters of the Acts.
