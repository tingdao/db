<div class="comment-content"><p>Some render the last words simply thus, “And it happened that Jerusalem was taken;” and others, “It happened accordingly that Jerusalem was taken;<em>” </em>but this seems unnatural. Others take the relative as a demonstrative pronoun, and of this I approve, “For it happened that according to this Jerusalem was taken.” </p><p>He first says that he <em>dwelt in the court of the prison. </em>It hence appears that he was not even then at liberty; for though the king wished him to be free, yet he dared not to release him. This is one thing. Then he says, that he <em>was there until the day the city was taken </em>We shall hereafter see that he was saved by the king’s command, and was brought out of prison. He was, then, until that day in the court of the prison, as though he had said, that he was a prisoner until the king was taken prisoner, together with his counselors, and also until the day the whole city was taken. And here we may see, as in a vivid form, the wonderful judgment of God. As long as the Jews boasted that they offered sacrifices to God, they kept Jeremiah shut up in prison, so that he was not a free man until the king was taken, the city perished, and almost all were driven into exile. I have no doubt but that he added the following by way of explanation, <em>And it happened that according to this Jerusalem was taken; </em>that is, he reminds readers in these words, that he had not been a false Prophet, but a true and faithful witness as to God’s judgment, for all his prophecies were verified by the event. <span class="cite-ref">(116)</span> He then says that the city was taken, not by chance, but because God had so declared.

The <em>Vulgate, </em>and the <em>Targum. </em>give this version, “And it came to pass that Jerusalem was taken;” which seems not in this connection to have any meaning. Some connect them with the following chapter, but improperly. Our version, followed by <em>Blayney, </em>gives the best sense, <em>“And </em>he was <em>there </em>(that is, in the court of the prison) when Jerusalem was taken:“ He was there not only <em>to </em>the day or time of its capture, but during that time. This was added to shew that he was not released by the Jews, but by those who took the city. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
