<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Having this ministry. </em>He now returns to a commendation of himself personally, from which he had digressed into a general discussion, in reference to the dignity of the gospel. As, therefore, he has been treating of the nature of the gospel, so he now shows how faithful and upright a minister of it he is. He has previously shown, what is the true gospel of Christ. He now shows what he preaches to be such. <em>“Having,” </em>says he, “<em>this ministry” </em>— that <em>ministry, </em>the excellence of which he had extolled in terms so magnificent, and the power and usefulness of which he had so abundantly shown forth. Hence, in order that he may not seem to extol himself too much, he premises that it was not by his own efforts, or by his own merits, that he had reached such a pinnacle of honor, but had been led forward by the mercy of God exclusively. Now there was more implied in making the <em>mercy </em>of God the reason of his Apostleship, than if he had attributed it to the <em>grace </em>of God. <em>We faint not </em><span class="cite-ref">(423)</span> that is, we are not deficient in our duty, <span class="cite-ref">(424)</span> so as not to discharge it with fidelity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(423)</span> Instead of <span class="lang el-gr">οὐκ ἐκκακοῦμεν</span>, we faint not, <span class="lang el-gr">ἐγκακοῦμεν</span>, we act not wickedly, is the reading of ADFG, and some others. Wakefield thinks it the genuine reading; it certainly makes a very good sense with what goes before and what follows. If we follow this reading, the whole verse may be read thus — ‘Wherefore, as we have obtained mercy, or been graciously entrusted, <span class="lang el-gr">ἠλεήθημεν</span>, with this ministry, we do not act wickedly, but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty.” — <em>Dr. A. Clarke</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(424)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nous n’omettons rien de ce qui est de nostre office</span>;” — “We do not omit any thing of what belongs to our office.” </p></div></div>
