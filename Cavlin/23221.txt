<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Then the devil leaveth him. </em>Luke expresses more: <em>when all the temptation had been finished. </em>This means, that no truce or relaxation was granted to Christ, till he had been fully tried by every species of contest. He adds, that Christ was <em>left for a season only. </em>This is intended to inform us, that the rest of his life was not entirely free from <em>temptations, </em>but that God restrained the power of Satan, so that Christ was not unseasonably disturbed by him. In like manner, God usually acts towards all his people: for, after permitting them to be sharply tried, he abates, in some measure, the violence of the strife, that they may take breath for a little, and gather courage. What immediately follows, <em>the angels waited on him, </em>I understand as referring to comfort, that Christ might feel, that God the Father took care of him, and fortified him, by his powerful assistance, against Satan. For the very solitude might aggravate the dreariness of his condition, when he was deprived of the kind offices of men, <em>and was with the wild beasts, </em>â€” a circumstance which is expressly mentioned by Mark. And yet we must not suppose, that Christ was ever forsaken by the angels: but, in order to allow an opportunity for temptation, the grace of God, though it was present, was sometimes hidden from him, so far as respects the feeling of the flesh. </p></div>
