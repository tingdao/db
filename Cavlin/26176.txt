<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Sir, I perceive that thou art a Prophet. </em>The fruit of the reproof now becomes evident; for not only does the woman modestly acknowledge her fault, but, being ready and prepared to listen to the doctrine of Christ, which she had formerly disdained, she now desires and requests it of her own accord. Repentance, therefore, is the commencement of true docility, as I have already said, and opens the gate for entering into the school of Christ. Again, the woman teaches us by her example, that when we meet with any teacher, we ought to avail ourselves of this opportunity, that we may not be ungrateful to God, who never sends <em>Prophets </em>to us without, as it were, stretching out the hand to invite us to himself. But we must remember what Paul teaches, that they who have grace given to them to teach well <span class="cite-ref">(77)</span> are sent to us by God; for </p><p>how shall they preach unless they are sent? (<span class="bvs">Rom_10:15</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(77)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui ont la grace de bien enseigner</span>.” </p></div></div>
