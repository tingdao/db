<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>The Spirit of truth. </em>Christ bestows on the Spirit another title, namely, that he is the Master or Teacher of truth. <span class="cite-ref">(68)</span> Hence it follows, that until we have been inwardly instructed by him, the understandings of all of us are seized with vanity and falsehood. </p><p><em>Whom the world cannot receive. </em>This contrast shows the peculiar excellence of that grace which God bestows on none but his elect; for he means that it is no ordinary gift of which the world is deprived. In this sense, too, Isaiah says, “<em>For</em>, the darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise on thee, O Jerusalem!” <span class="cite-ref">(69)</span> For the mercy of God towards the Church deserves so much the higher praise, when he exalts the Church, by a distinguished privilege, above the whole world. And yet Christ exhorts the disciples, that they must not be puffed up, as the world is wont to be, by carnal views, and thus drive away from themselves the grace of the Spirit. All that Scripture tells us about the Holy Spirit is regarded by earthly men as a dream; because, trusting to their own reason, they despise heavenly illumination. Now, though this pride abounds everywhere, which extinguishes, so far as lies in our power, the light of the Holy Spirit; yet, conscious of our own poverty, we ought to know, that whatever belongs to sound understanding proceeds from no other source. Yet Christ’s words show that nothing which relates to the Holy Spirit can be learned by human reason, but that He is known only by the experience of faith. </p><p><em>The world</em>, he says, <em>cannot receive the Spirit</em>, <em>because it knoweth him not</em>; <em>but you know him</em>, <em>because he dwelleth with you</em>. It is the Spirit alone therefore, who, by <em>dwelling in us</em>, makes himself to be known by us, for otherwise, he is unknown and incomprehensible. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(68)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A scavoir qu’il est Maistre ou Docteur de la verite</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(69)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sur toy, O Jerusalem</span> !” </p></div></div>
