<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>This day is born to you </em>Here, as we lately hinted, the angel expresses the cause of the joy. <em>This day is born </em>the Redeemer long ago promised, who was to restore the Church of God to its proper condition. The angel does not speak of it as a thing altogether unknown. He opens his embassy by referring to the Law and the Prophets; for had he been addressing heathens or irreligious persons, it would have been of no use to employ this mode of speaking: <em>this day is born to you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord </em>For the same reason, he mentions that he was born <em>in the city of David, </em>which could serve no purpose, but to recall the remembrance of those promises which were universally known among the Jews. Lastly, the angel adapted his discourse to hearers who were not altogether unacquainted with the promised redemption. With the doctrine of the Law and the Prophets he joined the Gospel, as emanating from the same source. Now, since the Greek word Greek, as Cicero assures us, has a more extensive meaning than the Latin word <em>Servator, </em>and as there is no Latin noun that corresponds to it, I thought it better to employ a barbarous term, than to take anything away from the power of Christ. And I have no doubt, that the author of the Vulgate, and the ancient doctors of the Church, had the same intention. <span class="cite-ref">(150)</span> Christ is called Savior, <span class="cite-ref">(151)</span> because he bestows a complete salvation. The pronoun <em>to you </em><span class="cite-ref">(152)</span> is very emphatic; for it would have given no great delight to hear that the Author of salvation was <em>born, </em>unless each person believed that for himself he was born. In the same manner Isaiah says, “Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_9:6</span>;) and Zechariah, “Behold, thy King cometh unto thee lowly,” (<span class="bvs">Zec_9:9</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(150)</span> He refers to his use of the Latin word <em>Salvator </em><em>, </em>for which there is no classical authority. The apology may be deemed unnecessary; but Calvin was entitled to be more sensitive on this point than many modern scholars. The purity of his style discovers so perfect an acquaintance with the writers of the Augustan age, that it must have given him uneasiness to depart from their authorized terms. He pleads high authority for the liberty he had taken. Cicero, whose command of the resources of his native tongue will not be questioned, acknowledges that there is no Latin word which conveys the full import of the Greek word<span class="lang el-gr">σωτ́ηρ, </span> and in this, as well as many other instances, calls in the aid of a richer and more expressive language than his own. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(151)</span> “<em>Salvator </em><em>.” </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(152)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Au reste, ce n'est pas sans cause que ce mot </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Vous </em><span class="lang fr-fr">est adjouste: et il est bien a poiser. Car il ne serviroit gueres de savoir que le Sauveur est nay, sinon qu'un chacun appliquast cela a sa personne, s'asseurant que c'est pour lui qu'est nay le Fils de Dieu</span>.” — “Besides, it is not without reason that this word <em>You </em>is added; and it is well to weigh it. For it would hardly be of service to know that the Savior is born, unless each applied that to his own person, being persuaded that it is for him that the Savior is born.” </p></div></div>
