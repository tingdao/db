<div class="comment-content"><p>Here he says, first, that he was held <em>shut up; </em>for <span class="lang he-il">גדר</span>, <em>gidar, </em>is to enclose, and <span class="lang he-il">גדרה</span>, <em>gidare, </em>means a fence or a mound, or an enclosure of any kind. He then says, that he was shut up as it were by a fence, so that he could not go forth; literally, it is, and <em>I shall not go forth; </em>but the conjunction here is to be taken as denoting the end. He has <em>shut me up, </em>he says, or he has enclosed me, that I might not get out. </p><p>It then follows, <em>He hath made heavy my fetter. </em>His meaning is, that he was not only bound with fetters, but so bound that he could not raise up his feet, as though he had said, that he not only had fetters, but that they were so heavy that he could not even move his feet. </p></div>
