<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>But God will redeem my soul </em>The Hebrew particle, <span class="lang he-il">אך</span><em>, ach, </em>may be also translated, <em>surely, </em>or <em>certainly. </em>The psalmist had made a general assertion of the great truth, that the righteous shall have dominion in the morning, and now he applies it to himself for the confirmation of his own faith. This verse may, therefore, be regarded as a kind of appendix to the former; in it he makes a personal application of what had been said of all the righteous. By the word, <em>the hand, </em>is to be understood <em>the dominion </em>and <em>power, </em>and not <em>the stroke, </em>of the grave, as some have rendered it. The prophet does not deny his liability to death; but he looks to God as He who would defend and redeem him from it. We have here a convincing proof of that faith in which the saints under the Law lived and died. It is evident that their views were directed to another and a higher life, to which the present was only preparatory. Had the prophet merely intended to intimate that he expected deliverance from some ordinary emergency, this would have been no more than what is frequently done by the children of the world, whom God often delivers from great dangers. But here it is evident that he hoped for a life beyond the grave, that he extended his glance beyond this sublunary sphere, and anticipated the morning which will introduce eternity. From this we may conclude, that the promises of the Law were spiritual, and that our fathers who embraced them were willing to confess themselves pilgrims upon earth, and sought an inheritance in heaven. It evinced gross stupidity in the Sadducees, educated as they were under the Law, to conceive of the soul as mortal. The man must be blind indeed who can find no mention of a future life in this passage. To what other interpretation can we wrest the preceding verse, when it speaks of a morning altogether new and peculiar? We are sufficiently accustomed to see the return of morning, but it points us to a day of an extraordinary kind, when God himself shall rise upon us as the sun, and surprise us with the discovery of his glory. When the Psalmist adds, <em>Assuredly God will redeem my soul </em><span class="cite-ref">(230)</span><em>from the power of the grave, </em>does he not contemplate a special privilege, such as could not be shared by all other men? If deliverance from death, then, be a privilege peculiar to the children of God, it is evident that they are expectants of a better life. We must not overlook, (what I have already noticed,) that the sure method of profiting by the divine promises is, to apply to ourselves what God has offered generally to all without exception. This is done by the prophet, for how could he have arrived at an assured promise of the redemption of his soul, except by the general fact known to him of the future glory awaiting the children of God, and by concluding himself to be amongst their number? The last clause of the verse runs in the Hebrew literally, <em>for he will take me up </em>Some, however, resolve the causal particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, <em>ki, </em>which we render<em>for, </em>into the adverb of time <em>when, </em>and the verb <span class="lang he-il">לקח</span>, <em>lakach, </em>which we translate <em>to receive </em>or <em>to take up, </em>they translate <em>to cut off, </em>or <em>take away from this world, </em>giving to the passage this sense, When God shall have called my soul out of this world to himself, he will rescue it from the power of the grave. I am afraid that this is rather too strained an interpretation. Those seem to take a juster view of the words who consider that the future tense has been substituted for the perfect, and who retain the proper signification of the causal particle, reading, <em>for he has taken me up </em>The prophet did not consider that the ground of his hope for a better resurrection was to be found in himself, but in the gratuitous adoption of God who had taken him into his favor. There is no need, however, why we should suppose a change of tense, and not understand the Psalmist as meaning that God would redeem his soul from death, by undertaking the guardianship of it when he came to die. The despairing fears which so many entertain when descending to the grave spring from the fact of their not commending their spirit to the preserving care of God. They do not consider it in the light of a precious deposit which will be safe in his protecting hands. Let our faith be established in the great truth, that our soul, though it appears to evanish upon its separation from the body, is in reality only gathered to the bosom of God, there to be kept until the day of the resurrection. </p><p><strong>(230)</strong><em>Soul </em>is not here to be understood of the intellectual immaterial spirit. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">נפשי</span>, <em>naphshi</em>, <em>my soul</em>, is often put in the Old Testament Scriptures for the personal pronoun; and thus it means <em>my person</em>, <em>myself</em>, <em>me</em>. — See Appendix., Note on <span class="bvs">Psa_16:10</span>. </p></div>
