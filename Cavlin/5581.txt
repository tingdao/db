<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>I have not eaten thereof in my mourning </em>(<em>tristitia</em>) It is clear that the sacred offerings are here spoken of; but the question is, what is meant by eating in mourning? This is the exposition received by almost universal consent; that although want may have tempted them to theft and fraud, yet the people assert that, even in their poverty and straits, they have abstained from the hallowed things; and to this I willingly assent; although this word “mourning” may be taken for the anxiety of a mind conscious of its iniquity in this sense, “Ihave not knowingly and willingly eaten anything consecrated to God, so that the hot iron (<em>cauterium</em>) of an evil conscience should burn me, in the way in which man’s guilt ever torments and troubles him.” As to the second clause, interpreters differ. Some translate the word <em>‘ </em><span class="lang he-il">בער</span><em>bagnar, </em><span class="cite-ref">(221)</span><em>“ </em>to destroy:” as if it were said, that they had suffered nothing to perish through uncleanness; but others explain it, I have taken away nothing for a profane purpose. My own opinion is, however, that the word <em>‘ </em><span class="lang he-il">טמא</span>, <em>tama, </em>is used adverbially for “impurely,” so that the people testify that they are not polluted, or contaminated by withholding anything. <span class="cite-ref">(222)</span> Thus, in my idea, some do not badly translate it “by uncleanness:” for it was not possible for the Israelites to apply the tithes to other uses, without contracting pollution by their wicked abuse of them. The ambiguity in the third clause is still greater; literally it is, “I have not given thereof to the dead.” In my version I have followed those who refer it to funeral rites; but some suppose that the word “dead” is used metaphorically for an unclean thing; others, in a less natural sense, for expenses, which do not contribute to support man’s life. But it does not yet appear wherefore it should he said that nothing had been spent on funeral rites. It is true that whatever had touched a dead body was unclean; and therefore some expound it, that the victims had not been polluted by any connection with funeral preparations. But if this sense is preferred, the expression must be taken by <em>synecdoche </em>for anything unclean. My own opinion however, is, that under this particular head all things are included which have a shew of piety. The burial of the dead was a praiseworthy office and a religious exercise; <span class="cite-ref">(223)</span> so that it might afford a colorable pretext for peculiar laxity; in this word, therefore, God would have the Israelites declare, that they offered no excuse if they had misemployed any of the consecrated things. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(221)</span><span class="lang he-il">בער</span>, is to <em>consume, </em>and especially as fire consumes.
