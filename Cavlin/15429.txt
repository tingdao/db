<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>Thy throne is stable </em>Some read, <em>is prepared, </em>and this agrees well with the context. provided we take the two clauses as one sentence, meaning — <em>O Lord, as thou art from eternity, even so thy throne is erected or prepared from that time </em>For the sense which some have attached to the words, as if they contained a simple assertion of God’s eternity, is poor; and the Psalmist evidently intends to say that as God is eternal in essence, so he has always been invested with power and majesty. The term <em>throne </em>signifies, by the figure synecdoche, righteousness, and office or power of government; it being customary to transfer such images taken from men to God, in accommodation to our infirmity. <span class="cite-ref">(4)</span> By this ascription of praise the Psalmist effectually disposes of all the absurd ideas which have been broached, tending to deny or disparage the power of God, and declares, upon the matter, that God may sooner cease to be, than to sit upon his throne in the government of this world. </p><p><strong>(4)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Selon que ces similitudes-ci prinses des hommes ont de coustume d’estre appropriees a Dieu, pour le regard et la portee de nostre infirmite</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
