<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>Be merciful unto me, O God! for man swallows me up </em><span class="cite-ref">(330)</span> It would be difficult to determine whether he speaks here of foreign or domestic enemies. When brought to King Achish he was as a sheep between two bands of wolves, an object of deadly hatred to the Philistines on the one hand, and exposed to equal persecutions from his own fellow-countrymen. He uses the indefinite term <em>man </em>in this verse, though in the next he speaks of having many enemies, the more forcibly to express the truth that the whole world was combined against him, that he experienced no humanity amongst men, and stood in the last necessity of divine help. The term <em>daily </em>would suggest that he refers more immediately to Saul and his faction. But in general, he deplores the wretchedness of his fate in being beset with adversaries so numerous and so barbarous. Some translate <span class="lang he-il">שאף</span>, <em>shaaph, to regard, </em>but it is more properly rendered <em>to swallow up, </em>a strong expression, denoting the insatiable rage with which they assailed him. I have adhered to the common translation of <span class="lang he-il">לחם</span><em>, lacham, </em>though it also signifies <em>to eat up, </em>which might consist better with the metaphor already used in the preceding part of the verse. It is found, however, in the sense <em>to fight against, </em>and I was unwilling to depart from the received rendering. I shall only observe in passing, that those who read in the second member of the verse, <em>many fighting with me, </em>as if he alluded to the assistance of angels, mistake the meaning of the passage; for it is evident that he uses the language of complaint throughout the verse. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(330)</span> The verb here translated <em>swallows me up</em>, is rendered by French and Skinner, <em>panteth after me</em>. It is literally <em>draweth in the air</em>. It thus implies the intense desire of David’s enemies to get him into their hands, and to destroy him. </p></div></div>
