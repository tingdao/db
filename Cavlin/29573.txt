<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>For our exhortation</em>. He confirms, by another argument, the Thessalonians in the faith which they had embraced â€” inasmuch as they had been faithfully and purely instructed in the word of the Lord, for he maintains that his doctrine was free from all deception and uncleanness. And with the view of placing this matter beyond all doubt, he calls their conscience to witness. The three terms which he makes use of may, it would seem, be distinguished in this manner: <em>imposture </em>may refer to the substance of doctrine, <em>uncleanness </em>to the affections of the heart, <em>guile </em>to the manner of acting. In the <em>first </em>place, therefore, he says that they had not been deluded or imposed upon by fallacies, when they embraced the kind of doctrine that had been delivered to them by him. <em>Secondly</em>, he declares his integrity, inasmuch as he had not come to them under the influence of any impure desire, but actuated solely by upright disposition. <em>Thirdly</em>, he says that he had done nothing fraudulently or maliciously, but had, on the contrary, manifested a simplicity befitting a minister of Christ. As these things were well known to the Thessalonians, they had a sufficiently firm foundation for their faith. </p></div>
