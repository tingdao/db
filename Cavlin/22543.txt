<div class="comment-content"><p>The sailors asked counsel of Jonah; and hence it appears that they were touched with so much fear as not to dare to do any thing to him. We hence see how much they had improved almost in an instant, since they spared an Israelite, because they acknowledged that among that people the true God was worshipped, the supreme King of heaven and earth: for, without a doubt, it was this fear that restrained them from throwing Jonah immediately into the sea. For since it was certain that through his fault God was displeased with them all, why was it that they did not save themselves by such an expiation? That they then delayed in so great a danger, and dared not to lay hold instantly on Jonah, was an evident proof that they were restrained, as I have said, by the fear of God. </p><p>They therefore inquire what was to be done, <em>What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be still to us? </em><span class="cite-ref">(27)</span><em>for the sea was going, </em>etc. By going Jonah means, that the sea was turbulent: for the sea is said to rest when it is calm, but when it is turbulent, then it is going, and has various movements and tossings. <em>The sea, </em>then, <em>was going and very tempestuous </em><span class="cite-ref">(28)</span> We hence see that God was not satisfied with the disgrace of Jonah, but he purposed to punish his offense still more. It was necessary that Jonah should be led to the punishment which he deserved, though afterwards, he was miraculously delivered from death, as we shall see in its proper place. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(27)</span> Literally, “that the sea may cease from upon us.” The waves were rolling over them; hence <span class="lang he-il">מעלינו</span>, from upon us. That the sea may be calm <em>around </em>us, is to give a meaning to the word which it never has. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(28)</span><span class="lang he-il">כי הים הולך ומער</span>, “<span class="lang el-gr">ὅτι η θαλασσα επορευετο και εξηγειρε μαλλον κλυδωνα </span> — for the sea went and more raised the swell.” — <em>Sept. </em>“Quia mare ibat et intumescebat; — for the sea did go and swell.” — <em>Jerome, Grotius, </em>and the <em>Vulgate. </em>“For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.” — <em>Newcome. </em>The verb <span class="lang he-il">הולך</span>, connected as here with another verb, does not always mean increase, but continuance. See <span class="bvs">Gen_8:3</span>; <span class="bvs">Est_9:4</span>. Literally it is, “For the sea <em>was </em>going on, and was tempestuous,” that is, it continued to be tempestuous. An increase of violence seemed not to have been hardly possible, for a shipwreck was previously dreaded. <em>Jerome, </em>in a strain rather imaginary, but striking, says, “<em>For the sea went and did swell, </em>— it <em>went</em>, as it had been commanded, — it went, to manifest the vengeance of its Lord, — it went, to prosecute a runaway Prophet; and it <em>swelled </em>at every moment, and rose, as it were, in larger billows, while the mariners were delaying, to show that they could not put off the vengeance of its Creator.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
