<div class="comment-content"><p>These verses are to be read together; for the Prophet first shews that Israel was not as to his original condition miserable, but that this happened through a new cause, and then he mentions the cause. He then first asks, <em>whether Israel was a servant or a slave? </em>God had adopted them as his people, and had promised to be so bountiful to them as to render them in every way happy; and what was more, as a proof of their happiness, he said, In thee shall all nations be blessed. (<span class="bvs">Gen_12:3</span>; <span class="bvs">Gen_22:18</span>; <span class="bvs">Gen_26:4</span>; <span class="bvs">Gen_28:14</span>.) We then see what was the original condition of Israel; they excelled all other nations, because they were God’s peculiar people, they were his heritage, they were a royal priesthood. </p><p>Hence the Prophet, as though astonished at something new and strange, asks this question, <em>Is Israel a servant? </em>He was free beyond all nations; for he was the first — born son of God: it was therefore necessary to inquire for the cause why he was so miserable; for he says afterwards, that <em>lions roared against him, and sent forth their voice; </em>he says, that their <em>cities were burnt, </em>or destroyed; he says, that their land was reduced to desolation; and at length he adds, <em>Has not this done these things to thee? </em>This again is put as a question, but it is doubly affirmative, for it takes away every doubt: “What do you say is the cause why you are so miserable? for all are hostile to you, and you are exposed to the wrongs of all: whence can you say has all this proceeded, except from your own wickedness?” We now see what the Prophet means. </p><p>But that what he says may be more clear, we must remember that he reminds the people, by way of reproach, of the benefits which God had conferred on them. As then the children of Abraham had been honored with so many singular favors that they had the preeminence over all the world, this dignity is now referred to, but only for the purpose of exposing their base conduct, as though he had said, “God did not deceive you, when he promised to be bountiful to you; his adoption is not deceptive nor in vain: hence you would have been happier than all other nations, had not your own wickedness rendered you miserable.” We now see for what end the Prophet asked, <em>Is Israel a servant or a slave? </em>They were indeed on an equality with other people, as they were by nature; but as they had been chosen by God, and as he had favored them with that peculiar privilege, the Prophet asks, whether they were servants, as though he had said, “What is it that prevents that blessedness to appear among you, which God has promised? for it was not God’s design to disappoint you: it then follows that you are miserable through your own fault.” <span class="cite-ref">(41)</span></p><p>And by saying, <em>Why is he become a prey, </em>he intimates that except Israel had been deprived of God’s protection, they would not have been thus exposed to the caprice of their enemies. They were not then become a prey except for this reason, because God had forsaken them, according to what is said in the song of Moses, </p><p>“How should one chase a thousand, and ten should put to flight as many thousands, except God had given us up as captives, except we had been shut up by his hand.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Deu_32:30</span>.) </p><p>For Moses in that passage does also in an indirect manner remind the people how often and how wonderfully God had given them victories over their enemies, and thus he leaves it to their posterity, when in distress, to consider how the change came that one should chase a thousand; that is, how could it be, that they, possessing great forces, should yet be put to flight by their enemies; for they were not wont to turn their backs, but to conquer their enemies: it then follows, that they were made captives by God, and not by the men who chased them. So also here the Prophet shews, that Israel would not have been made a prey, had they not been deprived of God’s assistance. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(41)</span> The difficulty of understanding this passage has arisen from not considering the questions in a negative sense, as implying a strong denial-”Is Israel a servant (or, rather a slave)?” No, by no means. “Is he one begotten in the house,” that is, in a state of bondage? No, by no means. Then the following question comes naturally; since he is neither a purchased slave, nor a slave born in the house, “why has he become a prey?” That there were two sorts of slaves of this kind is evident from many parts of Scripture. See <span class="bvs">Gen_17:12</span>, <span class="bvs">Gen_17:23</span>, <span class="bvs">Gen_17:27</span>; <span class="bvs">Exo_21:4</span>; <span class="bvs">Lev_22:11</span>. This is the view taken evidently in our version, by <em>Jun </em>and <em>Trem</em>. <em>, Piscator, Gataker, Grotius, Henry, </em>and <em>Scott</em>. </p><p><em>Blarney </em>renders the two first lines thus, — </p><p>Is Israel a slave? or if a child of the household, Wherefore is he exposed to spoil? </p><p>He considers “the child of the household” to be the son and the heir, as Isaac was, and refers to <span class="bvs">Gal_4:7</span>. <em>Horsley </em>coincides with him. But the <em>usus loquendi </em> gives no countenance to this view, while it confirms the other. To refer to <em>filiusfamilias </em> in Latin is to no purpose. “The child of the house,” as the expression literally is, and similar phrases, ever mean in Scripture those who were born slaves in a family. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
