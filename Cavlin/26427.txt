<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>46.</strong><em>Which of you? </em>This question proceeds from perfect confidence; for, knowing that they could not justly bring any reproach against him, he glories over his enemies, as having obtained a victory. And yet he does not say that he is free from their slanders; for, though they had no reason for reproaching, still they did not cease to pour out slanders on Christ; but he means that no crime dwells in him. And such is the import of the Greek word <span class="lang el-gr">ἐλέγχειν</span>, as the Latins use <em>coarguere</em>, (<em>to convict</em>,) when a person is held <em>convicted </em>of the fact. <em>Which of you Convicteth me of sin? </em>Yet those who think that Christ here asserts his complete innocence, because he alone surpassed all men, so far as he was the Son of God, are mistaken. For this defense must be restricted to what belongs to the passage, as if he had asserted that nothing could be brought forward to show that he was not a faithful servant of God. In like manner Paul also glories that he is not conscious of any crime (<span class="bvs">1Co_4:4</span>;) for that does not extend to the whole life, but is only a defense of his doctrine and apostleship. It is away from the subject, therefore, to speculate, as some do, about the perfection of righteousness which belongs to the Son of God alone; since the only object which he has in view is, to give authority to his ministry, as appears more clearly from what follows; for he again adds immediately afterwards, <em>If I speak truth, why do you not believe me? </em>From which we infer that Christ is rather defending his doctrine than his person. </p></div>
