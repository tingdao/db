<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>For we can do nothing</em>: That is — “I do not seek, or desire any other power, than what the Lord has conferred upon me, that I may promote the truth. To false Apostles it is all one, provided they have power; and they feel no concern to make use of their power for the promotion of what is good.” In short, he defends and maintains the honor of his ministry, in so far as it is connected with the truth of God. “What does it matter to me? For unless I have in view to promote the truth, all the power that I shall claim will be false and groundless. If, however, I lay out, whatever I have, for the promotion of the truth, I, in that case, do not consult my own interest. Now, when the authority of doctrine is safe, and truth is uninjured, I have what I desire. In contending, therefore, so keenly, I am not influenced by any exclusive regard for myself personally.” By this consideration, however, he intimates, that the man, who fights and labors for the truth alone will not take it amiss, should occasion require it, to be regarded in the judgment of men as a <em>reprobate, </em>provided this does not interfere with the glory of God, the edification of the Church, and the authority of sound doctrine. </p><p>This passage must be carefully observed, because it limits the power, which the Pastors of the Church should have, and fixes its proper bounds — that they be ministers of the truth. Papists loudly tell us, that it is said, </p><p>He that heareth you, heareth me;<LineBreak />he that despiseth you, despiseth me, (<span class="bvs">Luk_10:16</span>); </p><p>and likewise: </p><p>Obey them that are set over you, (<span class="bvs">Heb_13:17</span>); </p><p>and under this pretext they take to themselves the utmost liberty, so as to usurp unbounded dominion, while they are, at the same time, the avowed and sworn enemies of the truth, and aim at its destruction by every means in their power. For exposing such impudence, this one statement of Paul will suffice — which declares, that they must themselves be in subjection to the truth. <span class="cite-ref">(962)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(962)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il faut que ceux qui ont le gouernement en l’Eglise, seruent la verite</span>;” — “That it is necessary that those, who have the government of the Church, be subject to the truth.” </p></div></div>
