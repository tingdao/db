<div class="comment-content"><p>He turns now to address the nations, which had never heard anything of true religion. But the design of the apostrophe was, to make the Jews ashamed of their insensibility and deafness, for more attention and understanding were found among heathen nations. This was surely very great shame: the Jews had been plainly taught by the Law and by the Prophets, God had continued morning and evening to repeat the same things to them, that the nations, who had never heard the prophets and to whom the Law had not been given, should still be endued with more understanding and judgment than the Jews — this was very shameful and really monstrous. Thus the Prophet’s design was to expose their disgraceful conduct by addressing the nations, and saying, <em>Hear, ye nations </em></p><p>Then he says, <em>Know, thou assembly </em>The words used are <span class="lang he-il">דעי</span><em>, doi, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">עדה</span>, <em>ode; </em>and though the letters are inverted, there is yet an alliteration by no means ungraceful. With regard to the meaning, the Prophet shews that he found no disciples among the elect people, for they were like brute beasts or stones or trunks; he therefore turned to address the nations, as he despaired of any fruit to his labors among the Jews: ye <em>nations, </em>then, <em>hear, and know, thou assembly, </em>(the reference is to any people,) <em>what shall be to them </em>Some interpreters apply this to their vices, and give this version, “What their state <em>is, “ </em>or, “What atrocious vices prevail and reign among them.” But I prefer to apply it to their punishment, though I do not contend for this view, as there is a probability in favor of the other. But the Prophet seems here to send for the nations, that they might be witnesses of the just vengeance of God, because the people’s impiety had become irreclaimable. “Hear then what shall be done to them.” He had threatened the Jews as he had done before, and as he will often do hereafter; but his design in this place was to reproach them for being so intractable; for he expected that his labors would produce more fruit among the nations than among them. <span class="cite-ref">(179)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(179)</span> The version of the <em>Septuagint </em>is wholly inconsistent with the drift of the passage. The other ancient versions are materially according to our version. Several MSS. read <span class="lang he-il">ודעו</span> for <span class="lang he-il">ודעי</span>; and this renders the meaning much better. Then <span class="lang he-il">עדה</span> is “testimony” as well as “assembly,“ which appears here very much without meaning. The two verses would then be as follows, — </p><p><span class="cite-note">18.</span>Therefore hear, ye nations, And know the testimony which is against them; </p><p><span class="cite-note">19.</span><em>Yea, </em>hear thou earth, — Behold, I am bringing an evil on this people, The fruit of their own devices, Because to my words they have not hearkened; And my law, they have ever rejected it. </p><p>The preposition <span class="lang he-il">ב</span> is found after the verb, to testify, and is even rendered <em>to </em>or <em>against; </em>and coming after the substantive, testimony, it ought to be rendered the same. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
