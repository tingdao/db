<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>And it shall come to pass, when the Lord</em>. I have lately expounded a similar passage, which, although it is subsequent in the order observed by Moses, yet, inasmuch as it sets out the matter more clearly, I have not hesitated for perspicuity’s sake to put first. I said that God’s intention was, whilst appointing the Israelites to proclaim their own condemnation, to lay them under more solemn obligation to keep the Law. If He had Himself declared His will through the Levites only, they ought indeed to have been seriously affected, and to have listened with reverence both to the blessings and the curses; but when each of them testifies with his own mouth what the Levites dictated by God’s command, the introduction of this assent, as a solemn ratification, <span class="cite-ref">(205)</span> was more efficacious in awakening their zeal and attention. A more fitting season, however, for this protest was after they had entered the promised land than as if it had been made in the plain of Moab; for the sight of the land tended to its confirmation, as if they had been brought into court to make a covenant with God. </p><p>These <span class="cite-ref">(206)</span> two mountains are situated opposite to each other, in such a manner that the two divisions of the people might easily stand to bless and to curse, so that they might in concert approve of the promises and threats of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(205)</span> The Latin word used by <em>C</em>. is a legal one, <em>ratihabitio</em>, explained by Du Cange by “<em>confirmatio</em>, occurring more than once in the Digest, and in more modern writers.” — Adelung’s Gloss. Man., <em>in voce</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(206)</span> “Ebal and Gerizim are two closely adjoining mountains, separated by a narrow valley, about a furlong in breadth, in which stands the town of Naplous, the ancient Shechem. This beautiful valley, covered with olive woods and corn fields, has Mount Gerizim on the south, and Mount Ebal on the north. The two mountains are, according to Buckingham, nearly equal in altitude, neither of them exceeding seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the valley, but much more above the level of the sea, as the whole country here is considerably elevated.” — Illustrated Comment on <span class="bvs">Deu_27:4</span>. </p></div></div>
