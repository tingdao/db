<div class="comment-content"><p>Why then <em>has pain laid hold on thee as on one in travail? Be in pain, </em>he says, <em>and groan; </em><span class="cite-ref">(132)</span> that is, I will not prevent thee to grieve and to mourn; as though he said, “Certainly even the strongest cannot look on calamities so dreadful, without suffering the heaviest sorrow; but though God may for a time subject his children to the greatest tortures, and expose them to the most grievous evils, he will yet restore them at length from their exile.” <em>Thou shalt depart</em>, he says, <em>from the city, and dwell in the field: thou shalt come even to Babylon; but there thou shalt be delivered; there shall Jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thy enemies </em>The import of the whole is, that though God would have a care for his people, as he had promised, there was yet no cause for the faithful to flatter themselves, as though they were to be exempt from troubles; but the Prophet, on the contrary, exhorts them to prepare themselves to undergo calamities, as they were not only to be ejected from their country, and to wander in strange lands like vagrants, but were to be led away into Babylon as to their grave. </p><p>But to strengthen the minds of the faithful to bear the cross, he gives them a hope of deliverance, and says, that God would <em>there deliver </em>them, and <em>there redeem </em>them from the hand of their enemies. He repeats the adverb, <span class="lang he-il">שם</span>, <em>shem</em>, there, twice, and not without cause: for the faithful might have excluded every hope of deliverance, as though the gate of God’s power had been closed. And this is the reason why the Prophet repeats twice<em>, there, there; </em>even from the grave he will deliver and redeem thee: “Extend then your hope, not only to a small measure of favor, as though God could deliver you only from a state of some small danger, but even to death itself. Though then ye lay, as it were, in your graves, yet doubt not but that God will stretch forth his hand to you, for he will be your deliverer. God then in whose power is victory, can overcome many and innumerable deaths.” </p><p><strong>(132)</strong><em>Ingemisce </em><em>, </em>groan, mourn, or sigh and sob. <span class="lang he-il">גחי</span>, burst forth, or break out; that is, into tears or mourning. “Bring forth,” as it is rendered by <em>Newcome </em>and <em>Henderson, </em>seems not to be the import of the word here.
