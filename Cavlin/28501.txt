<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified </em>He obviates an objection, which might occasion anxiety to believers. The relationship of marriage is singularly close, so that the wife is the half of the man — so that <em>they two are one flesh </em>— (<span class="bvs">1Co_6:16</span>) — so that <em>the husband is the head of the wife</em>; (<span class="bvs">Eph_5:23</span>;) and she is her husband’s partner in everything; hence it seems impossible that a believing husband should live with an ungodly wife, or the converse of this, without being polluted by so close a connection. Paul therefore declares here, that marriage is, nevertheless, sacred and pure, and that we must not be apprehensive of contagion, as if the wife would contaminate the husband. Let us, however, bear in mind, that he speaks here not of contracting marriages, but of maintaining those that have been already contracted; for where the matter under consideration is, whether one should marry an unbelieving wife, or whether one should marry an unbelieving husband, then that exhortation is in point — </p><p>Be not yoked with unbelievers, for there is no agreement between Christ and Belial. (<span class="bvs">2Co_6:14</span>.) </p><p>But he that is already bound has no longer liberty of choice; hence the advice given is different. </p><p>While this <em>sanctification </em>is taken in various senses, I refer it simply to marriage, in this sense — It might seem (judging from appearance) as if a believing wife contracted infection from an unbelieving husband, so as to make the connection unlawful; but it is otherwise, for the piety of the one has more effect in sanctifying marriage than the impiety of the other in polluting it. Hence a believer may, with a pure conscience, live with an unbeliever, for in respect of the use and intercourse of the marriage bed, and of life generally, he is sanctified, so as not to infect the believing party with his impurity. Meanwhile this <em>sanctification </em>is of no benefit to the unbelieving party; it only serves thus far, that the believing party is not contaminated by intercourse with him, and marriage itself is not profaned. </p><p>But from this a question arises — “If the faith of a husband or wife who is a Christian <em>sanctifies </em>marriage, it follows that all marriages of ungodly persons are impure, and differ nothing from fornication.” I answer, that <em>to the ungodly all things are impure</em>, (<span class="bvs">Tit_1:15</span>,) because they pollute by their impurity even the best and choicest of God’s creatures. Hence it is that they pollute marriage itself, because they do not acknowledge God as its Author, and therefore they are not capable of true sanctification, and by an evil conscience abuse marriage. It is a mistake, however, to conclude from this that it differs nothing from fornication; for, however impure it is to them, it is nevertheless pure in itself, inasmuch as it is appointed by God, serves to maintain decency among men, and restrains irregular desires; and hence it is for these purposes approved by God, like other parts of political order. We must always, therefore, distinguish between the nature of a thing and the abuse of it. </p><p><em>Else were your children </em>It is an argument taken from the effect — “If your marriage were impure, then the children that are the fruit of it would be impure; but <em>they are holy</em>; hence the marriage also is holy. As, then, the ungodliness of one of the parents does not hinder the children that are born from being holy, so neither does it hinder the marriage from being pure.” Some grammarians explain this passage as referring to a civil sanctity, in respect of the children being reckoned legitimate, but in this respect the condition of unbelievers is in no degree worse. That exposition, therefore, cannot stand. Besides, it is certain that Paul designed here to remove scruples of conscience, lest any one should think (as I have said) that he had contracted defilement. The passage, then, is a remarkable one, and drawn from the depths of theology; for it teaches, that the children of the pious are set apart from others by a sort of exclusive privilege, so as to be reckoned <em>holy </em>in the Church. </p><p>But how will this statement correspond with what he teaches elsewhere — that <em>we are all by nature children of wrath</em>; (<span class="bvs">Eph_2:3</span>;) or with the statement of David — <em>Behold I was conceived in sin</em>, <em>etc</em>. (<span class="bvs">Psa_51:5</span>.) I answer, that there is a universal propagation of sin and damnation throughout the seed of Adam, and all, therefore, to a man, are included in this curse, whether they are the offspring of believers or of the ungodly; for it is not as regenerated by the Spirit, that believers beget children after the flesh. The natural condition, therefore, of all is alike, so that they are liable equally to sin and to eternal death. As to the Apostle’s assigning here a peculiar privilege to the children of believers, this flows from the blessing of the covenant, by the intervention of which the curse of nature is removed; and those who were by nature unholy are consecrated to God by grace. Hence Paul argues, in his Epistle to the Romans, (<span class="bvs">Rom_11:16</span>,) that the whole of Abraham’s posterity are holy, because God had made a covenant of life with him — <em>If the root be holy</em>, says he, <em>then the branches are holy also</em>. And God calls all that were descended from Israel his sons’ now that the partition is broken down, the same covenant of salvation that was entered into with the seed of Abraham <span class="cite-ref">(402)</span> is communicated to us. But if the children of believers are exempted from the common lot of mankind, so as to be set apart to the Lord, why should we keep them back from the sign? If the Lord admits them into the Church by his word, why should we refuse them the sign? In what respects the offspring of the pious are holy, while many of them become degenerate, you will find explained in <span class="bvs">Rom_10:1</span> the Epistle to the Romans; and I have handled this point there. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(402)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Auec Abraham, et auec la semence</span>;” — “With Abraham and with his seed.” </p></div></div>
