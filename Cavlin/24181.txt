<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>51.</strong><em>And, lo, the veil of the temple was rent. </em>When Luke blends <em>the rending of the veil </em>with the eclipse of the sun, he inverts the order; for the Evangelists, as we have frequently seen, are not careful to mark every hour with exactness. Nor was it proper that the <em>veil </em>should be <em>rent, </em>until the sacrifice of expiation had been completed; for then Christ, the true and everlasting Priest, having abolished the figures of the law, opened up for us by his blood the way to the heavenly sanctuary, that we may no longer stand at a distance within the porch, but may freely advance into the presence of God. For so long as the shadowy worship lasted, <span class="cite-ref">(287)</span> a <em>veil </em>was hung up before the earthly sanctuary, in order to keep the people not only from entering but from seeing it, (<span class="bvs">Exo_26:33</span>; <span class="bvs">2Ch_3:14</span>.) Now Christ, by </p><p>blotting out the handwriting which was opposed to us,<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Col_2:14</span>,) </p><p>removed every obstruction, that, relying on him as Mediator, we may all be <em>a royal priesthood, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Pe_2:9</span>.) Thus the <em>rending </em>of the <em>veil </em>was not only an abrogation of the ceremonies which existed under the law, but <em>was, </em>in some respects, an opening of heaven, that God may now invite the members of his Son to approach him with familiarity. </p><p>Meanwhile, the <em>Jews </em>were informed that the period of abolishing outward sacrifices had arrived, and that the ancient priesthood would be of no farther use; that though the building of the temple was left standing, it would not be necessary to worship God there after the ancient custom; but that since the substance and truth of the shadows had been fulfilled, the figures of the law were changed into spirit. For though Christ offered a visible sacrifice, yet, as the Apostle tells us (<span class="bvs">Heb_9:14</span>) it must be viewed spiritually, that we may enjoy its value and its fruit. But it was of no advantage to those wretched men that the outward sanctuary was laid bare by <em>the rending of the veil, </em>because the inward <em>veil </em>of unbelief, which was in their hearts, <span class="cite-ref">(288)</span> hindered them from beholding the saving light. </p><p><em>And the earth trembled, and the rocks were split. </em>What Matthew adds about the earthquake and the <em>splitting oft he rocks, </em>I think it probable, took place at the same time. In this way not only did the earth bear the testimony to its Creator, but it was even called as a witness against the hard-heartedness of a perverse nation; for it showed how monstrous that obstinacy must have been on which neither the <em>earthquake </em>nor <em>the splitting of the rocks </em>made any impression. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(287)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Cependant que le service, qui avoit les ombres de la Loy, a duré</span>;” — “so long as the service, which contained the shadows of the Law, lasted.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(288)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui estoit en leurs cœurs</span>.” </p></div></div>
