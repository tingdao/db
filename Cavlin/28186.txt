<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>But Israel, by pursuing, etc. </em>Paul openly states what seemed incredible, — that it was no wonder that the Jews gained nothing by sedulously following after righteousness; for by running out of the way, they wearied themselves in vain. But in the first place it seems to me that the law of righteousness is here an instance of transposition, and means the righteousness of the law; <span class="cite-ref">(315)</span> and then, that when repeated in the second clause, it is to be taken in another sense, as signifying the model or the rule of righteousness. </p><p>The meaning then is, — “That Israel, depending on the righteousness of the law, even that which is prescribed in the law, did not understand the true method of justification.” But there is a striking contrast in the expression, when he teaches us that the legal righteousness was the cause that they had fallen away from the law of righteousness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(315)</span> There seems to be no necessity for this transposition. “A law (not the law) of righteousness” means a law which prescribes righteousness, and which, if done, would have conferred righteousness. But the Jews following this did not attain to a law of righteousness, such a law as secured righteousness. The Apostle often uses the same words in the same verse in a different sense, and leaves the meaning to be made out by the context. [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] takes “law” as meaning way, “They followed the way of righteousness, but did not attain to a way of righteousness.” </p><p>What follows the question in the next verse stands more connected with <span class="bvs">Rom_9:30</span> than with <span class="bvs">Rom_9:31</span>; and we must consider that the word righteousness, and not law, is referred to by “it” after the verb “pursue,” which is evidently to be understood before the words, “not by faith,” etc., as the sentence is clearly elliptical. </p><p>The verb<span class="lang el-gr">διώκω, </span> rendered “sector “ by [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] <em>, </em>means strictly to pursue what flees away from us, whether a wild beast or an enemy; it signifies also to follow a leader, and to run a race, and further, to desire, to attend to, or <em>earnestly </em>to seek a thing: and in this latter sense Paul often uses it. See <span class="bvs">Rom_12:13</span>. Similar is the application of the corresponding verb, <span class="lang he-il">רדף</span> in Hebrew. See <span class="bvs">Deu_16:20</span><em>“ </em><em>Quaero </em> — <em>to </em>seek,” is the word adopted by [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] </p><p>But [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Hammond </span>] consider that there are here three agonistic terms<span class="lang el-gr">, διώκων κατέλαβε, </span> and <span class="lang el-gr">ἔφθασε. </span> The first signifies the running; the third, the reaching of the goal; and the second, the laying hold on the prize: and with this corresponds the stumbling afterwards mentioned. The Gentiles did not run at all, but the Jews did, and in running, they stumbled; while the Gentiles reached the goal, not by running, or by their own efforts, but by faith, and laid hold on the prize of righteousness. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
