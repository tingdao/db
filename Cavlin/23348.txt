<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Approaching, worshipped </em>What is the meaning of the verb <span class="lang el-gr">προσκυνεῖν</span>, which is rendered in the Latin version, <em>adorare, </em>to <em>adore </em>or <em>worship, </em>may be easily learned from this passage. For the exposition of it we may rely on the other two Evangelists, of whom <em>Mark </em>says, that he <em>fell on his knees, </em>and <em>Luke, </em>that <em>he fell down on his face </em>The outward gesture of <em>kneeling </em>was exhibited by the leper as a token of reverence. Now we know, that such marks of respect were in general use among the Jews, as the people of the East are more addicted to that kind of ceremonies. Many people accordingly think, that the leper did not intend to render to Christ divine worship, <span class="cite-ref">(489)</span> but gave him a respectful salutation as a distinguished prophet of God. </p><p>I enter into no dispute as to the feelings which moved the leper to pay reverence to Christ. But I look at what he attributed to him, that he <em>was able to cleanse him, if he were willing </em>By these words he declared, that he acknowledged a divine power in Christ: and when Christ replies, <em>I am willing, </em>he shows that he claimed more for himself than belongs to man. He who, by the mere expression of his will, restores health to men, must possess supreme authority. Whether the leper believed that Christ was the Son of God, or that he had received this power in the same manner as Moses and the other prophets, he entertains no doubt that he held in his hand, and in his power, the gift of healing. True, he speaks conditionally, <em>if thou art willing, thou art able </em>But this is not inconsistent with that certainty of faith, which God demands in our prayers: for men ought not to expect more than God promises. The leper had not learned by any inspired communication, or any promise of God, what Christ would do. It would have been improper in him, therefore, to go beyond these limits for though we sometimes read that certain persons prayed without any condition, we ought to believe that they were guided by special movements of the Spirit, <span class="cite-ref">(490)</span> which must not be taken for a general rule. I am not even certain if we are at liberty to say, strictly speaking, that the leper offered a prayer. He only declares, that he is so fully convinced of the power of Christ, as to entertain no doubt that it is in his power to cure leprosy; and then presents himself to be healed, but uncertain as to the result, because he did not yet know the <em>will </em>of Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(491)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(489)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De faire a Christ un honneur appartenant a Ia majeste divine</span>;” — “to do to Christ an honor belonging to the divine majesty.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(490)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu'il y a eu en tels personnages des mouvemens singuliers, et inspirations particulieres du S. Esprit</span>;” — “that there were in such persons singular movements, and peculiar inspirations of the Holy Spirit.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(491)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le vouloir de Christ sur sa requeste</span>;” — “the will of Christ as to his request.” </p></div></div>
