<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>64.</strong><em>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes</em>. We may easily conjecture that Isaac, when he saw the camels, turned his steps towards them, from the desire of seeing his bride; this gave occasion to the inquiry of Rebekah. Having received the answer, she immediately, for the sake of doing honor to her husband, dismounted her camel to salute him. For that she fell, struck with fear, as some suppose, in no way agrees with the narrative. She had performed too long a journey, under the protection of many attendants, to be so greatly afraid at the sight of one man. But these interpreters are deceived, because they do not perceive, that in the words of Moses, the reason is afterwards given to this effect, that when Rebekah saw Isaac, she alighted from her camel; because she had inquired of the servant who he was, and had been told that he was the son of his master Abraham. It would not have entered into her mind to make such inquiry respecting any person whom she might accidentally meet: but seeing she had been informed that Abraham’s house was not far distant, she supposes him at least to be one of the domestics. Moses also says that she took a veil: which was a token of shame and modesty. For hence also, the Latin word which signifies “to marry,” <span class="cite-ref">(12)</span> is derived, because it was the custom to give brides veiled to their husbands. That the same rite was also observed by the fathers, I have no doubt. <span class="cite-ref">(13)</span> So much the more shameful, and the less capable of excuse, is the licentiousness of our own age; in which the apparel of brides seems to be purposely contrived for the subversion of all modesty. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(12)</span> “Verbum nubendi.” The original meaning of the word nubere is <em>to veil</em>, or <em>cover</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(13)</span> “Isaac was walking, and it would therefore have been the highest breach of Oriental good manners, to have remained on the camel when presented to him.
