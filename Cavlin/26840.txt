<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>We have no king but Caesar. </em>This is a display of shocking madness, that the priests, who ought to have been well acquainted with the Law, reject Christ, in whom the salvation of the people was wholly contained, on whom all the promises depended, and on whom the whole of their religion was founded; and, indeed, by rejecting Christ, they deprive themselves of the grace of God and of every blessing. We see, then, what insanity had seized them. Let us suppose that Jesus Christ was not the Christ; <span class="cite-ref">(165)</span> still they have no excuse for acknowledging <em>no other king but Caesar. </em>For, first, they revolt from the spiritual kingdom of God; and, secondly, they prefer the tyranny of the Roman Empire, which they greatly abhorred, to a just government, such as God had promised to them. <em>Thus </em>wicked men, in order to fly from Christ, not only deprive themselves of eternal life, but draw down on their heads every kind of miseries. On the other hand, the sole happiness of the godly is, to be subject to the royal authority of Christ, whether, according to the flesh, they are placed under a just and lawful government, under the oppression of tyrants. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(165)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Jesus Christ ne fust point le Christ</span>.” </p></div></div>
