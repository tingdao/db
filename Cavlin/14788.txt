<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Let him vanish like a snail, which melts away </em>The two comparisons in this verse are introduced with the same design as the first, expressing his desire that his enemies might pass away quietly, and prove as things in their own nature the most evanescent. He likens them to <em>snails, </em><span class="cite-ref">(355)</span> and it might appear ridiculous in David to use such contemptible figures when speaking of men who were formidable for their strength and influence, did we not reflect that he considered God as able in a moment, without the slightest effort, to crush and annihilate the mightiest opposition. Their power might be such as encouraged them, in their vain-confidence, to extend their schemes into a far distant futurity, but he looked upon it with the eye of faith, and saw it doomed in the judgment of God to be of short continuance. He perhaps alluded to the suddenness with which the wicked rise into power, and designed to dash the pride which they are apt to feel from such an easy advance to prosperity, by reminding them that their destruction would be equally rapid and sudden. There is the same force in the figure employed in the end of the verse where they are compared to <em>an abortion. </em>If we consider the length of time to which they contemplate in their vain-confidence that their life shall extend, <span class="cite-ref">(356)</span> they may be said to pass out of this world before they have well begun to live, and to be dragged back, as it were, from the very goal of existence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(355)</span> The original word for <em>snail </em>occurs only in this instance in the whole Bible. The LXX. render it <span class="lang el-gr">ὡσεὶ κηρὸς</span>, <em>as wax</em>, and the Syriac and Vulgate follow them. But the Chaldee reads “as a reptile,” interpreting the word as meaning some creeping thing, which affords an eminent example of melting, and this seems to apply to the snail, which, in its progress from its shell, leaves a slime in its track till it altogether melts away and dies. Comp. <span class="bvs">Job_3:16</span></p><p><span class="cite-note">(356)</span> “Si reputamus quantum temporis inani fiducia devorent,” etc. Literally, “If we consider how much time they devour in their vain-confidence,” etc. The French version adheres to this translation of the mere words. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si nous regardons combien ils devorent de temps par leur vaine confiance</span>.” We have hazarded the more free translation given in the text, because this seems one of those instances where the brevity of the Latin idiom demands explanation, in order that the idea may be intelligible in any other language. </p></div></div>
