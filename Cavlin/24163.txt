<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_27:33</span><strong>.</strong><em>And they came to the place. </em>Jesus was <em>brought to the place </em>where it was customary to execute criminals, that his death might be more ignominious. Now though this was done according to custom, still we ought to consider the loftier purpose of God; for he determined that his Son should be cast out of the city as unworthy of human intercourse, that he might admit us into his heavenly kingdom with the angels. For this reason the apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, (<span class="bvs">Heb_13:12</span>,) refers it to an ancient figure of the law. For as God commanded his people to <em>burn without the camp </em>the bodies of those animals, the blood of which was carried into the sanctuary to make atonement for sins, (<span class="bvs">Exo_29:14</span>; <span class="bvs">Lev_16:27</span>;) so he says that Christ went out of the gate of the city, that, by taking upon him the curse which pressed us down, he might be regarded as accursed, and might in this manner atone for our sins. <span class="cite-ref">(272)</span> Now the greater the ignominy and disgrace which he endured before the world, so much the more acceptable and noble a spectacle did he exhibit in his death to God and to the angels. For the infamy of the place did not hinder him from erecting there a splendid trophy of his victory; nor did the offensive smell of the carcasses which lay there hinder the sweet savor of his sacrifice from diffusing itself throughout the whole world, and penetrating even to heaven. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(272)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et effeçast nos peche, et en fist la satisfaction</span>;” — “and might blot out our sins, and make satisfaction for them.” </p></div></div>
