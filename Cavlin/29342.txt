<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Servants, be obedient. </em>His exhortation to servants is so much the more earnest, on account of the hardship and bitterness of their condition, which renders it more difficult to be endured. And he does not speak merely of outward obedience, but says more about <em>fear </em>willingly rendered; for it is a very rare occurrence to find one who willingly yields himself to the control of another. The <em>servants </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">δοῦλοι</span>) whom he immediately addresses were not hired servants, like those of the present day, but <em>slaves, </em>such as were in ancient times, whose <em>slavery </em>was perpetual, unless, through the favor of their masters, they obtained freedom, — whom their masters bought with money, that they might impose upon them the most degrading employments, and might, with the full protection of the law, exercise over them the power of life and death. To such he says, <em>obey your masters, </em>lest they should vainly imagine that carnal freedom had been procured for them by the gospel. </p><p>But as some of the worst men were compelled by the dread of punishment, he distinguishes between Christian and ungodly servants, by the feelings which they cherished.<em>With fear and trembling; </em>that is, with the careful respect which springs from an honest purpose. It can hardly be expected, however, that so much deference will be paid to a mere man, unless a higher authority shall enforce the obligation; and therefore he adds,<em>as doing the will of God. </em>(Ver. 6.) Hence it follows, that it is not enough if their obedience satisfy the eyes of men; for God requires truth and sincerity of heart. When they serve their masters faithfully, they obey God. As if he had said, “Do not suppose that by the judgment of men you were thrown into slavery. It is God who has laid upon you this burden, who has placed you in the power of your masters. He who conscientiously endeavors to render what he owes to his master, performs his duty not to man only, but to God.” </p></div>
