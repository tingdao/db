<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet applies again to the present state of the people what he had before recorded—that God went forth with his Christ for the salvation of his people. Some consider that there is understood a particle of comparison, and repeat the verb twice, “As thou didst then go forth for the deliverance of thy people, so now wilt thou go forth for the deliverance of thy people with thy Christ.” But this repetition is strained. I therefore take the words of the Prophet simply as they are—that God went forth for the deliverance of his people. But when God’s people are spoken of, their gratuitous adoption must ever be remembered. How was it that the children of Abraham became the peculiar people of God? Did this proceed from any worthiness? Did it come to them naturally? None of these things can be alleged. Though then they differed in nothing from other nations, yet God was pleased to choose them to be a people to himself. By the title, the people of God, is therefore intimated their adoption. Now this adoption was not temporary or momentary, but was to continue to the end. Hence it was easy for the faithful to draw this conclusion—that they were to hope from God the same help as what he had formerly granted to the fathers. </p><p><em>Thou wentest forth</em>, he says, <em>for the salvation, for the salvation of thy people</em>. He repeats the word salvation, and not without reason; for he wished to call attention to this point, as when he had said before—that God had not in vain manifested, by so many miracles, his power, as though he were angry with the sea and with rivers, but had respect to the preservation of his people. Since then the salvation of the Church has ever been the design of God in working miracles, why should the faithful be now cast down, when for a time they were oppressed by adversities? for God ever remains the same: and why should they despond, especially since that ancient deliverance, and also those many deliverances, of which he had hitherto spoken, are so many evidences of his everlasting covenant. These indeed ought to be connected with the word of God; that is, with that promise, according to which he had received the children of Abraham into favor for the purpose of protecting them to the end. “For salvation, for salvation,” says the Prophet, and that of his elect people. </p><p>He adds, <em>with thy Christ</em>. This clause still more confirms what Habakkuk had in view—that God had been from the beginning the deliverer of his people in the person of the Mediator. When God, therefore, delivered his people from the hand of Pharaoh, when he made a way for them to pass through the Red Sea, when he redeemed them by doing wonders, when he subdued before them the most powerful nations, when he changed the laws of nature in their behalf—all these things he did through the Mediator. For God could never have been propitious either to Abraham himself or to his posterity, had it not been for the intervention of a Mediator. Since then it has ever been the office of the Mediator to preserve in safety the Church of God, the Prophet takes it now for granted, that Christ was now manifested in much clearer light than formerly; for David was his lively image, as well as his successors. God then gave a living representation of his Christ when he erected a kingdom in the person of David; and he promised that this kingdom should endure as long as the sun and moon should shine in the heavens. Since, then, there were in the time of Habakkuk clearer prophecies than in past times respecting the eternity of this kingdom, ought not the people to have taken courage, and to have known of a certainty that God would be their Deliverer, when Christ should come? We now then apprehend the meaning of the Prophet. <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> But I cannot now go farther; I shall defer the subject until tomorrow. </p><p><strong>(61)</strong> However true is what is said here, it seems not to be the doctrine of this text. The version of <em>Aquila </em>and the <em>Vulgate </em>have been followed as to the second clause of the verse. The <em>Septuagint </em>read<span class="lang el-gr">, του σωσαι τον χριστον σου—</span> to save thy Christ;” or, according to Alex. cod., “thy Christs<span class="lang el-gr">—τους χριστους σου;</span> ” or, according to Barb. MS., “thine elect<span class="lang el-gr">—τους εκλεκτους σου.</span> ” Five Hebrew MSS. have [<span class="lang he-il">משיחיד</span> ], “thine anointed ones.” But if “people” in the preceding line; or it may refer to Joshua and his successors, the singular being used, as it is often done by the Prophets, in the collective sense. The particle [<span class="lang he-il">את</span> ] before it is not often used as a preposition; and the word [<span class="lang he-il">ישע</span> ] may better be taken here as a verb, according to the <em>Septuagint</em>, than as a noun, though as a verb it most commonly occurs in <em>Hiphil</em>: but see <span class="bvs">1Sa_23:5</span>; <span class="bvs">2Sa_8:6</span>. The following would then be the version— </p><p>Go forth didst thou to save thy people, <LineBreak />To save thine anointed: <LineBreak />Thou didst smite the head from the house of the wicked, <LineBreak />Emptying out the foundation even to the neck. </p><p>The reference in the two lines is evidently to the rooting out of the Canaanites, and not, as <em>Newcome </em>thinks, to the destruction of the firstborn in Egypt. The singular is poetically used for the plural: “head,” instead of heads, or chiefs, etc. The last line seems to be a proverbial saying, signifying an entire demolition, the very foundation being dug up, though so deep as to reach up to man’s neck. There is no MSS. nor version to countenance [<span class="lang he-il">צור</span> ], “rock,” which <em>Houbigant </em>and <em>Newcome </em>adopt.—<em>Ed. </em></p></div>
