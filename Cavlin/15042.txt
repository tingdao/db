<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>For my heart was in a ferment. </em>The Psalmist again returns to the confession which he had previously made, acknowledging that whilst he felt his heart pierced with perverse envy and emulation, he had complained against God, in a peevish or fretful manner. He compares his anger to <em>leaven. </em>Some translate, <em>My heart was steeped in vinegar. </em>But it is more suitable to explain the verb thus, <em>My heart was soured </em>or <em>swollen, </em>as dough is swollen by leaven. Thus Plautus, when speaking of a woman inflamed with anger, says that she is all in a ferment. <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span> Some read the last clause of the verse, <em>My reins were pierced; </em>and they think that <span class="lang he-il">א</span>, <em>aleph, </em>in the beginning of the word, <span class="lang he-il">אשתונן</span>, <em>eshtonan, </em>the verb for <em>pierced, </em>is put instead of <span class="lang he-il">ה</span>, <em>he; </em><span class="cite-ref">(203)</span> but this makes little difference as to the sense. We know that the word <span class="lang he-il">כליות</span>, <em>kelayoth, </em>by which the Hebrews denote <em>the reins, </em>comes from the verb <span class="lang he-il">כלא</span>, <em>kalah, </em>which signifies <em>to desire, to covet earnestly, </em>this word being put for the reins, because it is said that the desires of man have their seat in that part of the body. David therefore declares that these perplexing and troublesome thoughts had been, as it were, thorns which pierced him. <span class="cite-ref">(204)</span> We have already stated how he came to be affected with this pungent and burning vexation of spirit. We will find many worldly men who, although they deny that the world is governed by the Providence of God, yet do not greatly disquiet themselves, but only laugh at the freaks of Fortune. On the other hand, true believers, the more firmly they are persuaded that God is the judge of the world, are the more afflicted when his procedure does not correspond to their wishes. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(202)</span> Plautus’ words are, “Mea uxor tota in fermento jacet;” “My wife lies all in a ferment.” In like manner he says, “Ecquid habet acetum in pectore ?” “Has he any vinegar in his breast?” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(203)</span> This is Kimchi’s and Houbigant’s opinion. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(204)</span> “The Hebrew verb [for <em>pierced </em>] indicates the acute pain felt from a sharp weapon. (See Parkhurst, on <span class="lang he-il">שנן</span>, iv.) Common experience shows that the workings of the mind, particularly the passions of joy, grief, and fear, have a very remarkable effect on the reins or kidneys.” — <em>Mant </em></p></div></div>
