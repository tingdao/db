He now comes to speak of public prayers also. “If he that frames or utters forth prayers in the name of the people is not understood by the assembly, how will the common people add an expression of their desires in the close, so as to take part in them? For there is no fellowship in prayer, unless when all with one mind unite in the same desires. The same remark applies to <em>blessing, </em>or giving thanks to God.” </p><p>Paul’s expression, however, intimates, <span class="cite-ref">(837)</span> that some one of the ministers uttered or pronounced prayers in a distinct voice, and that the whole assembly followed in their minds the words of that one person, until he had come to a close, and then they all said <em>Amen </em>— <em>to </em>intimate, that the prayer offered up by that one person was that of all of them in common. <span class="cite-ref">(838)</span> It is known, that <em>Amen </em>is a Hebrew word, derived from the same term from which comes the word that signifies <em>faithfulness </em>or <em>truth. </em><span class="cite-ref">(839)</span> It is, accordingly, a token of confirmation, <span class="cite-ref">(840)</span> both in alarming, and in desiring. <span class="cite-ref">(841)</span> Farther, as the word was, from long use, familiar among the Jews, it made its way from them to the Gentiles, and the Greeks made use of it as if it had belonged originally to their own language. Hence it came to be a term in common use among all nations. Now Paul says — “If in public prayer thou makest use of a foreign tongue, that is not understood by the<em>unlearned </em>and the common people among whom thou speakest, there will be no fellowship, and thy <em>prayer </em>or <em>blessing </em>will be no longer a public one.” “Why?” “No one,” says he, “<em>can </em>add his <em>Amen to </em>thy prayer or psalm, if he does not understand it.” </p><p>Papists, on the other hand, reckon that to be a sacred and legitimate observance, which Paul so decidedly rejects. In this they discover an amazing impudence. Nay more, this is a clear token from which we learn how grievously, and with what unbridled liberty, Satan rages in the dogmas of Popery. <span class="cite-ref">(842)</span> For what can be clearer than those words of Paul — than an <em>unlearned </em>person cannot take any part in public prayer if he does not understand what is said? What can be plainer than this prohibition — “let not prayers or thanksgivings be offered up in public, except in the vernacular tongue.” In doing every day, what Paul says should not, or even cannot, be done, do they not reckon <em>him </em>to be <em>illiterate </em>? In observing with the utmost strictness what he forbids, do they not deliberately contemn God? We see, then, how Satan sports among them with impunity. Their diabolical obstinacy shows itself in this — that, when admonished, they are so far from repenting, that they defend this gross abuse by fire and sword. </p><p><strong>(837)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Signifie et presuppose</span>;” — “Intimates and presupposes.” </p><p><strong>(838)</strong> “‘<em>Amen</em>, ’ or ‘So be it,’ was, among the Jews, used by the congregation at the end of a <em>prayer </em>or <em>blessing</em>, to denote their assent to, or appropriation of, that which one person had pronounced. Many instances of this practice occur in the Old Testament. From the Jewish Synagogue this, with many other customs of worship, passed to the Christian Church, in which it is still generally retained. Justin Martyr particularly notices the unanimous and loud ‘Amen’ at the conclusion of the Lord’s Supper, observing, that when the minister had finished the prayer and the thanksgiving, all the people present, with a joyful exclamation, said ‘Amen.’ — (Apol. volume 2.)” <em>llustrated Commentary</em>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(839)</strong> The word to which Calvin. refers is <span class="lang he-il">אמן</span>, (<em>Amen</em>)<em>truth </em>The term occurs in <span class="bvs">Isa_65:16</span>, <span class="lang he-il">אלחי אמן</span>, (<em>Elohe Amen</em>,)<em>the God of truth </em></p><p><strong>(840)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Confirmation et approbation</span>;” — “Confirmation and approbation.” </p><p><strong>(841)</strong> “Amen,” says <em>Witsius</em>, in his Dissertations on the Lord’s Prayer, “is a Hebrew particle, expressive both of strong affection and of ardent desire. <em>Luther</em>, with his wonted liveliness of manner, wrote to <em>Melancthon </em>in the following terms: — ‘I pray for you, I have prayed, and I will pray, and I have no doubt I shall be heard, for I feel the Amen in my heart.’” — <em>Biblical Cabinet</em>, volume 24. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(842)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par lequel nous voyons comment Satan a tenu ses rangs, et domine en la Papaute furieusement, et d’une license merueilleusement desbordee</span>;” — “From which we see how Satan has maintained his place, and has ruled in Popery with fury, and with a liberty amazingly reckless.” </p></div>
