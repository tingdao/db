<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18</strong><em>There is no fear </em>He now commends the excellency of this blessing by stating the contrary effect, for he says that we are continually tormented until God delivers us from misery and anguish by the remedy of his own love towards us. The meaning is, that as there is nothing more miserable than to be harassed by continual inquietude, we obtain by knowing God’s love towards us the benefit of a peaceful calmness beyond the reach of fear. It hence appears what a singular gift of God it is to be favored with his love. Moreover from this doctrine, he will presently draw an exhortation; but before he exhorts us to duty, he commends to us this gift of God, which by faith removes our fear. </p><p>This passage, I know, is explained otherwise by many; but I regard what the Apostle means, not what others think. They say that there is no fear in love, because, when we voluntarily love God, we are not constrained by force and fear to serve him. Then according to them, servile fear is here set in opposition to voluntary reverence; and hence has arisen the distinction between servile and filial fear. I indeed allow it to be true, that when we willingly love God as a Father, we are no longer constrained by the fear of punishment; but this doctrine has nothing in common with this passage, for the Apostle only teaches us, that when the love of God is by us seen and known by faith, peace is given to our consciences, so that they no longer tremble and fear. </p><p>It may, however, be asked, when does perfect love expel fear, for since we are endued with some taste only of divine love towards us, we can never be wholly freed from fear? To this I answer, that, though fear is not wholly shaken off, yet when we flee to God as to a quiet harbor, safe and free from all danger of shipwreck and of tempests, fear is really expelled, for it gives way to faith. Then fear is not so expelled, but that it assails our minds, but it is so expelled that it does not torment us nor impede that peace which we obtain by faith. </p><p><em>Fear hath torment </em>Here the Apostle amplifies still further the greatness of that grace of which he speaks; for as it is a most miserable condition to suffer continual torments, there is nothing more to be wished than to present ourselves before God with a quiet conscience and a calm mind. What some say, that servants fear, because they have before their eyes punishment and the rod, and that they do not their duty except when forced, has nothing to do, as it has been already stated, with what the Apostle says here. So in the next clause, the exposition given, that he who fears is not perfect in love, because he submits not willingly to God, but would rather free himself from his service, does not comport at all with the context. For the Apostle, on the contrary, reminds us, that it is owing to unbelief when any one fears, that is, has a disturbed mind; for the love of God, really known, tranquilizes the heart. <span class="cite-ref">(88)</span></p><p><strong>(88)</strong><em>Beza</em>, <em>Doddridge</em>, <em>Scott</em>, and most commentators, regard <em>love </em>here as that which is in us, and not the love of God as apprehended by faith. The <em>main </em>subject of the Apostle is love in us, and the words “perfected” and “<em>perfect</em>, ” as applied to it, seem inappropriate to God’s love towards us; and this perfection is said in verse 17<span class="cite-ref">th</span> to consist in this, that as God is, so are we in this world; that is, like him in love, as God is said in the previous verse to be love. </p><p>“Fear” is the fear of judgment, mentioned in verse 17<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, and he who fears is said to be not perfected or made perfect in love, which obviously refers to love in us. And then it immediately follows, “We <em>love </em>him,” and the reason is assigned, “because he first loved us.” He afterwards proceeds to show the indispensable necessity of having love to God and to the brethren — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
