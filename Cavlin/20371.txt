<div class="comment-content"><p>Many renderings are given of these words’ there is, however, no over-statement here; for, as it has been often said, the grief of the people under such a mass of evils could not be sufficiently expressed. The Prophet, no doubt, extended here his hand to the weak, who would have otherwise lain down as dead; for under such evils the ruin of the whole nation, the fall of the city, and the destruction of the temple, it could not be but such thoughts as these must have occurred. Now, as to any one unacquainted with such a trial, he would soon succumb, had no remedy been presented to him. The Prophet then dictates for all the godly such complaints as they might, so to speak, pour forth confidently and freely into the bosom of God. </p><p>We hence see that here is even expressed whatever might occur to the minds of God’s children, so that they might not hesitate in their straits to direct their prayers to God, and freely confess whatever they suffered in their souls. For shame closes up the door of access; and thus it happens; that we make a clamor as though God were far away from us; hence impatience breaks out almost to a rage. But when an access to God is opened to us, and we dare to confess what burdens our minds, this, as I have said, is the best way for obtaining relief and comfort. We must then understand the design of the Prophet, that he suggests words to the faithful, that they might freely cast their cares and sorrows on God, and thus find some alleviation. </p><p>For this reason, he says that his teeth had been broken by a little stone or pebble. <span class="cite-ref">(178)</span> The same expression, if I mistake not, is found in Job. It is a metaphor taken from those who press stones instead of bread under their teeth; for when grit lies hid in bread, it hurts the teeth. Then inward and hidden griefs are said to be like small stones, which break or shatter the teeth. For the Prophet does not speak here of large stones, but on the contrary he speaks of pebbles or small stones, which deceive men, for they lie hid either in bread or in meat, or in any other kind of food. As, then, the teeth are hurt by pressing them, so the Prophet says that his sorrows were most bitter, as that part, as it is well known, is very tender; and when any injury is done to the teeth, the pain spreads instantly almost through the whole body. This is the reason why he says that his teeth were broken. </p><p>Then he adds, that he was <em>covered with dust, </em>or that he was lying down or dragged along in the dust. The expression is taken from those who are drawn by way of reproach along the ground, as a carcass is, or some filthy thing which we abhor. <span class="cite-ref">(179)</span> Thus the Prophet complains that there was nothing short of extreme evils. He adds, — </p><p><strong>(178)</strong> The word means grit or gravel, rendered “pebble” by the Sept., and “stones” by the Syr. and the Targ. It is rendered “gravel” in <span class="bvs">Pro_20:17</span>. The verb only occurs here and in <span class="bvs">Psa_119:0</span>; and to wear out, is its most suitable meaning, — </p><p>And he hath worn out with grit my teeth. </p><p>— <em>Ed </em></p><p><strong>(179)</strong> The verb rendered “covered,” is found only here, and is translated “fed” by the <em>Sept</em>. and <em>Vulg</em>. ; “tumbled” or laid low, by the Targ.; and “besprinkled,” by the <em>Syr</em>. As he had said, that his food had been as it were grit, he could not have said that he was fed with ashes. Therefore the <em>arg</em>. or the <em>Syr</em>. is the most suitable, that God had laid him low in ashes, <em>Tr </em>that he had besprinkled or covered him with ashes. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
