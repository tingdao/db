<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>Set thou over him a wicked person. </em><span class="cite-ref">(305)</span> Hitherto he poured out his complaint against a vast number of persons; now he seems to direct it against a single individual. Probably he speaks of each of them individually. It is, however, equally probable that he refers in very marked terms to some one in particular among these wicked persons, the most notorious transgressor of any of them. Some conjecture, and not without reason, that Doeg is the person here aimed at, who, by his treason and revolt, sought to bring ruin, not only upon David, but also upon all the holy priests; and we know that this psalm is applied by Peter to Judas, (<span class="bvs">Act_1:20</span>) But with equal propriety, and certainly not less forcibly, may this complaint be considered as applicable to some most intimate and particular friend of the Psalmist. Respecting the imprecations contained in this psalm, it will be proper to keep in mind what I have said elsewhere, that when David forms such maledictions, or expresses his desires for them, he is not instigated by any immoderate carnal propensity, nor is he actuated by zeal without knowledge, nor is he influenced by any private personal considerations. These three matters must be carefully weighed, for in proportion to the amount of self-esteem which a man possesses, is he so enamoured with his own interests as to rush headlong upon revenge. Hence it comes to pass, that the more a person is devoted to selfishness, he will be the more immoderately addicted to the advancement of his own individual interests. This desire for the promotion of personal interest gives birth to another species of vice. For no one wishes to be avenged upon his enemies because that such a thing would be right and equitable, but because it is the means of gratifying his own spiteful propensity. Some, indeed, make a pretext of righteousness and equity in the matter, but the spirit of malignity, by which they are inflamed, effaces every trace of justice, and blinds their minds. </p><p>When these two vices, selfishness and carnality, are corrected, there is still another thing demanding correction, the repressing the ardor of foolish zeal, in order that we may follow the Spirit of God as our guide. Should any one, under the influence of perverse zeal, produce David as an example of it, that would not be an example in point; for to such a person may be very aptly applied the answer which Christ returned to his disciples, “Ye know not what spirit ye are of,” <span class="bvs">Luk_9:55</span>. How detestable a piece of sacrilege is it on the part of the monks, and especially the Franciscan friars, to pervert this psalm by employing it to countenance the most nefarious purposes! If a man harbour malice against a neighbor, it is quite a common thing for him to engage one of these wicked wretches to curse him, which he would do by daily repeating this psalm. I know a lady in France who hired a parcel of these friars to curse her own and only son in these words. </p><p>But I return to David, who, free from all inordinate passion, breathed forth his prayers under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Then, as to the ungodly, who live as the contemners of God, and who are constantly plotting the overthrow of the unsuspecting and the good, casting off all restraint, so that neither modesty nor honesty proves a check to them, surely they are deserving of the punishment of <em>having a wicked person set over them </em>And since, by means of intrigue and perfidy, they are constantly aiming at the extermination of the good, they are most justly punished by God, who raises up against them an adversary that should never depart from their side. Only let believers be on their guard, lest they should betray too much haste in their prayers, and let them rather leave room for the grace of God to manifest itself in their behalf; because it may turn out that the man, who to-day bears towards us a deadly enmity, may by to-morrow through that grace become our friend. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(305)</span> Dr Geddes translates the 6<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse thus: — </p><p>“May he be tried by a wicked judge;<LineBreak />And at his right had be placed the accuser.” </p><p>On which he has the following note: — “<em>May he be tried by a wicked judge. </em>He alludes to courts of judicature: and wishes that his enemy may have a<em>severe, </em>nay, <em>wicked </em>judge, — certainly one of the greatest curses that can befall one. — <em>And at his right hand be placed the accuser. </em>Instead of a friend or advocate to stand by him, let his only attendant be an accuser. What imagery this! But the height of the metaphor is in the next verse: — </p><p>‘When he is judged, may he be found guilty:<LineBreak />And may his deprecation only aggravate his crime.’” </p><p>With this corresponds the interpretation of Phillips. With Hammond, he understands <em>to set over </em>as denoting <em>to set over as a judge </em>or <em>inspector. </em>“This notion of setting over,” he observes, “corresponds with the next member; for there it says, <em>and an enemy shall stand at his right hand, </em>which shows that the wicked man was to be appointed to act as a judge. The man at his right hand denotes an accuser, agreeably to the custom which prevailed in a Jewish court of justice, of placing the accuser at the right hand of the accused, (see <span class="bvs">Zec_3:1</span>;) and hence we understand in this verse <span class="lang he-il">רשע</span> to be mentioned as acting in the capacity of a judge, and <span class="lang he-il">רטן</span> in that of an accuser.” Cresswell gives a similar explanation of the passage. Green, who follows Dr Sykes in thinking that the imprecations from this verse to verse 17 were pronounced not by David upon his enemies, but by David’s enemies upon him, reads the verse thus: — “Set a wicked man over him, <em>say they, to hear his cause, </em>and let a false accuser stand at his right hand.” </p></div></div>
