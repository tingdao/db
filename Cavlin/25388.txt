<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_10:24</span><strong>.</strong><em>Many Prophets and Kings have desired to see. </em>The condition of the Church, at the present day, is justly pronounced to be preferable to that of the holy fathers, who lived under the Law; because to them was exhibited, under shadows and figures only, what is now openly manifested in the shining face of Christ. <em>The vail of the temple being rent, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_27:51</span>,) we enter by faith into the heavenly sanctuary, and are freely permitted to approach to God. Although the fathers were satisfied with their lot, and enjoyed a blessed peace in their own minds, yet this did not prevent their desires from extending farther. Thus, Abraham <em>saw the day of Christ </em>afar off, <em>and rejoice, </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_8:56</span>,) and yet longed to enjoy a nearer view, but did not obtain his wish. Simeon spoke the sentiments of all, <span class="cite-ref">(191)</span> when he said, <em>Now thou sendest thy servant away in peace, </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_2:29</span>.) And indeed it was impossible that, under the burden of that curse by which the human race is crushed, they should be otherwise than altogether inflamed with the desire of a promised deliverance. <span class="cite-ref">(192)</span> Let us therefore learn, that they breathed after Christ, like hungry persons, and yet possessed a serene faith; so that they did not murmur against God, but kept their minds in patient expectation till the full time of revelation. </p><p><strong>(191)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Simeon disoit selon l’affection de tours les Peres</span>;” — “Simeon spoke according to the feeling of all the Fathers.” </p><p><strong>(192)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et de faict, il ne se pouvoit faire que ces bons personnages ne fussent tous ravis, et comme enflambez d’un grand desir de la delivrance promise</span>.” — “And indeed it was impossible that those good men should not be altogether transported, and as it were inflamed with a great desire of the promised deliverance.” </p></div>
