<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>The disciples having taken him by night. </em>There is a question moved here, whether it were lawful for the disciples to save Paul thus or no? and also, whether it were lawful for Paul to escape danger by this means or no? For the laws say that the walls of cities are holy, [sacred,] and that the gates are holy. Therefore, he ought rather to have suffered death, than to have suffered a public order to be broken for his sake. I answer, that we must consider why it is decreed by the laws that the walls should not be violated; to wit, that the cities may not be laid open to murders and robberies, and that the cities may be free <span class="cite-ref">(613)</span> from treason. That reason ceaseth when the question is concerning the delivery of an innocent man. Therefore, it was no less lawful for the faithful to be let down in a basket, than it shall be lawful for any private person to leap over a wall, that he may avoid <span class="cite-ref">(614)</span> the sudden invasion of the enemy. Cicero doth handle this latter member, and he setteth down very well, that although the law forbid a stranger to come near the wall, yet doth not he offend who shall go up upon the wall to save the city, because the laws must always be inclined <span class="cite-ref">(615)</span> to equity. Therefore Paul is not to be blamed, because he escaped by stealth, seeing that he doth that without raising any tumult amongst the people. Nevertheless, we see how the Lord useth to humble those that be his, seeing that Paul is enforced to steal his life from the watchmen of the city if he will save himself. Therefore, he reckoneth this example amongst his infirmities. He was acquainted betime with the cross <span class="cite-ref">(616)</span> with this first exercise. </p><p><strong>(613)</strong> “Tuti,” safe. </p><p><strong>(614)</strong> “Propulset,” repel. </p><p><strong>(615)</strong> “Flectandae,” bent. </p><p><strong>(616)</strong> “Hoc tirocinio ad crucem ferendam mature assuefactus fuit.” He was early trained to bear the cross by this first trial. </p></div>
