<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>When thou shalt pass through the waters. </em>This is an anticipation by which he declares that they who rely on God’s immediate assistance have no reason for sinking under adversity. That is stated more fully than in the preceding verse, because while he shews that the Church will not be exempt from calamities and afflictions, but must maintain a constant warfare, he encourages to patience and courage; as if he had said, “The Lord hath not redeemed thee that thou mightest enjoy pleasures and luxuries, or that thou mightest abandon thyself to ease and indolence, but rather that thou shouldest be prepared for enduring every kind of evils.” </p><p>By <em>fire </em>and<em>water </em>he means every kind of miseries to which we are liable in this life; for we must contend not with calamities of one kind only, but with infinitely diversified calamities. At one time we must “pass through wares” and at another “through fire.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_66:12</span>.) In like manner the Apostle James exhorts believers not to faint when they “fall into various temptations.” (<span class="bvs">Jas_1:2</span>.) And, indeed, faith needs to be put to the trial in many ways; for it often happens that he who has been victorious in one combat has been baffled by another kind of temptation. We are therefore tried by afflictions, but are at length delivered; we are baffled by the billows, but are not swallowed up; we are even scorched by the flames, but are not consumed. We have, indeed, the same feeling of pain as other men, but we are supported by the grace of God, and fortified by the spirit of patience, that we may not faint; and at length he will stretch out his hand and lift us up on high. <span class="cite-ref">(163)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(163)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Jusqu’ ace qu’il nons esleve en haut a soy</span>.” “Till he raise us on high to himself.” </p></div></div>
