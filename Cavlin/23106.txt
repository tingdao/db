<div class="comment-content"><p>He then adds, <em>If ye will not hear nor lay it to heart to give glory to my name</em>, <em>etc</em>. He seems here to threaten the priests alone; and yet if any one carefully considers the whole passage, he will easily perceive that this address extends to the whole people, in such a way however that it is in the first place directed to the priests; for as I have said the greater portion of the guilt belonged to them. God then denounces a heavy punishment on the whole people as well as on the priests, even that he would <em>send a curse</em>. But that they might not object and say that they were too severely dealt with, God shows how justly he was displeased with them, because they hearkened not nor attended to his warnings. What indeed is less tolerable than not to hear God speaking? But as many thought it enough to stretch the ear, and then immediately to forget what had been spoken, it is added, <em>If ye lay it not to heart</em>, that is, If ye attend not and seriously apply your hearts to what is said. We see then that the Prophet shows how that God had a just cause for severely punishing them; for it was an impiety not to be borne, when he could obtain no hearing from men. But the Prophet shows at the same time what it is to hear God; he therefore adds the latter clause as a definition or an explanation of the former: for God is not heard, if we receive with levity his words, so that they soon vanish away; but we hear them when we lay them on the heart, or, as the Latins say, when we apply the mind to them. There is then required a serious attention, otherwise it will be the same as though the ears were closed against God. </p><p>Let us further learn from this passage that obedience is of so much account with God, that he bears nothing less than a contempt of his word or a careless attention to it, as though we regarded not its authority. We must also notice that our guilt before God is increased and enhanced, when he recalls us to the right way, and seeks to promote our welfare by warning and exhorting us. When therefore God is thus kindly careful for our salvation, we are doubly inexcusable, if we perversely reject his teaching, warnings, counsels, and other remedies which he may apply. </p><p>He now adds, <em>I will send on you a curse</em>; and this curse he immediately explains, <em>I will curse your blessings </em><span class="cite-ref">(213)</span> The word blessing, we know, means everywhere in Scripture the beneficence or kindness of God. God then is said to bless us when he bountifully supports us and supplies whatever is necessary for us. And hence seems to have arisen the expression, that God by his nod alone can satisfy us with all abundance of good things. By blessings then he means a large and an abundant provision, and also rest from enemies, a healthy air, and everything of this kind. Some think that those prayers are intended, by which the priest blessed the people; but there is no reason for this. God then had manifested his favor to the Jews; he now declares that he will deprive them of all his benefits, that they might know that he is not propitious to them. Blessings then are evidences of God’s bounty and paternal favor. </p><p>But he immediately adds, <em>Yea, I have cursed</em>. By which words he proves their senselessness: for they were not even taught by their evils, which yet produce some effect even on fools, who, according to the common proverb, begin to be wise when they are chastised. God then here reproves the stupidity of the Jews; for they had already been deprived of his benefits, and they might have known by experience that he was not propitious to them, but on the contrary an angry judge; and yet they were touched by no penitence, according to what we have seen in the other Prophets. </p><p>We now understand the import of the words, and at the same time the object of the Prophet: <em>I will </em>then <em>curse your blessings, and what is more</em>, (so I explain, <span class="lang he-il">וגם</span>, <em>ugam</em>,) <em>I have already cursed </em>them: but ye are like blocks of wood or stones; for the very scourges avail nothing with you. He again repeats, <em>because ye lay it not on your heart</em>, in order to show that he could not bear the contempt of his word, for it was, as we have said, a sign of extreme impiety. It follows </p><p><strong>(213)</strong> It is “your blessing” in one MS., in the <em>Septuagint</em>, the <em>Targum</em>, and <em>Arabic</em>; and this reading is confirmed by “it” in the next line. By “blessing,” says <em>Newcome</em>, “is meant the portion of the priests:” and as the priests are especially addressed, this is probable. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
