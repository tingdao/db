<div class="comment-content"><p>The three Evangelists relate the Baptist’s discourse in the same words. In one respect, Luke’s account is more full: for he opens it by explaining the occasion on which this discourse was delivered. It arose from the people being in danger of being led, by a false opinion, to convey to him the honor which was due to Christ. To remove, as soon as possible, every occasion of such a mistake, he expressly declares, that he is not the Christ, and draws such a distinction between Christ and himself as to maintain Christ’s prerogative. He would have done this of his own accord, by <em>handing them over, to </em>use a common expression, as disciples to Christ: but he takes up the matter at an earlier stage, lest, by remaining silent any longer, he should confirm the people in an error. </p><p><em>He who cometh after me is stronger than I </em>Christ is thus declared to be so far superior in power and rank, that, with respect to him, John must occupy a private station. <span class="cite-ref">(282)</span> He uses ordinary forms of speech to magnify the glory of Christ, in comparison of whom he declares that he himself is nothing. The chief part of his statement is, that he represents Christ as the author of spiritual baptism, and himself as only the minister of outward baptism. He appears to anticipate an objection, which might be brought forward. What was the design of the Baptism which he had taken upon himself? For it was no light matter to introduce any innovation whatever into the Church of God, and particularly to bring forward a new way of introducing persons into the Church, which was more perfect than the law of God. He replies, that he did not proceed to do this without authority; but that his office, as minister of an outward symbol, takes nothing away from the power and glory of Christ. </p><p>Hence we infer, that his intention was not at all to distinguish between his own baptism, and that which Christ taught his disciples, and which he intended should remain in perpetual obligation in his Church. He does not contrast one visible sign with another visible sign, but compares the characters of master and servant with each other, and shows what is due to the master, and what is due to the servant. It ought not to have any weight with us, that an opinion has long and extensively prevailed, that John’s baptism differs from ours. We must learn to form our judgment from the matter as it stands, and not from the mistaken opinions of men. And certainly the comparison, which they imagine to have been made, would involve great absurdities. It would follow from it, that the Holy Spirit is given, in the present day<em>, </em>by ministers. Again, it would follow that John’s baptism was a dead sign, and had no efficacy whatever. Thirdly, it would follow, that we have not the same baptism with Christ: for it is sufficiently evident, that the fellowship, which he condescends to maintain with us, was ratified by this pledge, <span class="cite-ref">(283)</span> when he consecrated baptism in his own body. </p><p>We must therefore hold by what I have already said, that John merely distinguishes, in this passage, between himself and the other ministers of baptism, on the one hand, and the power of Christ, on the other, and maintains the superiority of the master over the servants. And hence we deduce the general doctrine, as to what is done in baptism by men, and what is accomplished in it by the Son of God. To men has been committed nothing more than the administration of an outward and visible sign: the reality dwells with Christ alone. <span class="cite-ref">(284)</span></p><p>Scripture does sometimes, though not in a literal sense, <span class="cite-ref">(285)</span> ascribe to men what John here declares not to belong to men, but claims exclusively for Christ. In such cases, however, the design is not to inquire, what man has separately and by himself, but merely to show, what is the effect and advantage of signs, and in what manner God makes use of them, as instruments, by his Spirit. Here also is laid down a distinction between Christ and his ministers, that the world may not fall into the mistake, of giving to them what is justly due to him alone: for there is nothing to which they are more prone, than to adorn creatures with what has been taken from God by robbery. A careful attention to this observation will rid us of many difficulties. We know what disputes have arisen, in our own age, about the advantage and efficacy of signs, all of which may be disposed of in a single word. The ordinance of our Lord, viewed as a whole, includes himself as its Author, and the power of the Spirit, together with the figure and the minister: but where a comparison is made between our Lord and the minister, the former must have all the honor, and the latter must be reduced to nothing. </p><p><span class="bvs">Mat_3:11</span><strong>.</strong><em>He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire </em>It is asked, why did not John equally say, that it is Christ alone who washes souls with his blood? The reason is, that this very washing is performed by the power of the Spirit, and John reckoned it enough to express the whole effect of baptism by the single word <em>Spirit </em>The meaning is clear, that Christ alone bestows all the grace which is figuratively represented by outward baptism, because it is he who “sprinkles the conscience” with his blood. It is he also who mortifies the old man, and bestows the Spirit of regeneration. The word <em>fire </em>is added as an epithet, and is applied to the Spirit, because he takes away our pollutions, <em>as fire </em>purifies gold. In the same manner, he is metaphorically called <em>water </em>in another passage, (<span class="bvs">Joh_3:5</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(282)</span> “In ordinem cogendus sit.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il faut qu'il baissc la teste</span>.” — “He must bow the head.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(283)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A este confirme et ratifie par ce signe</span>;” — “was confirmed and ratified by this sign.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(284)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La verite du Baptesme vient et procede du Christ seul</span>.” — “The truth of Baptism comes and proceeds from Christ alone.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(285)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Improprie</span>.” </p></div></div>
