<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>And they shall come from the east </em>He now draws a larger illustration from the fact, that the Jews, who reckoned themselves the only lawful heirs of God, were to be rejected, and that the Gentiles were to be substituted in their room, and obtain the life which was promised to Abraham and his posterity. He contrasts the Gentiles with them, in order to excite them to faith by a holy jealousy: as Paul writes, that </p><p>“it will be a distinguished honor of his ministry, if he excite any of his nation and blood to such an emulations,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_11:13</span>.) </p><p>The Jews must have been stung by it: for they had an inordinate love of themselves, and proudly despised God and his gifts. But as we shall, ere long, meet with this sentence again in the Gospel by Matthew I now glance at it more slightly. </p></div>
