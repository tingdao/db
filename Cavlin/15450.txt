<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>If I said, My foot has fallen </em>What is said in this verse confirms the preceding statement. The more to commend God’s kindness and power, he declares that it was no common danger from which he had been rescued, but in a manner from present death. The import of the language is, that death stared him so full in view, that he despaired of himself; as Paul speaks of having had the message of death in himself, when his condition was desperate, and he had given up hope of life, (<span class="bvs">2Co_1:9</span>.) The fact of the Psalmist having been delivered after he had considered death certain, made the Divine interposition the more conspicuous. If we understand him as speaking of temporal death only in the expression, <em>My foot has fallen </em>— there is nothing unaccountable in the circumstance of his having despaired, <span class="cite-ref">(37)</span> as God often prolongs the life of his people in the world, when they had lost hope, and were preparing for their departure. Possibly, however, the Psalmist only means that this was the language of sense; and this is the more probable, because we have already seen that he never ceased praying to God — a proof that he had still some hope. The next verse affords still further proof, for there he tells us that his afflictions were always mixed with some comfort. By <em>thoughts, </em>he means anxious and perplexing cares, which would have overwhelmed him had not consolation been communicated to him from above. We learn this truth from the passage, That God interposes in behalf of his people, with a due regard to the magnitude of their trials and distresses, and at the very moment which is necessary, enlarging them in their straits, as we find stated in other places. The heavier our calamities grow, we should hope that Divine grace will only be the more powerfully manifested in comforting us under them, (<span class="bvs">Psa_4:1</span>,) But should we through weakness of the flesh be vexed and tormented by anxious cares, we must be satisfied with the remedy which the Psalmist here speaks of in such high terms. Believers are conscious of two very different states of mind. On the one hand, they are afflicted and distressed with various fears and anxieties; on the other, there is a secret joy communicated to them from above, and this in accommodation to their necessity, so as to preserve them from being swallowed up by any complication or force of calamity which may assail them. </p><p><strong>(37)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si nous entendons le </span><em class="lang fr-fr">glissement du pied</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, seulement de la mort corporelle, il ne sera point absurde de dire que le Prophere ait este en ce desespoir</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
