<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>He said to me. </em>It is not certain, whether he had this answer by a special revelation, and it is not of great importance. <span class="cite-ref">(910)</span> For God answers us, when he strengthens us inwardly by his Spirit, and sustains us by his consolation, so that we do not give up hope and patience. He bids Paul be <em>satisfied with his grace, </em>and, in the mean time, not refuse chastisement. Hence we must bear up under evil of ever so long continuance, because we are admirably well dealt with, when we have the grace of God to be our support. <span class="cite-ref">(911)</span> The term <em>grace, </em>here, does not mean here, as it does elsewhere, the favor of God, but by <em>metonymy, </em>the aid of the Holy Spirit, which comes to us from the unmerited favor of God; and it ought to be <em>sufficient </em>for the pious, inasmuch as it is a sure and invincible support against their ever giving way. </p><p><em>For my strength </em>Our weakness may seem, as if it were an obstacle in the way of God’s perfecting his strength in us. Paul does not merely deny this, but maintains, on the other hand, that it is only when our weakness becomes apparent, that God’s <em>strength </em>is duly <em>perfected. </em>To understand this more distinctly, we must distinguish between God’s strength and ours; for the word <em>my </em>is emphatic. “<em>My </em>strength,” says the Lord, (meaning that which helps man’s need — which raises them up when they have fallen down, and refreshes them when they are faint,) “is perfected in the weakness of men;<em>” </em>that is, it has occasion to exert itself, when the weakness of men becomes manifest; and not only so, but it is more distinctly recognized as it ought to be. For the word <em>perfected </em>has a reference to the perception and apprehension of mankind, because it is not <em>perfected </em>unless it openly shines forth, so as to receive its due praise. For mankind have no taste of it, unless they are first convinced of the need of it, and they quickly lose sight of its value, if they are not constantly exercised with a feeling of their own weakness. </p><p><em>Most gladly, therefore </em>This latter statement confirms the exposition that I have given. <em>I will glory, </em>says he,<em>in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me </em><span class="cite-ref">(912)</span> Hence, the man that is ashamed of this glorying, shuts the door upon Christ’s grace, and, in a manner, puts it away from him. For <em>then </em>do we make room for Christ’s grace, when in true humility of mind, we feel and confess our own weakness. The <em>valleys </em>are watered with rain to make them fruitful, while in the mean time, the high summits of the lofty mountains remain dry. <span class="cite-ref">(913)</span> Let that man, therefore, become a <em>valley, </em>who is desirous to receive the heavenly rain of God’s spiritual grace. <span class="cite-ref">(914)</span></p><p>He adds<em>most gladly, </em>to show that he is influenced by such an eager desire for the grace of Christ, that he refuses nothing for the sake of obtaining it. For we see very many yielding, indeed, submission to God, as being afraid of incurring sacrilege in coveting his glory, but, at the same time, not without reluctance, or at least, less cheerfully than were becoming. <span class="cite-ref">(915)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(910)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Et aussi il n’est pas fort requis de la scauoir</span>;” — “And besides, it is not greatly requisite to know it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(911)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Et c’est assez</span>;” — “And that is enough.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(912)</span> The original word, <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπισκηνώσὟ,</span> properly means, to <em>pitch a tent, or tabernacle, upon. </em>Raphelius quotes two passages from Polybius, in which the verb is used as meaning — to <em>enter into, and dwell in. </em><span class="lang el-gr">Τὸ δὲ τελευτασῖον ἐπισωκηνώσαντες ἐπὶ τὰς οἰκίας </span> “and at last, having <em>entered in, and taken possession of </em>the houses.” <span class="lang el-gr">Μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ταῖς οἰκίαις ἐπισκηνώσαντες κατεῖχον τὴν πόλιν </span> — “And after these things, having <em>entered into </em>the houses, they took possession of the city.” — CEcumenius, cited by Parkhurst, considers <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπίσκηνώσὟ,</span> as employed by the Apostle here, to be equivalent to <span class="lang el-gr">ὁλη ἐν ὁλω κατοικήσὟ </span> — “may <em>entirely take possession of,me, and dwell in me. </em>” — <em>It </em>is admirably well observed by Dr. Adam Clarke, that “the same <em>Eternal </em>WORD,” (of whom it is said in <span class="bvs">Joh_1:14</span>, that he “was made flesh, and <em>made his tabernacle among us, ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν ἡμῖν,</span>) full of grace and truth,”) “promised to make his <em>tabernacle </em>with the Apostle, and gives him a proof that he was still the <em>same </em>— <em>full of grace and truth, </em>by assuring him that his <em>grace should be sufficient for him. </em>” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(913)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><em class="lang fr-fr">Sees et steriles </em>;” — “Dry and barren.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(914)</span> Much in accordance with this beautiful sentiment is Bunyan’s description of the “Valley of Humiliation,” in the <em>second </em>part of his “Pilgrim’s Progress.” “It is the best and most fruitful piece of ground in all these parts.
