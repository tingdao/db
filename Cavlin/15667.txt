<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>He gave them their desire </em>There is a fine paronomasia in the word <span class="lang he-il">רזון</span>, <em>razon, </em>for if, instead of <span class="lang he-il">ז</span>, <em>zain, </em>we read <span class="lang he-il">ץ</span><em>, tsädhé, </em>the word would signify <em>good pleasure. </em>The prophet, therefore, in allusion to their lusting, by a word which is very similar to good pleasure or desire, says that <em>God sent leanness into their souls; </em>meaning by that, that he had indeed gratified the inordinate desires of the people, in such a way, however, as that those who had loathed the manna, now received nothing but leanness. <span class="cite-ref">(246)</span> Thus the prophet would seem to charge the people with what we daily observe among those who live luxuriously and are fastidious, especially when their stomach, in consequence of the fluids poured into it, being vitiated, has no relish for wholesome food. For such persons only relish that food which is pernicious; and, therefore, the more they pamper themselves with it, so much the more do they become the creatures of noxious habits; and thus in a very short time, the very food itself makes them pine away. The prophet, seems, therefore, to apply to the mind what he says about the unhealthy state of the body, and to compare the Jews to those morbid persons, whose voraciousness, instead of promoting health, injures it, because they do not derive any nourishment from their food. The reason is, that God withheld his blessing from the food which they had so immoderately longed for, in order that this their punishment for their transgression might humble them. But their perversity is seen to be very great, in that even this mode of punishing them did not overcome their stubborn hearts. It is a proverbial saying, that fools learn wisdom from the experience of evil. How insane and incorrigible must they have been, whom even compulsion itself could not reform! </p><p><strong>(246)</strong> The reference here is to the quails which God granted to the people in answer to their request for flesh, but which, from the excess in which they partook of them, so far from affording nourishment, proved the cause of disease. When food of an unwholesome quality, or too much of that which is wholesome, is eaten, nature with much violence seeks to throw it off from the system by the several evacuations, upon which follows a sudden and almost incredible deprivation of strength and flesh. The Israelites, when God gave them the quails, having indulged their appetite to an immoderate degree, (<span class="bvs">Exo_16:8</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_78:25</span>,) the effect was their being seized with a sudden and wasting sickness, which is supposed by some to have been what is called cholera, a disease which produces a rapid prostration of strength and emaciation of the whole frame. This opinion seems confirmed from what is stated in <span class="bvs">Num_11:20</span>, where it is threatened that the quails should “come out at their nostrils,” probably indicating the violent vomitings which accompany that malady. It is indeed said, that the <em>Lord smote </em>the people with a very great plague, <span class="bvs">Num_11:33</span>. But God’s agency, and even his miraculous agency, admits of the subserviency of means. French and Skinner read the clause, “But sent a wasting disease among them.” “The word <span class="lang he-il">רזה</span>, <em>to attenuate, emaciate, </em>” says Hammond, “is used also for <em>destroying, </em><span class="bvs">Zep_2:11</span>, when God threatens that he will <em>emaciate, i.e., destroy all the gods. </em>And then <span class="lang he-il">רזון</span>, may be rendered, more generally, destruction or plague, and so R. Tanchum on Zephaniah renders it <em>destruction. </em>” </p></div>
