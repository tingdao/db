<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Cursed be he that setteth light by his father</em>. What follows refers to the Second Table of the Law; and, first, He pronounces those cursed who should be undutiful ( <em>impii</em>) to their parents; for the word <span class="lang he-il">קלל</span>, <em>kalal</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(201)</span> which means to despise, as well as to curse, is put in opposition to the honor which, by the Fifth Commandment, is due to our father and mother. Then He mentions such thefts as generally escape the knowledge of men; as also, He only adverts to those acts of fornication which are anxiously concealed on account of their filthiness. To have connection with a beast, with one’s mother-in-law, or step-mother, or sister, is so unnatural and detestable a crime, that it is generally concealed more carefully. But God admonishes us that, whatever modes of concealment the sinner shall adopt, they will profit him nothing, but that, when He shall at length <em>ascend </em>His judgment-seat, their shame shall be discovered. For the same reason he does not curse all murderers, but only such as have shed innocent blood for hire, which nefarious compact cannot easily be discovered so as to be punished by laws. <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(201)</span> He assumes, what is scarcely tenable, that <span class="lang he-il">מקלה</span> is derived from <span class="lang he-il">קלל</span> rather than from <span class="lang he-il">קלה</span><span class="cite-note">—</span><em>W </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(202)</span> “Des hommes.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
