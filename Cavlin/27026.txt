<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And many of them which heard </em>The apostles are put in prison, but the force of their preaching is spread far and wide, and the course thereof is at liberty. Of which thing Paul boasteth very much, that the Word of God is not bound with him, (<span class="bvs">2Ti_2:9</span>.) And here we see that Satan and the wicked have liberty granted them to rage against the children of God; yet can they not (maugre their heads <span class="cite-ref">(203)</span>) prevail, but that God doth further and promote the kingdom of his Son; Christ doth gather together his sheep; and that a few men unarmed, furnished with no garrisons, do show forth more power in their voice alone, than all the world, by raging against them. This is, indeed, no common work of God, that one sermon brought forth such plentiful fruit; but this is the more to be wondered at, that the faithful are not terrified with the present danger, and discouraged from taking up the cross of Christ together with the faith. For this was a hard beginning for novices. Christ did more evidently declare by this efficacy and force of doctrine that he was alive, than if he should have offered his body to be handled with hand, and to be seen with the eyes. And whereas it is said that the number of those which believed did grow to be about five thousand, I do not understand it of those which were newly added, but of the whole church. </p><p><strong>(203)</strong> “Omnia machinando,” by all their machinations. </p></div>
