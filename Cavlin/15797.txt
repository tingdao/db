<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>His work is beautiful </em>Others render it <em>splendor. </em>The meaning of the clause is this, That every act of God is replete with glorious majesty. In the following part of the verse he specifies more clearly in what this beauty and magnificence consist, by stating that <em>the justice of God </em>is everywhere conspicuous. It is not the design of God to furnish us with such a display of his power and sovereignty in his works, as might only fill our minds with terror, but he also gives us a display of his justice in a manner so inviting as to captivate our hearts. This commendation of the works and ways of God is introduced in opposition to the clamor and calumny of the ungodly, by which they impiously endeavor, to the utmost extent of their power, to disfigure and deface the glory of the works of God. In the next verse, he more especially extols the wonderful works in which God has principally set forth his power. <em>To cause his marvellous works to be remembered, </em>is equivalent to the doing of works worthy of being remembered, or the renown of which shall continue for ever. <span class="cite-ref">(338)</span> And having above called upon us to contemplate his justice, now, in like manner, and almost in like terms, he celebrates the grace and mercy of God, principally in relation to his works, because that justice which he displays in the preservation and protection of his people, issues from the source of his unmerited favor which he bears towards them. </p><p><strong>(338)</strong> “<span class="lang he-il">זכר עשה</span>. He hath made a memorial for himself in his wonderful works. <span class="lang he-il">זכר</span>, the same as <span class="lang he-il">זכרון</span> in <span class="bvs">Num_17:5</span>. So the LXX., in <span class="bvs">Exo_17:14</span>, render <span class="lang he-il">זכר</span> by <span class="lang el-gr">ὄνομα</span><em>, name</em>; accordingly, <span class="lang he-il">זכר עשה</span> may signify, <em>He hath made himself a name</em>; <em>i.e</em>. , His wonderful works will exist as memorials of his name.” — <em>Phillips. </em></p></div>
