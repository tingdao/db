<div class="comment-content"><p>Then follows the reason — <em>For thou hast forsaken me, saith Jehovah </em>Since, then, God had been rejected by the Jews, did not such a defection bring its deserved reward, when they were deprived of every human aid? He afterwards adds, <em>Backward hast thou gone </em>He intimates that there was a continuance in their wicked defection; for they not only forgot God for a time, but departed far from him, so as to become wholly alienated. </p><p>It then follows — <em>And I will stretch out, etc.</em>; that is, “therefore will I stretch out,” etc.; for the copulative is to be taken here as an inative. This may be viewed as in the past or the future tense; for God had in a measure already afflicted the people; but heavier judgments awaited them. I am inclined to regard it as a prediction of what was to come, as it immediately follows, <em>I am weary with repenting, </em>that is, “I have so often repented that I cannot possibly be induced now to forgive; for I see that I have been so often deceived, that I camlot hear to be deceived any longer.” Some, indeed, give this version, — “I am weary with consoling myself,” and <span class="lang he-il">נחם</span>, <em>nuchem, </em>means both; but the other sense seems to me the most suitable. I doubt not then but that the Prophet means repentance. We indeed know that God changes not his purpose; for men repent because their expectation often disappoints them, when things happen otherwise than they had thought; but no such thing can happen to God; and he is said to repent according to our apprehensions. God then repents of his severity whenever he mitigates it towards his people, whenever he withdraws his hand from executing his vengeance, whenever he forgives sins. And this had been often done to the Jews; but they had made a mock of such mercy, and the oftener God spared them the more audaciously did they provoke his wrath. Hence he says, “I am weary with repenting so often;” that is, that he had so often spared them and suspended his judgment. <span class="cite-ref">(133)</span></p><p>In short, he deprives the Jews of every excuse, and shews that they acted impiously when they murmured against God, for they allowed no place to his mercy; nay, whenever they found him recentliable they abused his forbearance with extreme indignity and perverseness. It follows — </p><p><strong>(133)</strong> The verse may be thus rendered, — </p><p><strong>6.</strong>Thou hast broken loose from me, saith Jehovah; Backward dost thou walk; But I will stretch my hand over thee and destroy thee; I have become wearied with repenting. </p><p>The verb here used, commonly rendered “forsake,” means to loose oneself from restraints: the Jews were bound, as it were, to God by covenant; they broke loose from this bond, they freed themselves from this tie, and went back to idolatry. “Walk,” though future, is to be taken here as present. The last line in the <em>Septaugint </em>is as follows — “I will no longer release them;” and in the <em>Syriac</em>, “I will no longer spare them.” The verb <span class="lang he-il">הנחם</span> seems to have been taken as coming from <span class="lang he-il">נח</span> with an <span class="lang he-il">ם</span> affixed, and put here in Hiphil — “I m wearied with causing them to rest,” or, “with forbearing,” as rendered by <em>Blayney</em>. But our version, which is that of <em>Calvin</em>, seems preferable, and is adopted by <em>Piscator, Grotius</em>, and <em>Venema</em>. The last indeed proposes the joining of this line with the next verse, which <em>Blayney </em>has adopted, and in that case he prefers the reading of the <em>Septuagint </em>and <em>Syriac</em>. Then the passage would be, — </p><p>I am wearied with forbearing them, <em>or</em>, with suffering them to rest; <LineBreak /><strong>7.</strong>And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land. </p><p>He truly says that there is a kind of contrast between the suffering of them to rest quietly, and the fanning of them in the gates of land for the purpose of dispersing them. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
