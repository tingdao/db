<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>In the day when I cried to thee, </em>etc. Frequently God prevents our prayers, and surprises us, as it were, sleeping: but commonly he stirs us up to prayer by the influence of his Spirit, and this to illustrate his goodness the more by our finding that he crowns our prayers with success. David well infers that his escape front danger could not have been merely fortuitous, as it plainly appeared that God had answered him. This then is one thing noticeable, that our prayers more nearly discover his goodness to us. Some supply a copulative in the second part of the verse — Thou <em>hast increased me, and in my soul is strength. </em>But this is not called for, since the words read well enough as they stand, whether we render the passage as I have done above, or translate it, <em>Thou hast multiplied, </em>or <em>increased, me with strength in my soul. </em>The sense, is, That from a weak and afflicted state he had received fresh strength to his spirit Or some may, perhaps, prefer resolving it thus: Thou hast multiplied — that is, blest me, whence strength in my soul. </p></div>
