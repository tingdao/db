<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong>But here ariseth a question, seeing that the misery was common to all, why ought they rather to have succored one people than all the rest? I answer, that forasmuch as Judea was impoverished with great destructions of wars and other miseries, the men of Antioch were not without cause more moved with the miseries of the brethren which were there; secondly, the greater the rage of the enemies was, the more wretched was the estate of the brethren. Finally, Paul doth sufficiently declare, in the Epistle to the Galatians, that Judea had certain especial necessities, whereof all other had regard, not without cause, (<span class="bvs">Gal_3:0</span>) And this thankfulness deserved no small commendations, in that the men of Antioch thought that they ought to help the needy brethren, from whom they had received the gospel. For there is nothing more just than that those should reap earthly things who have sown spiritual things. As every man is too much bent to provide for himself, every man might readily have excepted and objected: Why shall not I rather provide for myself? But when they call to mind how greatly they are indebted to the brethren, omitting that carefulness, <span class="cite-ref">(745)</span> they turn themselves to help them. In sum, this alms had a double end; for the men of Antioch did the duty of charity toward their needy brethren and they did also testify by this sign, what great account they made of the gospel, whilst that they honored the place whence it came. </p><p><em>As every man was able. </em>We see the men of Antioch observe in this place that mean which Paul prescribeth to the Corinthians, (<span class="bvs">2Co_8:6</span>,) whether they did this of themselves, or being instructed by him; and it is not to be doubted, but that he continued like to himself <span class="cite-ref">(746)</span> in both places. Therefore we must follow this rule, that every one, considering how much is granted him, impart the same courteously with his brethren, as one that must give an account; so shall it come to pass, that he which is but poor shall have a liberal mind, and that a small reward <span class="cite-ref">(747)</span> shall be counted a fat and gorgeous sacrifice. By this word <em>determined, </em>Luke giveth us to understand that their oblation was voluntary. Which thing ought so to be, as Paul teacheth, that we reach out our hand unto the needy not as constrained, but cheerfully, (<span class="bvs">2Co_9:7</span>.) When as he nameth every one, it is all one as if he should say, that one did not prescribe another a law, neither did they burthen one another with their prejudice, but that every man did bestow his liberality as seemed good to himself; and we must note the word <span class="lang el-gr">διακονιας</span>, whereby we are taught that rich men have greater abundance given them upon that condition, that they may be the ministers of the poor in the dispensation committed to them by God. Lastly, Luke teacheth that the blessing was sent not to all the whole nation, but only to those that were of the household of faith, not because we ought never to use any bountifulness, or courtesy towards the unbelievers, seeing love ought to extend itself unto all mankind, but because those ought to be preferred whom God hath joined and linked to us move near, and with a more holy band. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(745)</span> “Immodica illa anxietate,” that excessive anxiety. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(746)</span> “Sibi constiterit,” is consistent with himself. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(747)</span> “Munus,” gift. </p></div></div>
