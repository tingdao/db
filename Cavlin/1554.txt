<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>He made them houses. </em><span class="cite-ref">(23)</span> It is not at all my opinion that this should be expounded as referring to the women, and I am surprised that many interpreters have been grossly mistaken on so dear a point. All are agreed that the pronoun is masculine, and therefore, according to ordinary usage, should refer to males; but because the two letters <span class="lang he-il">ם</span> and <span class="lang he-il">ן</span> are sometimes used interchangeably, they have supposed that the two clauses of the verse must be connected, and both referred to the women. But there is no need of this, since the sentence runs very well in this way: — “The people multiplied and waxed very mighty, and it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that God made <em>them </em>houses,” <em>i e</em>. , the Israelites; as much as to say, that through the piety of these women, they obtained an abundant offspring. And because some saw that a suitable meaning could not be elicited by this false interpretation, they have imagined that, by the inspiration of God, well-fortified houses were built them by the people, where they might be secure from the attacks of their enemies. Nothing can be more puerile than this conceit. But lest readers should puzzle themselves unnecessarily on this not very perplexing point, let us inquire what the Hebrews meant by this expression, “to make houses.” When God promises ( <span class="bvs">1Sa_2:35</span>) that he will build for Samuel “a sure house,” there is no question that he refers to a stable priesthood. Again, when he declares ( <span class="bvs">2Sa_7:27</span>) that he will build a house for David; and when a little afterwards we read in David’s prayer, (v. 27,) “thou hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house,” the royal dignity is clearly to be understood. It is plain, too, from the address of Abigail, that this was a common mode of speaking, where she says, ( <span class="bvs">1Sa_25:28</span>,) “the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house.” Now, it is quite unsuitable to the female sex and name that a woman should be made head of a family. Whence it appears that the words are forcibly <span class="cite-ref">(24)</span> wrested if we say that God made a house for the midwives; but it will be most applicable to the whole people, that it was multiplied by God, until it arose like a perfect building to its full height. The conclusion is, that the Israelites owed to the exertions of two women the fact, not only that they survived and were preserved, but also that they flourished more and more, in order that thus the glory of God might shine forth with greater brightness, since he so marvelously preserved his people when very near destruction by these weak instruments. But Moses puts the word “houses” in the plural number, because the people were built up by the increase of the offspring of separate families. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(23)</span> The accuracy of Calvin’s criticism is undeniable, namely, — that as the Hebrew pronoun is of the masculine form, ordinary usage would forbid our considering this clause to be spoken of the midwives; and yet that the masculine and feminine pronominal affixes, distinguished respectively by a final <span class="lang he-il">ם</span> or <span class="lang he-il">ן</span>, are not used with such inflexible regularity as to preclude all debate. In fact, Moses has used the masculine pronoun <span class="lang he-il">ם</span> at the end of <span class="bvs">Exo_2:17</span> of the next chapter, where a feminine pronoun should have been expected. In the clause under consideration, <em>V</em>. has the ambiguous pronoun <em>eis</em>, whilst the LXX. has <span class="lang el-gr">ἐποίησαν ἑαυταῖς</span>, which is a departure from the Hebrew text in both words. — <em>W </em></p><p>The gloss in the Geneva Bible is, — “<em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , God increased the families of the Israelites by their means.” Lightfoot, Harmony 2. 108, on the contrary, explains the expression, “For which, their piety, God marrieth them to Israelites, for they were Egyptian women, and builded up Israelitish families by them.” “Triplex hic difficultas, (says Poole,) 1. Quis fecit? 2. Quibus? 3. Quid?” The balance of comments appears to favor Calvin’s solution. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(24)</span> “Tire par les cheveux;” dragged by the hair. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
