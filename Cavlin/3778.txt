Therefore, those are said to enter into the sanctuary who are fit to exercise the priesthood; and hence the expression, “for the service,” <span class="cite-ref">(426)</span> is added. </p><p>Inasmuch as the inequality (of their charges) might have been the source of envy, God’s authority is asserted at the end of the chapter, where Moses records that he was only acting ministerially, and that he distributed the offices among them according to God’s command. </p><p><strong>(426)</strong> “For the work.” — <em>A.
