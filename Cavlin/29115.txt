<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Christ hath redeemed us</em>. The apostle had made all who are under the law subject to the curse; from which arose this great difficulty, that the Jews could not free themselves from the curse of the law. Having stated this difficulty, he meets it, by shewing that Christ hath made us free, which still farther aids his purpose. If we are saved, because we have been freed from the curse of the law, then righteousness is not by the law. He next points out the manner in which we are made free. </p><p><em>It is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree</em>. Now, Christ hung upon the cross, therefore he fell under that curse. But it is certain that he did not suffer that punishment on his own account. It follows, therefore, either that he was crucified in vain, or that our curse was laid upon him, in order that we might be delivered from it. Now, he does not say that Christ was cursed, but, which is still more, that he was <em>a curse</em>, — intimating, that the curse “of all men <span class="cite-ref">(59)</span> was laid upon him” (<span class="bvs">Isa_53:6</span>.) If any man think this language harsh, let him be ashamed of the cross of Christ, in the confession of which we glory. It was not unknown to God what death his own Son would die, when he pronounced the law, “He that is hanged is accursed of God.” (<span class="bvs">Deu_21:23</span>.) </p><p>But how does it happen, it will be asked, that a beloved Son is cursed by his Father? We reply, there are two things which must be considered, not only in the person of Christ, but even in his human nature. The one is, that he was the unspotted Lamb of God, full of blessing and of grace; the other is, that he placed himself in our room, and thus became a sinner, and subject to the curse, not in himself indeed, but in us, yet in such a manner, that it became necessary for him to occupy our place. He could not cease to be the object of his Father’s love, and yet he endured his wrath. For how could he reconcile the Father to us, if he had incurred his hatred and displeasure? We conclude, that he “did always those things that pleased” (<span class="bvs">Joh_8:29</span>) his Father. Again, how would he have freed us from the wrath of God, if he had not transferred it from us to himself? Thus, “he was wounded for our transgressions,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_53:5</span>,) and had to deal with God as an angry judge. This is the foolishness of the cross, (<span class="bvs">1Co_1:18</span>,) and the admiration of angels, (<span class="bvs">1Pe_1:12</span>,) which not only exceeds, but swallows up, all the wisdom of the world. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(59)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La malediction de tous hommes</span>.” </p></div></div>
