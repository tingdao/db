<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>We have sent with him the brother. </em>The circumstance that <em>three </em>persons are sent, is an evidence, that great expectations were entertained respecting the Corinthians, and it became them to be so much the more attentive to duty, that they might not disappoint the hopes of the Churches. It is uncertain, however, who this <em>second </em>person was; only that some conjecture that it was Luke, others that it was Barnabas. Chrysostom prefers to consider it to have been Barnabas. I agree with him, because it appears that, by the suffrages of the Churches, <span class="cite-ref">(690)</span> he was associated with Paul as a companion. As, however, it is almost universally agreed, that Luke was one of those who were the bearers of this Epistle, I have no objection that he be reckoned to be the <em>third </em>that is made mention of. </p><p>Now the second person, whoever he may be, he honors with a signal commendation, that he had conducted himself as to the gospel in a praiseworthy manner, that is, he had earned applause by promoting the gospel. For, although Barnabas gave place to Paul in the department of <em>speaking, </em>yet in <em>acting </em>they both concurred. He adds farther, that he had received praise, not from one individual, or even from one Church merely, but from all the Churches. To this general testimony he subjoins a particular one, that is suitable to the subject in hand — that he had been chosen for this department by the concurrence of the Churches. Now it was likely, that this honor would not have been conferred upon him, had he not been long before known to be qualified for it. We must observe, however, the mode of election — that which was customary among the Greeks — <span class="lang el-gr">χειροτονία</span>, (<em>a show of hands</em>,) <span class="cite-ref">(691)</span> in which the leaders <span class="cite-ref">(692)</span> took the precedence by authority and counsel, and regulated the whole proceeding, while the common people intimated their approval. <span class="cite-ref">(693)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(690)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par le commun accord des Eglises</span>;” — “By the common agreement of the Churches.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(691)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Laquelle les Grecs appellent d’vn nom qui signifie Eleuation des mains</span>;” — “Which the Greeks express by a term that signifies a show of hands.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(692)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les principaux ou gouerneurs</span>;” — “The leaders or governors.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(693)</span><em>Beza, </em>in his Annotations on <span class="bvs">Act_14:23</span>, when commenting on the word <span class="lang el-gr">χειροτονήσαντες </span> made use of in that passage in connection with the <em>ordaining </em>of elders in every Church, remarks, that the word in this application took its rise from the practice of the Greeks — “qui porrectis manibus suffragia ferebant: unde illud Ciceronis pro L. Flacco, <em>Porrexerunt mantus: psephisma nature est </em>;” — “Who gave their votes by holding up their hands: hence that statement made by Cicero in his Oration in behalf of L.
