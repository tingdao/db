<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>51.</strong><em>Have you understood all these things? </em>We must keep in recollection what we have formerly seen, that all the parables of Christ were explained in private. And now the Lord, after having taught them in this kind and familiar manner, warns them at the same time, that his object, in taking so much pains to instruct them, was not merely that they might be well informed, <span class="cite-ref">(234)</span> but that they might communicate to others what they had received. In this way he whets and excites their minds more and more to desire instruction. He says that teachers <em>are like householders, </em>who are not only careful about their own food, but have a store laid up for the nourishment of others; and who do not live at ease as to the passing day, but make provision for a future and distant period. The meaning, therefore, is, that the teachers of the Church ought to be prepared by long study for giving to the people, as out of a storehouse, <span class="cite-ref">(235)</span> a variety of instruction concerning the word of God, as the necessity of the case may require. Many of the ancient expositors understand by <em>things new and old </em>the Law and the Gospel; but this appears to me to be forced. I understand them simply to mean a varied and manifold distribution, wisely and properly adapted to the capacity of every individual. </p><p><strong>(234)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’ils gardent ceste cognoissance pour eux-mesmes seulement</span>;” — “that they may keep that knowledge for themselves only.” </p><p><strong>(235)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Commoe nous voyons que le pere de famille tire de son cellier ou grenier toutes sortes de provisions</span>;” — “as we see that the master of a family draws from his cellar or granary all kinds of provisions.” </p></div>
