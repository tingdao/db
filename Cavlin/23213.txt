<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_4:3</span><strong>.</strong><em>And when he, who tempteth, had approached to him. </em>This name, <span class="lang el-gr">ὁ πειράζων</span>, <em>the tempter, </em>is given to Satan by the Spirit for the express purpose, that believers may be more carefully on their guard against him. Hence, too, we conclude, that temptations, which solicit us to what is evil, come from him alone: for, when God is sometimes said to <em>tempt </em>or <em>prove, </em>(<span class="bvs">Gen_22:1</span>; <span class="bvs">Deu_13:3</span>,) it is for a different purpose, namely, to try their faith, or to inflict punishment on unbelievers, or to discover the hypocrisy of those who do not sincerely obey the truth. </p><p><em>That these stones may become loaves. </em>Here the ancients amused themselves with ingenious trifles. The first temptation, they said, was to gluttony; the second, to ambition; and the third, to covetousness. But it is absurd to suppose that it arises from the intemperance of gluttony, <span class="cite-ref">(310)</span> when a hungry person desires food to satisfy nature. What luxury will they fancy themselves to have discovered in the use of bread, that one who satisfies himself, as we say, with dry bread, must be reckoned an epicure? But not to waste more words on that point, Christ’s answer alone is sufficient to show, that the design of Satan was altogether different. The Son of God was not such an unskillful or inexperienced antagonist, as not to know how he might ward off the strokes of his adversary, or idly to present his shield on the left hand when he was attacked on the right. If Satan had endeavored to allure him by the enticements of gluttony, <span class="cite-ref">(311)</span> he had at hand passages of Scripture fitted to repel him. But he proposes nothing of this sort. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(310)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Friandise ou gourmandise</span>;” — “epicurism or gormandizing.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(311)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A friandise, ou a quelque excez de la bouche</span>.” — “To epicurism, or any excess of the palate.” </p></div></div>
