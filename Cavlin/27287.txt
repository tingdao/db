<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Ye know that it is not lawful. </em>This seemeth to be no friendly preface, and such as may rather harden <span class="cite-ref">(681)</span> than win their hearts, when as they hear that they are accounted so unclean, that with their familiarity and conference they pollute the saints; which must needs be a great reproach for them. But it was needful for Peter thus to speak, lest they should suspect that he had an evil conscience, because, contrary to the custom delivered by the fathers, he came. <span class="cite-ref">(682)</span> But when as he affirmeth that he was sent of God, all such suspicion is taken away and purged. Moreover, he mitigateth very well by these words the offense which did stick in their minds, by reason of an old grudge which was between the Jews and the Gentiles, so that he could by no means have entered his speech better, For he pronounceth that those are now clean who were before unclean, so that they have mutual fellowship now with the saints. Furthermore, whereas he said that it was wickedness for the Jews to go in unto the Gentiles, we must know that this came not so much from the law, as from the observation of the fathers. God had forbidden, indeed, that they should (not) entangle themselves with marriages or covenants, (<span class="bvs">Deu_7:3</span>;) they were never forbidden to eat with them, or to use the common businesses of life. But lest that familiarity might entice them into that which was forbidden, they observed the custom delivered by the fathers, so that they did not company together. It is to no end to dispute here whether that tradition did bind men’s consciences; for Peter doth not teach <span class="cite-ref">(683)</span> what is lawful according to God, but what was commonly used. </p><p><em>No man. </em>He maketh the sum and end of the vision more plain, when he referreth that unto men which was spoken of meats. And whereas he saith, that no man is unclean, it may not be understood of (all) particular persons; for it is certain that all unbelievers are polluted with uncleanness of conscience, so that they pollute those things which are otherwise pure, when as they do but touch them. Paul also saith that their children remain unclean until they be cleansed by faith. Finally, if faith alone do purge and purify the hearts of men, unbelief doth make the same profane. But Peter <span class="cite-ref">(684)</span> compareth the Jews and the Gentiles together in this place; and because the wall of separation was pulled down, and the covenant of life <span class="cite-ref">(685)</span> is now common to them both alike, he saith that those are not to be counted aliens who are made partakers of God’s adoption. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(681)</span> “Exasperet,” exasperate. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(682)</span> “Quasi legis contemptor,” as if he had been a despiser of the law, omitted. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(683)</span> “Ex professo,” professedly, omitted. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(684)</span> “Tantum,” only, omitted. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(685)</span> “Et salutis,” and salvation, omitted. </p></div></div>
