<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>I came out from the Father. </em>This mode of expression draws our attention to the Divine power which is in Christ. Our faith in him would not be steady, if it did not perceive his Divine power; for his death and resurrection, the two pillars of faith, would be of little avail to us, if heavenly power were not connected with them. We now understand in what manner we ought to <em>love </em>Christ. Our <em>love </em>ought to be of such a nature that our faith shall contemplate the purpose and power of God, by whose hand he is offered to us. for we must not receive coldly the statement that <em>he came out from God</em>, but must also understand for what reason and for what purpose <em>he came out</em>, namely, that he might be </p><p>to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_1:30</span>.) </p><p><em>Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. </em>By this second clause he points out to us that this power is perpetual- for the disciples might have thought that it was a temporary blessing, that he was sent into the world to be a Redeemer. He therefore said that <em>he returns to the Father</em>, that they may be fully persuaded that none of those blessings which he brought are lost by his departure, because from his heavenly glory he sheds on the world the power and efficacy of his death and resurrection. He therefore <em>left the world </em>when, laying aside our weaknesses, he was received into heaven; but his grace toward us is still in all its force, because he is seated at the right hand of the Father, that he may sway the scepter of the whole world. <span class="cite-ref">(106)</span></p><p><strong>(106)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A fin d’estre Empereur et Dominateur de tout le monde</span>;” — “in order to be the Emperor and Ruler of the whole world.” </p></div>
