<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah goes still farther, even that the Jews had been led to Babylon, on the condition of rendering willing obedience to the authority of King Nebuchadnezzar, and of testifying this by their prayers. He not only bids them patiently to endure the punishment laid on them, but also to be faithful subjects of their conqueror; he not only forbids them to be seditious, but he would have them to obey from the heart, so that God might be a witness of their willing subjection and obedience. </p><p>He says, <em>Seek the peace of the city; </em>this may be understood of prayers; for <span class="lang he-il">דרש</span><em>, daresh, </em>often means to pray: but it may suitably be taken here, as I think, in reference to the conduct of the people, as though he had said, that the Jews were to do what they could, to exert themselves to the utmost, so that no harm might happen to the Chaldean monarchy; for they are afterwards directed to <em>pray </em>It may indeed be, that the same thing is repeated in other words; but if any one weighs the subject more fully, he will, I think, assent to what I have stated, that in the first clause the Prophet bids them to be faithful to King Nebuchadnezzar and to his monarchy. <em>Seek, </em>then<em>, the peace of the city: </em><span class="cite-ref">(208)</span> by peace, as it is well known, is to be understood prosperity. </p><p>But he was not satisfied with external efforts, but he would have them to <em>pray </em>to God, that all things might turn out prosperously and happily to the Babylonian king, even to the end of their exile; for we must bear in mind that the Prophet had ever that time in view. We hence learn that he exhorted the exiles to bear the yoke of the king of Babylon, during the time allotted to the captivity, for to attempt anything rashly was to fight against God, and that he thus far commanded them quietly to bear that tyrannical government. </p><p>He repeats again what he had said, (though I had passed it by,) that they had been <em>carried away captives: </em>for he had spoken of it, “all the captivity which,” he says, “I made to migrate,” or removed, or led captive, “from Jerusalem.” Now, again, he repeats the same thing, that he had <em>carried them away captives, </em><span class="lang he-il">אשו הגליתי</span><em>, asher egeliti; </em><span class="cite-ref">(209)</span> and he said this, that they might not regard only the avarice, or the ambition, or the pride of King Nebuchadnezzar, but that they might raise up their eyes to heaven, and acknowledge Nebuchadnezzar as the scourge of God, and their exile as a chastisement for their sins. God thus testified that he was the author of their exile, that the Jews might not think that they had to do with a mortal man, but on the contrary, understand that they were kicking against the goad, if they murmured and complained, because they lived under the tyranny of a foreign king. That they might not then be agitated with vain thoughts, God comes forth and says, that the exile was imposed on them by his just judgment, in order that they might know that they would gain nothing by their perverseness, and that they might not be disturbed by an anxious disquietude, nor dare to attempt anything new, for this would be to resist God, and as it were to carry on war with heaven. I will finish here. </p><p><strong>(208)</strong> To, “seek the peace of the city” was, no doubt, to promote it by their efforts, to be careful in preserving it. To “seek the land,” in <span class="bvs">Deu_11:12</span>, was to care for it; “not to seek the day,” in <span class="bvs">Job_3:4</span>, was not to regard it. Hence, to “seek the peace of the city,” was to care for, or regard it, so as to do everything to promote it. It is said of Mordecai that he was “seeking the wealth (rather, the good) of his people.” (<span class="bvs">Est_10:3</span>) His whole conduct was a proof of this. To “seek one’s hurt,” as in <span class="bvs">Psa_38:12</span>, was not to pray for it, but to use all means to effect it. Therefore the first sense given by Calvin is the right one. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(209)</strong> It is literally, “whom I have removed,” or transplanted; “moved from home,” is the Sept.; “transferred,” the Vulg.; “made to migrate,” the Targ. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
