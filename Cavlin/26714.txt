<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Henceforth I will not call you servants. </em>By another argument he shows his love toward the disciples, which was, that he opened his mind fully to them, as familiar communication is maintained among <em>friends. </em>“I have condescended,” he says, “far more to you than a mortal man is wont to condescend to his <em>servants </em>Let this be regarded by you, therefore, as a pledge of my love toward you, that I have, in a kind and friendly manner, explained to you the secrets of heavenly wisdom which I had heard from the Father.” It is indeed a noble commendation of the Gospel, that we have the heart of Christ opened (so to speak) in it, so that we can no longer doubt of it or perceive it slightly. We have no reason for desiring to rise above the clouds, or to penetrate into the deep, (<span class="bvs">Rom_10:6</span>) to obtain the certainty of our salvation. Let us be satisfied with this testimony of his love toward us which is contained in the Gospel, for it will never deceive us. Moses said to the ancient people, </p><p>What nation under heaven is so highly favored as to have God near to them, as God talked, with you this day? <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Deu_4:7</span>.) </p><p>But far higher is the distinction which God hath conferred on us, since God hath entirely conveyed himself to us in his Son. So much the greater is the ingratitude and wickedness of those who, not satisfied with the admirable wisdom of the Gospel, fly with proud eagerness to new speculations. </p><p><em>All that I have heard from my Father. </em>It is certain that the disciples did not know all that Christ knew, and indeed it was impossible that they should attain to so great a height; and because the wisdom of God is incomprehensible, he distributed to each of them a certain measure of knowledge, according as he judged to be necessary. Why then does he say that he revealed <em>all things </em>? I answer, this is limited to the person and office of the Mediator. He places himself between God and us, having received out of the secret sanctuary of God those things which he should deliver to us — as the phrase is — from hand to hand. Not one of those things, therefore, which related to our salvation, and which it was of importance for us to know was omitted by Christ in the instructions given to his disciples. Thus, so far as he was appointed to be the Master and Teacher of the Church, he heard nothing from the Father which he did not faithfully teach his disciples. Let us only have an humble desire and readiness to learn, and we shall feel that Paul has justly called the Gospel <em>wisdom to make men perfect</em>, (<span class="bvs">Col_1:28</span>.) </p></div>
