<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Judge not according to the appearance. </em>Having concluded his defense, he likewise administers a reproof on this ground, that they are carried away by wicked dispositions, and do not form <em>a judgment </em>according to the fact and the matter in hand. <em>Circumcision </em>was properly held by them in reverence; and when it was performed on the Sabbath-day, they knew that the Law was not violated by it, because <em>the works of God </em>agree well with each other. Why do they not arrive at the same conclusion as to the <em>work </em>of Christ, but because their minds are preoccupied by a prejudice which they have formed against his person? <em>Judgment, </em>therefore, will never be <em>right, </em>unless it be regulated by the truth of the fact; for as soon as persons appear in public, they turn their eyes and senses on them, so that the truth immediately vanishes. While this admonition ought to be observed in all causes and affairs, it is peculiarly necessary when the question relates to the heavenly doctrine; for there is nothing to which we are more prone than to dislike that doctrine on account of the hatred or contempt of men. </p></div>
