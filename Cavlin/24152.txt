<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>What then shall I do with Jesus? </em>Perceiving that they are so blinded by madness, that they do not hesitate, to their own great dishonor, to rescue <em>a robber </em>from death, Pilate resorts to another expedient for touching them to the quick, and bringing them to a sound mind. He argues that the death of Christ would bring disgrace on themselves, because it had been commonly reported of Jesus, that he was the King and the Christ. As if he had said, “If you have no compassion for the man, pay some regard, at least, to your own honor; for it will be generally thought by foreigners, that he was put to death for a chastisement to you all.” <span class="cite-ref">(261)</span> Yet even this did not abate the fierceness of their cruelty, or hinder them from proceeding to manifest a greater degree of opposition to the public interests than of private hostility to Christ. Thus, according to Mark, Pilate, in order to wound them still more deeply, says that even themselves call Jesus <em>the King; </em>meaning, that this title was constantly used, as if it had been his ordinary surname. Yet, throwing aside all shame, they obstinately insist on the murder of Christ, which brought along with it the disgrace of the whole nation. The Evangelist John (<span class="bvs">Joh_14:15</span>) states a reply, which the other three Evangelists do not mention; namely, that <em>they had no king but Caesar. </em>Thus they choose rather to be deprived of the hope of the promised redemption, and to be devoted to perpetual slavery, than to receive the Redeemer, whom God had offered to them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(261)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour vous chastier, et vous faire despit à tous</span>;” — “to chastise you, and pour contempt on you all.” </p></div></div>
