<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Knowing this first. </em>The participle <em>knowing </em>may be applied to the Apostle, and in this way, “I labor to stir you up for this reason, because I know what and how great is your impending danger from scoffers.” I however prefer this explanation, that the participle is used in place of a verb, as though he had said, “Know ye this especially.” For it was necessary that this should have been foretold, because they might have been shaken, had impious men attacked them suddenly with scoffs of this kind. He therefore wished them to know this, and to feel assured on the subject, that they might be prepared to oppose such men. </p><p>But he calls the attention of the faithful again to the doctrine which he touched upon in the second chapter. For by <em>the last days </em>is commonly meant the kingdom of Christ, or the days of his kingdom, according to what Paul says, “Upon whom the ends of the world are come.” (<span class="bvs">1Co_10:11</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(177)</span> The meaning is, that the more God offers himself by the gospel to the world, and the more he invites men to his kingdom, the more audacious on the other hand will ungodly men vomit forth the poison of their impiety. </p><p>He calls those <em>scoffers, </em>according to what is usual in Scripture, who seek to appear witty by shewing contempt to God, and by a blasphemous presumption. It is, moreover, the very extremity of evil, when men allow themselves to treat the awful name of God with scoffs. Thus, <span class="bvs">Psa_1:1</span> speaks of the seat of scoffers. So David, in <span class="bvs">Psa_119:51</span>, complains that he was derided by the proud, because he attended to God’s law. So Isaiah, in <span class="bvs">Isa_28:14</span>, having referred to them, describes their supine security and insensibility. Let us therefore bear in mind, that there is nothing to be feared more than a contest with scoffers. On this subject we said something while explaining the third chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians. As, however, the Holy Scripture has foretold that they would come, and has also given us a shield by which we may defend ourselves, there is no excuse why we should not boldly resist them whatever devices they may employ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(177)</span> It is literally, “the last of the days,” according to the Hebrew form <span class="lang he-il">אחרית הימים</span>, “the extremity of the days,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_2:2</span>;) but the meaning is the same as “the last days,” as used in <span class="bvs">Heb_1:2</span>, and in other places, that is, the days of the gospel dispensation. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
