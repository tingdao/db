<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>For the enemy hath persecuted my soul</em>. Having acknowledged that he only suffered the just punishment of his sins, David comes now to speak of his enemies; for to have begun by speaking of them would have been a preposterous order. Their cruelty was shown in their not resting satisfied but with the destruction of one who was a saint of God; he declares that he must even now perish unless God should help him speedily. The comparison is not merely to a dead man, but a putrid corpse; for by <em>the dead of an age </em><span class="cite-ref">(250)</span> are meant those who have been long removed from the world. Such language intimates that he not only trusted in God as he who could heal him of a deadly disease, but considered that though his life should be buried, as it were, and long out of mind, God could raise it again, and restore his very ashes. </p><p><strong>(250)</strong><span class="lang he-il">כמתי עולם</span>. These words are differently rendered in the ancient versions. The Septuagint has <span class="lang el-gr">ὡς νεκροὺς αἰωνος</span>, <em>as the dead of the age</em>; the Syriac, <em>forever</em>; the Chaldee, <em>as they that lie down of that age</em>. The real sense of the expression is, <em>as they who have been dead a long time</em>. The Psalmist employs hyperbolical language in this verse; he says, the enemy hath beaten his life to the ground, hath made him dwell in dark places, and for such a length of time, that there remained no remembrance of him, and that he had become like those persons who had long since been in their graves. The design of all this is to express emphatically great sorrow and oppression.” — Phillips. </p></div>
