<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice. </em>Here, also, <span class="cite-ref">(907)</span> the number <em>three </em>is employed to denote frequent repetition. <span class="cite-ref">(908)</span> He means, however, to intimate, that this annoyance had been felt by him distressing, inasmuch as he had so frequently prayed to be exempted from it. For if it had been slight, or <em>easy </em>to be endured, he would not have been so desirous to be freed from it; and yet he says that he had not obtained this: hence it appears, how much need he had of being humbled. He confirms, therefore, what he had said previously — that he had, by means of this bridle, been held back from being haughty; for if relief from it had been for his advantage, he would never have met with a refusal. </p><p>It may seem, however, to follow from this, that Paul had not by any means prayed in faith, if we would not make void all the promises of God. <span class="cite-ref">(909)</span> “We read everywhere in Scripture, that we shall obtain whatever we ask in faith: Paul prays, and does not obtain.” I answer, that as there are different ways of asking, so there are different ways of obtaining. We ask in simple terms those things as to which we have an express promise — as, for example, the perfecting of God’s kingdom, and the <em>hallowing of his name, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_6:9</span>,) the remission of our sins, and every thing that is advantageous to us; but, when we think that the kingdom of God <em>can, </em>nay <em>must </em>be advanced, in this particular manner, or in that, and that this thing, or that, is necessary for the <em>hallowing of his name, </em>we are often mistaken in our opinion. In like manner, we often fall into a serious mistake as to what tends to promote our own welfare. <em>Hence </em>we ask those former things confidently, and without any reservation, while it does not belong to us to prescribe the means. If, however, we specify the means, there is always a condition implied, though not expressed. Now Paul was not so ignorant as not to know this. Hence, as to the <em>object </em>of his prayer, there can be no doubt that he was heard, although he met with a refusal as to the express <em>form. </em>By this we are admonished not to give way to despondency, as if our prayers had been lost labor, when God does not gratify or comply with our wishes, but that we must be <em>satisfied with his grace, </em>that is, in respect of our not being forsaken by him. For the reason, why he sometimes mercifully refuses to his own people, what, in his wrath, he grants to the wicked, is this — that he foresees better what is expedient for us, than our understanding is able to apprehend. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(907)</span> Calvin alludes to what he had said as to the number <em>three, </em>when commenting on an expression, which occurs in <span class="bvs">2Co_12:2</span> — <em>third heavens</em>.
