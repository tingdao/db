<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>For we are made partakers, etc. </em>He commends them for having begun well; but lest, under the pretext of the grace which they had obtained, they should indulge themselves in carnal security, he says that there was need of perseverance; for many having only tasted the Gospel, do not think of any progress as though they had reached the summit. Thus it is that they not only stop in the middle of their race, yea, nigh the starting­posts, but turn another way. Plausible indeed is this objection, “What can we wish more after having found Christ?” But if he is possessed by faith, we must persevere in it, so that he may be our perpetual possession. Christ then has given himself to be enjoyed by us on this condition, that by the same faith by which we have been admitted into a participation of him, we are to preserve so great a blessing even to death. <span class="cite-ref">(64)</span></p><p>Hence he says <em>beginning, </em>intimating that their faith was only begun. As <em>hypostasis </em>sometimes means <em>confidence, </em>it may be so taken here; yet the term <em>substance, </em>as some have rendered it, I do not dislike, though I explain it in a way somewhat different. They think that faith is thus called, because the whole of what man may have without it is nothing but vanity; but I so regard it, because we recumb on it alone, as there is no other support on which we can rely. And suitable to this view is the word <em>steadfast </em>or firm; for we shall be firmly fixed and beyond the danger of vacillating, provided faith be our foundation. The sum of the whole then is, that faith whose beginnings only appear in us, is to make constant and steady progress to the end. <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(64)</span> What is implied here is that we may professedly be partakers of Christ: that is of his blessings as a Savior, and yet be not really so: the proof of the reality is perseverance. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(65)</span> Here is another instance of the genitive being the main subject, “the beginning of our confidence,” i.e., our first confidence, which the Apostle calls “first faith” in <span class="bvs">1Ti_5:12</span>.
