<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>55.</strong><em>For my flesh is truly food. </em>He confirms the same statement by other words, “As the body is weakened and consumed by the want of food, so the soul, if it be not fed with heavenly bread, will soon perish with hunger.” For when he declares that<em>his flesh is truly food, </em>he means that souls are famished, if they want that food. Then only wilt thou find life in Christ, when thou shalt seek the nourishment of life in his flesh. Thus we ought to boast, with Paul, that we reckon nothing to be excellent but Christ crucified; because, as soon as we have departed from the sacrifice of his death, we meet with nothing but death; nor is there any other road that conducts us to a perception of his Divine power than through his death and resurrection. Embrace Christ, therefore, as <em>the Servant of the Father</em>, (<span class="bvs">Isa_42:1</span>,) that he may show himself to thee to be <em>the Prince of life</em>, (<span class="bvs">Act_3:15</span>.) For when <em>he emptied himself</em>, (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>,) in this manner we were enriched with abundance of all blessings; his humiliation and descent into hell raised us to heaven; and, by enduring the curse of his cross, he erected the banner of our righteousness as a splendid memorial of his victory. <span class="cite-ref">(165)</span> Consequently, they are false expounders of the mystery of the Lord’s Supper, <span class="cite-ref">(166)</span> who draw away souls from the flesh of Christ. </p><p><em>And my blood is truly drink. </em>But why does Christ mention <em>his blood </em>separately, when it is included in the word<em>flesh </em>? I reply, he did so in condescension to our weakness. For when he expressly mentions<em>food and drink, </em>he declares that the life which he bestows is complete in every respect, that we may not imagine to ourselves a life which is only half or imperfect; as if he had said, that we shall want nothing that belongs to life, provided that we <em>eat his flesh and drink his blood. </em>Thus also in the Lord’s Supper, which corresponds to this doctrine, not satisfied with the symbol of <em>the bread</em>, he adds also <em>the cup</em>, that, having in him a twofold pledge, we may learn to be satisfied with him alone; for never will a man find a part of life in Christ, until he has entire and complete life in him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(165)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il a dresse l’enseigne de nostre justice comme un memorial magnifique de sa victoire</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(166)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceux-la donc ne sont pas bons et droicts expositeurs du mystere de la Cene</span>.” </p></div></div>
