<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>That my glory may sing praise to thee. </em>In this verse he more fully expresses his acknowledgement of the purpose for which God had preserved him from death, and that he would be careful to render him a proper return of gratitude. Some refer the word <em>glory </em>to the body, and some to the soul, or the higher powers of the mind. Others, as the pronoun <em>my, </em>which we have supplied, is not in the Hebrew text, prefer to translate it in the accusative case, supplying the word <em>every man, </em>in this way: <em>That every man may celebrate thy glory; </em>as if the prophet had said, This is a blessing worthy of being celebrated by the public praises of all men. But as all these interpretations are strained, I adhere to the sense which I have given. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">כבוד</span>, <em>kebod, </em>which signifies <em>glory, </em>it is well known, is sometimes employed metaphorically to signify <em>the tongue, </em>as we have seen in <span class="bvs">Psa_16:9</span>. And as David adds immediately after, <em>I will celebrate thy praise for ever, </em>the context demands that he should particularly speak of his own duty in this place. His meaning, therefore, is, O Lord, as I know that thou hast preserved me for this purpose, that thy praises may resound from my tongue, I will faithfully discharge this service to thee, and perform my part even unto death. <em>To sing, and not be silent, </em>is a Hebrew <em>amplification; </em>as if he had said, My tongue shall not be mute, or deprive God of his due praise; it shall, on the contrary, devote itself to the celebration of his glory. </p></div>
