<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>In sacrifice and oblation thou hast not taken pleasure. </em>Here David offers not only the sacrifice of praise, or, as the prophet Hosea calls it, (<span class="bvs">Hos_14:2</span>,) “the calves of the lips,” but, in token of his gratitude, offers and consecrates himself entirely to God; as if he had said, I am now wholly devoted to God, because, having been delivered by his wonderful power, I am doubly indebted to him for my life. At the same time, treating of the true worship of God, he shows that it consists not in outward ceremonies, but rather that it is spiritual. Accordingly, the meaning is, that he came into the presence of God not only in the outward pomp or ceremony and figures of the law, but that he brought with him the true devotion of the heart. We know, indeed, that all men have some sense of religion impressed upon their hearts, so that no one dares to withdraw openly and wholly from his service, and yet the greater part of men turn aside into winding and crooked paths; and hence it happens, that in serving God in a perfunctory manner, their worship is scarcely anything else than a mockery of him. We see then the reason why David, on the present occasion, shows in what the true worship of God consists; it is, that he may distinguish between himself and hypocrites, who draw near to God with their lips only, or at least seek to pacify him with cold and unmeaning ceremonies. </p><p>We now come to the exposition of the words. I have no doubt that David, under the four different kinds of sacrifices which he here enumerates, comprehends all the sacrifices of the law. His meaning, to express it in a few words, is, that God requires not mere ceremonies of those who serve him, but that he is satisfied only with sincerity of heart, with faith and holiness of life: and that he takes no pleasure merely in the visible sanctuary, the altar, the burning of incense, the killing of beasts, the lights, the costly apparel, and outward washings. From this he concludes, that he ought to be guided by another principle, and to observe another rule in the service of God, than a mere attention to these — that he should yield himself wholly to God. </p><p><em>Thou hast bored my ears. </em>Some think that in using this form of expression, David has a reference to the ordinance under the Law of which we read in <span class="bvs">Exo_21:6</span>. If any bond-servant, when the time of his being discharged from servitude had arrived, made no account of his freedom, he was brought to the public place of judgment, and having there declared that he wished to continue in servitude, his master pierced his ear with an awl, as a mark of perpetual bondage. But this mode of interpretation appears to be too forced and refined. <span class="cite-ref">(88)</span> Others more simply consider that it is of the same meaning as to render fit, or qualify for service, for David mentions not one ear only, but both. Men, we know, are naturally deaf, because they are so dull, that their ears are stopped until God pierce them. By this expression, therefore, is denoted the docility to which we are brought and moulded by the grace of the Holy Spirit. I, however, apply this manner of expression more closely to the scope of the passage before us, and explain it in this sense, That David was not slow and dull of hearing, as men usually are, so that he could discern nothing but what was earthly in the sacrifices, but that his ears had been cleansed, so that he was a better interpreter of the Law, and able to refer all the outward ceremonies to the spiritual service of God. He encloses the sentence, <em>Thou hast bored my ears, </em>as it were, in parenthesis, whilst he is treating professedly of sacrifices, so that the sentence might be explained in this way: Lord, thou hast opened my ears, that I may distinctly understand whatever thou hast commanded concerning the sacrifices, namely, that of themselves they afford thee no pleasure: for thou, who art a Spirit, takest no delight in these earthly elements, and hast no need of flesh or blood; and, therefore, thou requirest something of a higher and more excellent nature. If, however, it is objected that sacrifices were offered by the express commandment of God, I have just said that David here distinguishes between the spiritual service of God, and that which consisted in outward types and shadows. And in making this comparison, it is no great wonder to find him saying that the sacrifices are of no value, since they were only helps designed to lead men to true piety, and tended to a far higher end than that which was at first apparent. Seeing, then, God made use of these elements, only to lead his people to the exercises of faith and repentance, we conclude that he had no delight in being worshipped by sacrifices. We must always bear in mind, that whatever is not pleasing to God for its own sake, but only in so far as it leads to some other end, if it be put in the place of his true worship and service is rejected and cast away by him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(88)</span> The objections to this interpretation are, </p><p><span class="cite-note">1.</span>That the verb <span class="lang he-il">כרה</span><em>carah</em>, here used, does not mean <em>to bore</em>, but that the radical idea of the word is, <em>to dig</em>, <em>to hollow out</em>; as to dig a well, <span class="bvs">Gen_26:25</span>; a pit, <span class="bvs">Psa_7:15</span>; to carve or cut out a sepulcher from a rock, <span class="bvs">2Ch_16:14</span>; and hence we find it transferred from the grottoes of the sepulcher to the quarry of human nature, <span class="bvs">Isa_51:1</span>. Williams, viewing the verb as properly signifying <em>digged</em>, <em>carved</em>, or <em>cut out</em>, in the sense <em>of forming</em>, explains the words as if the Psalmist had said, “Mine ears hast thou made, or <em>prepared</em>, for the most exact and complete obedience.” Stuart, (Commentary on <span class="bvs">Heb_10:5</span>,) and Davidson, (Sacred Hermeneutics, p. 461,) viewing the word as meaning <em>digged</em>, <em>hollowed out</em>, simply in the sense of <em>opening</em>, read, “Mine ears hast thou opened;” which they explain as meaning, Thou hast made me obedient, or, I am entirely devoted to thy service; observing, that <em>to open </em>or <em>uncover the ear </em>was a customary expression among the Hebrews, to signify a revealing something to any one, including the idea of listening to the communication, followed by prompt obedience, <span class="bvs">Isa_50:5</span>; <span class="bvs">1Sa_20:2</span>. There is another verb of the same radical letters, which means to <em>purchase </em>or <em>provide</em>; and this is the sense in which the LXX. understood <span class="lang he-il">כרה</span>, <em>carah</em>, as is evident from their rendering it by <span class="lang el-gr">κατηρτίσω</span></p><p><span class="cite-note">2.</span>That the verb used in Exodus is not <span class="lang he-il">כרה</span>, as here, but <span class="lang he-il">רצע</span>,<em>ratsang </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">3.</span>That only one ear was pierced, as appears from the passages in the Pentateuch in which the rite is described. But here the plural number is used, denoting both ears. From these considerations, it is concluded that there is here no allusion to the custom of boring the ear of a servant under the Law. </p></div></div>
