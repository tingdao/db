<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And when thou sendest him out free from thee</em>. Here not only is the <em>enfranchisement </em>of slaves enjoined, but an exhortation to liberality is also added, viz., that they should not send away their slaves without their hire; for this is not a civil enactment for the purpose of extorting from the avaricious more than they were willing to give. The rule of Paul here applies: </p><p>“Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, <em>so let him give</em>; not grudgingly or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.” (<span class="bvs">2Co_9:7</span>.) </p><p>But, since the Hebrew slaves were brethren, God would not allow them to be placed in a worse condition than hirelings. That He commands them to be furnished out of the wine-press, and floor, and flock, does not mean that they were to be enriched, or that a large provision should be assigned to them, but He justly lays a constraint on the rich, whose varied abundance supplied them with the means of liberality; as if He would show them from whence they received their gratuitous gifts, which were at the same time a just compensation for the labors of their slaves. </p></div>
