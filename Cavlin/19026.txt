<div class="comment-content"><p>And in the same sense is to be taken what follows, <em>Surely, deceit is from the hills, and the multitude of mountains, </em>or, from the multitude of mountains, as the letter <span class="lang he-il">מ</span> is to be repeated. Here the Prophet more fully expresses the evidence of their repentance, as though he had said, “We have been deceived by the hills and the multitude of mountains; we thought that there would be more defense from a large number of gods than if we worshipped one God: this deception has led to ruin. Let then all these deceits be now discarded; for we shall be content with the only true God.” In short, the Israelites confess, in these words, that they had been drawn into ruin by the worst of errors, while they sought many gods, and did not acquiesce in the one true God. </p><p>Then they add, <em>for surely in Jehovah our God is salvation </em>They set here the one true God in opposition to all their idols, as though they had said, that the cause of all their evils was, that they did not continue in the service of the one true God, but wandered after a multitude of Gods. We hence see that these two things cannot possibly be connected, — to worship the true God, — and to seek for ourselves various other gods, and to form vain hopes, as they do, who are not satisfied with the only true God. <span class="cite-ref">(95)</span> It follows — </p><p><strong>(95)</strong> The literal rendering of these two verses is the following:- </p><p><strong>22.</strong>Return, ye apostate children, I will heal your apostasies. — Behold us! We come to thee; For thou art Jehovah our God: </p><p><strong>23.</strong>Surely, in vain are the hills, The multitude of mountains; Surely, in (or through) Jehovah our God Is the salvation of Israel. </p><p>The word rendered “apostate,” does not mean “rebellious,” but such as turn away, <em>i.e.</em>, from God; and the word for “apostasies” means the same, being from the same root. The <span class="lang he-il">מ</span> before the word for “hills,” is not a preposition, as it is commonly taken, but a formative: so it appears from all the versions. <em>Blayney </em>conjectures that it belongs to the former word, and makes it <span class="lang he-il">לשקרים</span>; but then he does not account for the <span class="lang he-il">ל</span> prefixed to it. There is no different reading. The <em>Septuagint </em>is, <span class="lang el-gr">εἰς ψεῦδος ἧσαν οἱ ζουνοὶ</span> — for a lie were the hills. The <em>Vulgate, Syriac, </em>and <em>Arabic, </em>are materially the same. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
