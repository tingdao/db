<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21</strong><em>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again </em>Those are mistaken who suppose that the wicked are here blamed for their treachery in carrying off the goods of others by fraud and deception; and that, on the other hand, the children of God are commended for their kindness in being always ready to relieve the wants of their poorer brethren. The prophet rather extols, on the one hand, the blessing of God towards the godly; and declares, on the other, that the ungodly never have enough. The meaning therefore is, that God deals bountifully with his own people, that they may be able to aid others; but that the ungodly are always in want, so that their poverty leads them to have recourse to fraud and rapine. And were we not blinded by insensibility and indifference, we could not fail to perceive the many proofs of this which are daily presented to our view. However great the abundance of the ungodly, yet their covetousness is so insatiable, that, like robbers, they plunder right and left, and yet are never able to pay; <span class="cite-ref">(38)</span> while God bestows upon his own people a sufficiency not only for the supply of their own ordinary wants, but also to enable them to aid others. I do not indeed deny, that the wicked are reproved for wasteful extravagance, by which they defraud their creditors of what is their due, and also that the righteous are praised for applying to a proper use the bounty of God; but the design of the prophet is to show the high value of the divine blessing. This is confirmed by the following verse, in which he illustrates the difference resulting from the blessing and the curse of God. It then it is asked, whence the children of God are able to relieve the wants of the needy, and to exercise liberality towards them? and why it is that the ungodly are continually contracting debts from which they are never able to extricate themselves? David answers, that the former are blessed of the Lord, and that the latter are brought to utter ruin by his curse. Some expound the word <span class="lang he-il">מברכיו</span>, <em>meborakayv, </em>actively, as if it were, <em>Those who bless the righteous shall possess, </em>etc.; <span class="cite-ref">(39)</span> but this is constrained and absurd. The meaning is simply this, that whatever we need for the preservation and maintenance of life, and for the exercise of humanity towards others, comes to us neither from the heavens nor from the earth, but only from the favor and blessing of God; and that if he once withdraw his grace, the abundance of the whole world would not satisfy us. </p><p><strong>(38)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme escumeurs de mer sans jamais avoir de quoy satisfaire</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “Like pirates, without ever having any thing to pay.” </p><p><strong>(39)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme s’il y avoit, Ceux qui beniront les justes, possederont</span>,” etc. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
