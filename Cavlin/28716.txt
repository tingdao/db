<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>But if any man be ignorant </em>The old translation reads thus: <em>He that knows not this, will be unknown; </em><span class="cite-ref">(889)</span> but this is a mistake. For Paul had it in view to cut off every handle from contentious persons, who make no end of disputing, and that, under the pretense of inquiring — as if the matter were not yet clear; or at least he intimates in general terms, that he regarded as of no account any one that would call in question what he said. “If any one is ignorant, I do not stop to take notice of his doubts, for the certainty of my doctrine is not at all impaired thereby. Let him go then, whoever he may be. As for you, do not the less on that account give credit to Christ, as speaking by me.” In fine, he intimates, that sceptics, contentious persons, and subtle disputants; <span class="cite-ref">(890)</span> do not by the questions they raise diminish, in any degree, the authority of sound doctrine, and of that truth as to which believers ought to feel assured, and at the same time he admonishes us, not to allow their doubts to be any hindrance in our way. That elevation of mind, however, which despises all human judgments, ought to be founded on ascertained truth. Hence, as it would be the part of perverse rashness, either to maintain pertinaciously, in opposition to the views of all others, an opinion that has once been taken up, or audaciously to cling to it, while others are in doubt, so, on the other hand, when we have felt assured that it is God that speaks, let us fearlessly break through all human impediments and all difficulties. <span class="cite-ref">(891)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(889)</span><em>Beausobre</em>, when adverting to this reading, says: “<span class="lang fr-fr">La Vulgate porte, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">il sera ignore</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, Dieu k </span><em class="lang fr-fr">meconnoitra</em><span class="lang fr-fr">; ce qui vent dire, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">le punira </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Ce sens est fort bon</span>;” — “The Vulgate renders it: <em>he will be unknown </em>— <em>God will disown him </em>— meaning to say: <em>He will punish him </em>This is a very good meaning.” In <em>one </em>Greek MS. the reading is <span class="lang el-gr">ἀγνοεῖται</span>, — <em>is unknown </em>Wiclif, (1380) renders it — <em>And if ony man unknowith</em>: <em>he schal be unknown </em>The view taken by Calvin, however, is the more generally approved, and seems to accord better with the general strain of the passage. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(890)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les sophistes qui ne font iamais que disputer, sans rien resoudre ou accorder, ne les contentieux, et subtils iaseurs</span>;” — “Sophists who are never but disputing, without coming to any solution or agreement, nor contentious persons, and subtile prattlers.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(891)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sans nous en soucier aucunement</span>;” — “Without giving ourselves any concern as to them.” </p></div></div>
