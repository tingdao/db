<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>If then I, who am your Lord and Master. </em>This is an argument from the greater to the less. Pride hinders us from maintaining that equality which ought to exist amongst us. But Christ, who is far exalted above all others, stoops down, that he may make the proud men ashamed, who, forgetting their station and rank, look upon themselves as not bound to hold intercourse with the brethren. For what does a mortal man imagine himself to be, when he refuses to bear the burdens of brethren, to accommodate himself to their customs, and, in short, to perform those offices by which the unity of the Church is maintained? In short, he means that the man who does not think of associating with weak brethren, on the condition of submitting mildly and gently even to offices which appear to be mean, claims more than he has a right to claim, and has too high an opinion of himself. <span class="cite-ref">(47)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(47)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Cestuy-la s’attribue plus qu’il ne faut, et fait trop grand conte de soy</span>.” </p></div></div>
