<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>But I have greater testimony than that of John. </em>After having showed that, in the person of John, the Jews had wickedly corrupted the gift of God, he now repeats a second time what he had said, that he has no need of the <em>testimony </em>of man, as if he had not enough of himself; although, perceiving that they held his person in contempt, he sent them to his Father, according to his custom. </p><p><em>For the works which the Father hath given me to do. </em>He holds out to view two things, by which he was proved to be the Son of God. “<em>My Father</em>, ” says he, “attests by miracles that I am his Son; and before I came into the world, he gave abundant testimony to me in the sacred writings.” Let us always remember what object he has in view. He wishes to be recognized as the Messiah promised by God, that he may be heard, and, therefore, he maintains that he is now manifested to be such a person as Scripture describes him. It may be asked, Are miracles sufficient to prove this; for similar miracles had been already performed by the Prophets? I reply, those miracles which God performed by the agency of the Prophets did not go beyond the purpose for which they were intended, namely, to show that they were the ministers of God, because they could in no other way obtain the authority due to their office. But God intended to exalt his Son more highly, and this purpose of God ought to be regarded by us as the design of miracles. Therefore, if the Jews had not been prejudiced by malice and voluntarily shut their eyes, Christ might easily have proved to them by his miracles who and what he was. </p></div>
