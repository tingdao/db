<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>And Jesus answering said. </em>Christ might have stated simply, that the word <em>neighbor </em>extends indiscriminately to every man, because the whole human race is united by a sacred bond of fellowship. And, indeed, the Lord employed this word in the Law, for no other reason than to draw us sweetly to mutual kindness. The commandment would have run more clearly thus: <em>Love every man as thyself. </em>But as men are blinded by their pride, so that every man is satisfied with himself, scarcely deigns to admit others to an equal rank, and withholds from them the duties he owes them, the Lord purposely declares that all are <em>neighbors </em>that the very relationship may produce mutual love. To make any person our <em>neighbor, </em>therefore, it is enough that he be, a man; for it is not in our power to blot out our common nature. </p><p>But Christ intended to draw the reply from the Pharisee, that he might condemn himself. For in consequence of the authoritative decision being generally received among them, that no man is our <em>neighbor </em>unless he is our friend, if Christ had put a direct question to him, he would never have made an explicit acknowledgment, that under the word <em>neighbor </em>all men are included, which the comparison brought forward forces him to confess. The general truth conveyed is, that the greatest stranger is <em>our neighbor, </em>because God has bound all men together, for the purpose of assisting each other. He glances briefly, however, at the Jews, and especially at the priests; because, while they boasted of being the children of the same Father, and of being separated by the privilege of adoption from the rest of the nations, so as to be God’s sacred heritage, yet, with barbarous and unfeeling contempt, they despised each other, as if no relationship had subsisted between them. For there is no doubt that Christ describes the cruel neglect of brotherly kindness, with which they knew that they were chargeable. But here, as I have said, the chief design is to show that the <em>neighborhood, </em>which lays us under obligation to mutual offices of kindness, is not confined to friends or relatives, but extends to the whole human race. </p><p>To prove this, Christ compares <em>a Samaritan </em>to <em>a priest </em>and <em>a Levite. </em>It is well known what deadly hatred the Jews bore to the <em>Samaritans, </em>so that, notwithstanding their living close beside them, they were always at the greatest variance. Christ now says, that a Jew, an inhabitant of <em>Jericho, </em>on his journey <em>from Jerusalem, </em>having been wounded by <em>robbers, </em>received no assistance either from <em>a Levite or from a priest, </em>both of whom met with him lying on the road, and <em>half-dead, </em>but that a <em>Samaritan </em>showed him great kindness, and then asks, <em>Which of these three was neighbor </em>to the Jew? This subtle doctor could not escape from preferring the <em>Samaritan </em>to the other two. For here, as in a mirror, we behold that common relationship of men, which the scribes endeavored to blot out by their wicked sophistry; <span class="cite-ref">(77)</span> and the <em>compassion, </em>which an enemy showed to a Jew, demonstrates that the guidance and teaching of nature are sufficient to show that man was created for the sake of man. Hence it is inferred that there is a mutual obligation between all men. </p><p>The allegory which is here contrived by the advocates of free will is too absurd to deserve refutation. According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only <em>half-dead. </em>As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are <em>dead, </em>but those whom he quickens by <em>his voice, </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_5:25</span>.) As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This <em>Samaritan </em>they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that <em>wine was poured, </em>along with <em>oil, </em>into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as <em>an innkeeper, </em>to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning. And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(77)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par ur fausse glose et cavillation meschante</span>;” — “by their false gloss and wicked sophistry.” </p></div></div>
