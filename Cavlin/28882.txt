For mere natural feeling will not lead us forward to this, for it does not comprehend that hundredfold recompense which springs from the <em>dying </em>of a single <em>grain. </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_12:24</span>.) We must, therefore, be <em>fitted </em>for it by God. The manner of it is at the same time subjoined — that he confirms us by his Spirit, who is as it were an <em>earnest </em>At the same time the particle <em>also </em>seems to be added for the sake of amplification. “It is God who forms in us this desire, and, lest our courage should give way or waver, the Holy Spirit is given us as an <em>earnest, </em>because by his testimony he confirms, and ratifies the truth of the promise.” For these are <em>two </em>offices of the Holy Spirit — <em>first, </em>to show to believers what they ought to desire, and <em>secondly, </em>to influence their hearts efficaciously, and remove all their doubt, that they may steadfastly persevere in choosing what is good. There would, however, be nothing unsuitable in extending the word <em>fitted, </em>so as to denote that renovation of life, with which God adorns his people even in this life, for in this way he already separates them from others, and shows that they are, by means of his grace, marked out for a peculiar condition. </p></div>
