<div class="comment-content"><p>In this miracle we are informed in what manner the grace of Christ began to flow to the Gentiles; for, though the full time was not yet come when Christ would make himself known to the whole world, yet he intended to give some early manifestations of the common mercy which was at length offered indiscriminately to Jews and Gentiles after his resurrection. A remarkable picture of faith is presented to us in the woman of Canaan, for the purpose of instructing us by means of comparison, that the Jews were justly deprived of the promised redemption, since their impiety was so shameful. </p><p>The <em>woman, </em>whom Matthew describes as <em>of Canaan, </em>is said by Mark to have been <em>a Greek, </em>and <em>a Syrophenician by birth </em>But there is no contradiction here; for we know that it was the prevailing custom among the Jews to call all foreign nations <em>Greeks, </em>and hence that contrast between <em>Greeks </em>and<em>Jews, </em>which occurs so frequently in the writings of Paul. As she was a native of <em>the territories of Tyre and Sidon, </em>we need not wonder that she is called a <em>Syrophenician; </em>for that country was called <em>Syria, </em>and formed part of <em>Phenicia. </em>The Jews disdainfully gave the name of <em>Canaanites </em>to all the inhabitants of that district; and it is probable that the majority of them were descended from the tribes of <em>Canaan, </em>who when banished from their native country, fled to a sort of retreat in the neighborhood. Both agree in this point, that the woman was a native of a heathen nation, that she had not been instructed in the doctrine of the law, and that she came of her own accord to Christ, humbly to entreat his aid. </p></div>
