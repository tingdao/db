<div class="comment-content"><p>What is added immediately after, (verse 45,) the <em>children of strangers shall fade away; they shall tremble </em><span class="cite-ref">(438)</span><em>from within their places of concealment, </em>serves to place, in a still more striking light, the great fame and formidable name which we have said David had acquired. It is no ordinary sign of reverence when those who are protected in hiding-places, and shut up within steep fortifications, are so stricken with terror as to come forth of their own accord and surrender themselves. As fear made the enemies of David to come forth from their places of concealment, to meet him with submission, so the Gospel strikes the unbelieving with such fear, as compels them to yield obedience to Christ. Such is the power of prophecy, that is to say, the preaching of the word, as Paul testifies in <span class="bvs">1Co_14:24</span>, that, convincing the consciences of men, and making manifest the secrets of their hearts, it causes those who before were rebels to prostrate themselves with fear, and to give glory to God. </p><p><strong>(438)</strong> The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">חרג</span>, <em>charag, </em>signifies both <em>to be moved </em>and <em>to tremble, </em>and combining both ideas, <em>to move fearfully. </em>The last appears to be the view which Calvin attaches to the word. “Fear shall cause them to be afraid, and come forth of their secret holes and holds, to seek pardon.” —<em>Note, Bassandyne’s Bible. </em>Walford reads, </p><p>“The sons of the stranger lose their strength; <LineBreak />Through alarm they quit their strongholds. </p><p><em>Street </em>reads, </p><p>“Foreign nations are confounded, <LineBreak />and they shudder within their fortresses.” </p></div>
