<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>God who commanded light to shine out of darkness. </em>I see that this passage may be explained in four different ways. In the <em>first </em>place thus: “God has <em>commanded light to shine forth out of darkness: </em>that is, by the ministry of men, who are in their own nature <em>darkness, </em>He has brought forward the <em>light </em>of His gospel into the world.” <em>Secondly, </em>thus: “God has made the <em>light </em>of the gospel to take the place of the law, which was wrapt up in <em>dark </em>shadows, and thus, He has brought <em>light </em>out of <em>darkness</em>. ” Those that are fond of subtleties, would be prepared readily to receive expositions of that sort, but any one, who will examine the matter more closely, will perceive, that they do not correspond with the Apostle’s intention. The <em>third </em>exposition is that of Ambrose: “When all things were involved in darkness, God kindled up the light of His gospel. For mankind were sunk in the darkness of ignorance, when God on a sudden shone forth upon them by his gospel.” The <em>fourth </em>is that of Chrysostom, who is of opinion, that Paul alluded to the creation of the world, in this way: “God, who by his word created light, drawing it, as it were, out of the darkness <span class="cite-ref">(454)</span> — that same Being has now enlightened us in a spiritual manner, when we were buried in darkness.” This transition, <span class="cite-ref">(455)</span> from light that is visible and corporeal to what is spiritual, has more of elegance, and there is nothing forced in it. The preceding one, <span class="cite-ref">(456)</span> however, is not unsuitable. Let every one follow his own judgment. </p><p><em>Hath shined in our hearts. </em>He speaks of a twofold illumination, which must be carefully observed — the one is that of the gospel, the other is secret, taking place in our hearts. <span class="cite-ref">(457)</span> For as God, the Creator of the world, pours forth upon us the brightness of the sun, and gives us eyes to receive it, so, as the Redeemer, in the person of his Son, He shines forth, indeed, upon us by His gospel, but, as we are blind, that would be in vain, if He did not at the same time enlighten our understandings by His Spirit. His meaning, therefore, is, that God has, by His Spirit, opened the eyes of our understandings, so as to make them capable of receiving the light of the gospel. </p><p><em>In the face of Jesus Christ. </em>In the same sense in which he had previously said that Christ is the <em>image of the Father, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_4:4</span>) he now says, that the glory of God is manifested to us <em>in his face. </em>Here we have a remarkable passage, from which we learn that God is not to be <em>sought out </em>(<span class="bvs">Job_11:7</span>) in His unsearchable height, </p><p>(for He dwells in light that is inaccessible, <span class="bvs">1Ti_6:16</span>,) </p><p>but is to be known by us, in so far as He manifests himself in Christ. Hence, whatever men desire to know respecting God, apart from Christ, is evanescent, for they wander out of the way. True, indeed, God in Christ appears in the first instance to be mean, but he appears at length to be glorious in the view of those, who hold on, so as to come from the cross to the resurrection. <span class="cite-ref">(458)</span> Again we see, that in the word person <span class="cite-ref">(459)</span> there is a reference made to us, <span class="cite-ref">(460)</span> because it is more advantageous for us to behold God, as He appears in His only-begotten Son, than to search out His secret essence. </p><p><strong>(454)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Du profond des tenebres</span>;” — “Out of the depth of darkness.” </p><p><strong>(455)</strong><em>Anagoge</em>.
