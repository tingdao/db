<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>And the earth was without form and void. </em>I shall not be very solicitous about the exposition of these two epithets, <span class="lang he-il">תוהו</span>, (<em>tohu,</em>) and <span class="lang he-il">בוהו</span>, (<em>bohu.</em>) The Hebrews use them when they designate anything empty and confused, or vain, and nothing worth. Undoubtedly Moses placed them both in opposition to all those created objects which pertain to the form, the ornament and the perfection of the world. Were we now to take away, I say, from the earth all that God added after the time here alluded to, then we should have this rude and unpolished, or rather shapeless chaos. <span class="cite-ref">(44)</span> Therefore I regard what he immediately subjoins that “darkness was upon the face of the abyss,” <span class="cite-ref">(45)</span> as a part of that confused emptiness: because the light began to give some external appearance to the world. For the same reason he calls it the <em>abyss </em>and <em>waters</em>, since in that mass of matter nothing was solid or stable, nothing distinct. </p><p><em>And the Spirit of God </em>Interpreters have wrested this passage in various ways. The opinion of some that it means the wind, is too frigid to require refutation. They who understand by it the Eternal Spirit of God, do rightly; yet all do not attain the meaning of Moses in the connection of his discourse; hence arise the various interpretations of the participle <span class="lang he-il">מרחפת</span>, (<em>merachepeth</em>.) I will, in the first place, state what (in my judgment) Moses intended. We have already heard that before God had perfected the world it was an undigested mass; he now teaches that the power of the Spirit was necessary in order to sustain it. For this doubt might occur to the mind, how such a disorderly heap could stand; seeing that we now behold the world preserved by government, or order. <span class="cite-ref">(46)</span> He therefore asserts that this mass, however confused it might be, was rendered stable, for the time, by the secret efficacy of the Spirit. Now there are two significations of the Hebrew word which suit the present place; either that the spirit moved and agitated itself over the waters, for the sake of putting forth vigor; or that He brooded over them to cherish them. <span class="cite-ref">(47)</span> Inasmuch as it makes little difference in the result, whichever of these explanations is preferred, let the reader’s judgment be left free. But if that chaos required the secret inspiration of God to prevent its speedy dissolution; how could this order, so fair and distinct, subsist by itself, unless it derived strength elsewhere? Therefore, that Scripture must be fulfilled, </p><p>‘Send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and thou shalt renew the face of the earth,’ (<span class="bvs">Psa_104:30</span>;) </p><p>so, on the other hand, as soon as the Lord takes away his Spirit, all things return to their dust and vanish away, (<span class="bvs">Psa_104:29</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(44)</span> The words <span class="lang he-il">תהו ובהו</span> are rendered in Calvin’s text informis et inanis, “shapeless and empty.” They are, however, substantives, and are translated in <span class="bvs">Isa_34:11</span>, “confusion” and “emptiness.” The two words standing in connection, were used by the Hebrews to describe anything that was most dreary, waste, and desolate. The Septuagint has <span class="lang el-gr">κὰι ἀκατασκευάστος</span>, invisible and unfurnished. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(45)</span> It is to be remarked, that Calvin does not in his comment always adhere to his own translation. For instance, his version here is, “in superficiem voraginis;” but in his Commentary he has it, “super faciem abyssi,” from the Latin Vulgate. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(46)</span> “Temperamento servari.” Perhaps we should say, “preserved by the laws of nature.” — Ed. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(47)</span> The participle of the verb <span class="lang he-il">רהף</span> is here used instead of the regular tense. “The Spirit was moving,” instead of “the Spirit moved.” The word occurs in <span class="bvs">Deu_32:11</span>, where the eagle is represented as fluttering over her young. Vatablus, whom Calvin here probably follows, says, the Holy Spirit cherished the earth “by his secret virtue, that it might remain stable for the time.” — See Poole’s Synopsis. The word, however, is supposed further to imply a vivifying power; as that of birds brooding over and hatching their young. Gesenius says that Moses here speaks, “<span class="lang de-de">Von der shaffenden und belebenden Kraft Gottes die uber der chaotischen wasserbedeckten Erde schwebt gleichsam bruetet</span> ” — “of the creative and quickening power of God, which hovered over the chaotic and water — covered earth, as if brooding.” The same view is given by P. Martyr on Genesis; others, however, are opposed to this interpretation. Vide Johannes Clericus in loco. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
