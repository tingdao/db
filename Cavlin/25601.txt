<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_15:12</span><strong>.</strong><em>And the younger of them said to his father. </em>The parable opens by describing a mark of wicked arrogance in the youth, which appears in his being desirous to leave his father, and in thinking that he cannot be right without being permitted to indulge in debauchery, free from his father’s control. There is also ingratitude in leaving the old man, <span class="cite-ref">(524)</span> and not only withholding the performance of the duties which be owed to him, but crippling and diminishing the wealth of his house. <span class="cite-ref">(525)</span> This is at length followed by wasteful luxury and wicked extravagance, by which he squanders all that he had. <span class="cite-ref">(526)</span> After so many offenses he deserved to find his father implacable. <span class="cite-ref">(527)</span></p><p>Under this image our Lord unquestionably depicts to us the boundless goodness and inestimable forbearance of God, that no crimes, however aggravated, may deter us from the hope of obtaining pardon, There would be some foundation for the analogy, if we were to say that this foolish and insolent youth resembles those persons who, enjoying at the hand of God a great abundance of good things, are moved by a blind and mad ambition to be separated from Him, that they may enjoy perfect freedom; as if it were not more desirable than all the kingdoms of the world to live under the fatherly care and government of God. But as I am afraid that this allusion may be thought overstrained, I shall satisfy myself with the literal meaning; not that I disapprove of the opinion, that under this figure is reproved the madness of those who imagine that it will be advantageous for them to have something of their own, and to be rich apart from the heavenly Father; but that I now confine myself within the limits of a Commentator. <span class="cite-ref">(528)</span></p><p>Christ here describes what usually happens with young men, when they are carried away by their natural disposition. Destitute of sound judgment, and maddened by passion, they are ill fitted for governing themselves, and are not restrained by fear or shame. It is therefore impossible but that they shall abandon themselves to every thing to which their sinful inclination prompts them, and rush on in a disgraceful course, till they are involved in shameful poverty. He afterwards describes the punishment which, in the righteous judgment of God, generally overtakes spendthrifts and prodigals. After having wickedly squandered their means, they are left to pine in hunger, and not having known how to use in moderation an abundant supply of the best bread, they are reduced to eat acorns and <em>husks</em>. In short, they become the companions of <em>swine</em>, and are made to feel that they are unworthy to partake of human food; for it is swinish gluttony <span class="cite-ref">(529)</span> to squander wickedly what was given for the support of life. <span class="cite-ref">(530)</span> As to the ingenious exposition which some have brought forward, that it is the just punishment of wicked scorn, when those who have rejected delicious bread in the house of our heavenly Father are driven by hunger to eat <em>husks</em>, it is a true and useful doctrine; but in the meantime, we must bear in mind the difference that exists between allegories and the natural meaning. <span class="cite-ref">(531)</span></p><p><em>And was desirous to fill his belly. </em>This means that, in consequence of hunger, he no longer thought of his former luxuries, but greedily devoured <em>husks; </em>for of that kind of food he could not be in want, when he was giving it to the <em>swine </em>There is a well-known saying of Cyrus who, having for a long time suffered hunger during a flight, and having been slightly refreshed by eating coarse black bread, declared that he had never tasted savory bread till now; so the young man who is here mentioned was compelled by necessity to betake himself with appetite to <em>husks </em>The reason is added, <em>because no man gave to him; </em>for the copulative conjunction <em>and </em>( <span class="lang el-gr">καὶ</span>) must, in my opinion, signify <em>because</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(532)</span> and what is here said does not refer to <em>husks</em>, which he had at hand, but I understand the meaning to be, that no man pitied his poverty; for prodigals who throw away the whole of their property are persons whom no man thinks himself bound to relieve, — nay more, as they have been accustomed to squander every thing, men think that nothing ought to be given to them. <span class="cite-ref">(533)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(524)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Delaissant le bon vieil hemme de pere</span>;” — “leaving the good old man his father.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(525)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais aussi diminue le bien de la maison, et en emporte une bonne partie</span>;” — “but also diminishes the wealth of the house, and carries off a good part of it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(526)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tout ce qu’il avoit eu du pere</span>;” — “all that he had got from his father.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(527)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il avoit bien merite de trouver puis apres un pere rigoreux, et qui teint son coeur contre luy iusqu’au bout</span>;” — “he had well deserved to find afterwards a father who was severe, and who kept his heart shut against him to the end.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(528)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource que ie me tien maintenant dans mes limites, et ne veux point passer l’office d’expositeur</span>;” — “because I now keep myself within my limits, and do not wish to go beyond the duty of an expositor.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(529)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est une gourmandise plustost convenable a des porceaux qu’a des hommes</span>;” — “it is a gluttony more suitable to swine than to men.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(530)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour subvenir aux necessitez de ceste vie</span>;” — “to supply the necessities of this life.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(531)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais cependant il faut tousiours aviser quelle difference il y a entre les allegories et le vray sens naturel d’un passage</span>;” — “but yet we must always consider what difference there is between allegories and the true natural meaning of a passage.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(532)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car selon mon avis ce mot et se doit resoudre en Car, ou Pource que</span>;” — “for in my opinion this word <em>and </em>must mean <em>For</em>, or <em>Because</em>. <em>” </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(533)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il semble que ce qu’on leur donne soit autant de perdu</span>;” — “what is given to them appears to be as good as thrown away.” </p></div></div>
