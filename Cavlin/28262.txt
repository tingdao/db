<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Repaying to no one, etc. </em>This differs but little from what shortly after follows, except that revenge is more than the kind of repaying of which he speaks here; for we render evil for evil sometimes, even when we exact not the requiting of an injury, as when we treat unkindly those who do us no good. We are indeed wont to form an estimate of the deserts of each, or of what they merit at our hands, so that we may confer our benefits on those, by whom we have been already obliged, or from whom we expect something: and again, when any one denies help to us when we need it, we, by returning like for like, as they say, do not help him in time of need, any more than he assisted us. There are also other instances of the same kind, in which evil is rendered for evil, when there is no open revenge. </p><p><em>Providing good things, etc. </em>I no not disapprove of the rendering of [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>] <em>, </em>“Providently preparing,” <em>( </em><em>Provide parantes </em><em>;) </em>but I prefer a literal rendering. As every one is more than justly devoted to his own advantage, and provident in avoiding losses, Paul seems to require a care and an attention of another kind. What is meant is, that we ought diligently to labor, that all may be edified by our honest dealings. For as purity of conscience is necessary for us before God, so uprightness of character before men is not to be neglected: for since it is meet that God should be glorified by our good deeds, even so much is wanting to his glory, as there is a deficiency of what is praiseworthy in us; and not only the glory of God is thus obscured, but he is branded with reproach; for whatever sin we commit, the ignorant employ it for the purpose of calumniating the gospel. </p><p>But when we are bidden to prepare good things before men, <span class="cite-ref">(396)</span> we must at the same time notice for what purpose: it is not indeed that men may admire and praise us, as this is a desire which Christ carefully forbids us to indulge, since he bids us to admit God alone as the witness of our good deeds, to the exclusion of all men; but that their minds being elevated to God, they may give praise to him, that by our example they may be stirred up to the practice of righteousness, that they may, in a word, perceive the good and the sweet odor of our life, by which they may be allured to the love of God. But if we are evil spoken of for the name of Christ, we are by no means to neglect to provide good things before men: for fulfilled then shall be that saying, that we are counted as false, and are yet true. (<span class="bvs">2Co_6:8</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(396)</span> “Providentes bona<span class="lang el-gr">;” προνοούμενοι καλὰ; </span> “procurantes honesta — providing honest things,” [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>]; “providing things reputable,” [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>]; “premeditating things comely,” [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>]. The participle means to mind beforehand, to prepare, to provide, and also to take care of or to attend to a thing. “Attending to things honorable” may be the rendering here. The adjective<span class="lang el-gr">καλὸς, </span> means fair, good; and good in conduct as here is not “comely,” but just, right, or reputable, as [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] renders it. The word “honest” does not now retain its original idea of honorable. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
