<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>For my thoughts are not your thoughts. </em>This passage is expounded in various ways. Some think that it condemns universally the life of men, that they may not be satisfied with it or flatter their vices; for we cannot approach to God but by taking away a false conviction of our own righteousness. And indeed none call for physicians but those who are driven by the violence of disease to seek both health and remedies. Accordingly, this passage is compared by them to that saying of our Lord, </p><p>“What ranks high among men is abomination in the sight of God.” (<span class="bvs">Luk_16:15</span>) </p><p>But the Prophet’s meaning, I think, is different, and is more correctly explained, according to my judgment, by other commentators, who think that he draws a distinction between God’s disposition and man’s disposition. Men are wont to judge and measure God from themselves; for their hearts are moved by angry passions, and are very difficult to be appeased; and therefore they think that they cannot be reconciled to God, when they have once offended him. But the Lord shows that he is far from resembling men. As if he had said, “I am not a mortal man, that I should show myself to be harsh and irreconcilable to you. <span class="cite-ref">(87)</span> My thoughts are very different from yours. If you are implacable, and can with difficulty be brought back to a state of friendship with those from whom you have received an injury, I am not like you, that I should treat you so cruelly.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(87)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour vous estre rude et ennemi a jamais</span>.” “So as to be harsh and an enemy to you for ever.” </p></div></div>
