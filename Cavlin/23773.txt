<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>His disciples say to him. </em>As if it were a hard condition for husbands to be so bound to their wives, that, so long as they remain chaste, they are compelled to endure every thing rather than leave them, the disciples, roused by this answer of Christ, reply, that it is better to want wives than to submit to a knot of this kind. <span class="cite-ref">(603)</span> But why do they not, on the other hand, consider how hard is the bondage of wives, <span class="cite-ref">(604)</span> but because, devoted to themselves and their own convenience, they are driven by the feeling of the flesh to disregard others, and to think only of what is advantageous for themselves? Meanwhile, it is a display of base ingratitude that, from the dread or dislike of a single inconvenience, they reject a wonderful gift of God. It is better, according to them, to avoid marriage than to bind one’s self by the bond of living always together. <span class="cite-ref">(605)</span> But if God has ordained marriage for the general advantage of mankind, though it may be attended by some things that are disagreeable, it is not on that account to be despised. Let us therefore learn not to be delicate and saucy, but to use with reverence the gifts of God, even if there be something in them that does not please us. Above all, let us guard against this wickedness in reference to holy marriage; for, in consequence of its being attended by many annoyances, Satan has always endeavored to make it an object of hatred and detestation, in order to withdraw men from it. And Jerome has given too manifest a proof of a malicious and wicked disposition, in not only loading with calumnies that sacred and divinely appointed condition of life, but in collecting as many terms of reproach ( <span class="lang el-gr">λοιδορίας</span>) as he could from profane authors, in order to take away its respectability. But let us recollect that whatever annoyances belong to marriage are accidental, for they arise out of the depravity of man. Let us remember that, since our nature was corrupted, marriage began to be a medicine, and therefore we need not wonder if it have a bitter taste mixed with its sweetness. But we must see how our Lord confutes this folly. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(603)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que de se mettre en une telle necessite et suiection</span>;” — “than to place one’s self under such restraint and subjection.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(604)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La servitude que les femmes ont a porter</span>;” — “the bondage of which wives have to endure.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(605)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De vivre tousiours avec une femme</span>;” — “of living always with one wife.” </p></div></div>
