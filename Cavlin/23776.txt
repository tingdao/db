<div class="comment-content"><p>This narrative is highly useful; for it shows that Christ receives not only those who, moved by holy desire and faith, freely approach to him, but those who are not yet of age to know how much they need his grace. Those <em>little children </em>have not yet any understanding to desire his blessing; but when they are presented to him, he gently and kindly receives them, and dedicates them to the Father <span class="cite-ref">(611)</span> by a solemn act of blessing. We must observe the intention of those who present the children; for if there had not been a deep-rooted conviction in their minds, that the power of the Spirit was at his disposal, that he might pour it out on the people of God, it would have been unreasonable to present their children. There is no room, therefore, to doubt, that they ask for them a participation of his grace; and so, by way of amplification, Luke adds the particle <em>also</em>; as if he had said that, after they had experienced the various ways in which he assisted adults, they formed an expectation likewise in regard to <em>children</em>, that, if he <em>laid hands on them</em>, they would not leave him without having received some of the gifts of the Spirit. The <em>laying on of hands </em>(as we have said on a former occasion) was an ancient and well known sign of <em>blessing</em>; and so there is no reason to wonder, if they desire that Christ, while employing that solemn ceremony, should pray for the <em>children </em>At the same time, as <em>the inferior are blessed by the better</em>, (<span class="bvs">Heb_7:7</span>,) they ascribe to him the power and honor of the highest Prophet. </p><p><span class="bvs">Mat_19:13</span><strong>.</strong><em>But the disciples rebuked them. </em>If a crown <span class="cite-ref">(612)</span> had been put on his head, they would have admitted it willingly, and with approbation; for they did not yet comprehend his actual office. But they reckon it unworthy of his character to receive <em>children</em>; and their error wanted not plausibility; for what has the highest Prophet and the Son of God to do with <em>infants? </em>But hence we learn, that they who judge of Christ according to the feeling of their flesh are unfair judges; for they constantly deprive him of his peculiar excellencies, and, on the other hand, ascribe, under the appearance of honor, what does not at all belong to him. Hence arose an immense mass of superstitions, which presented to the world a fancied Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(613)</span> And therefore let us learn not to think of him otherwise than what himself teaches, and not to assign to him a character different from what he has received from the Father. We see what happened with Popery. They thought that they were conferring a great honor on Christ, if they bowed down before a small piece of bread; but in the sight of God it was an offensive abomination. Again, because they did not think it sufficiently honorable to him to perform the office of an Advocate for us, they made for themselves innumerable intercessors; but in this way they deprived him of the honor of Mediator. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(611)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A Dieu son Pere</span>;” — “to God his Father.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(612)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Une couronne royale</span>;” — “a royal crown.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(613)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Un Christ faict a la fantasie des hommes</span>;” — “a Christ made according to the fancy of men.” </p></div></div>
