<div class="comment-content"><p>This narrative is at present omitted by Luke, because he had explained it on a former occasion; and for my own part, as I am unwilling to annoy my readers by writing the same thing twice, I shall handle this passage with greater brevity <span class="cite-ref">(354)</span> The Evangelists relate that John was seized, because he had openly condemned <em>Herod </em>for carrying off <em>Herodias, </em>and for his incestuous marriage with her. Josephus assigns a different reason, namely, that Herod, dreading on his own account a change of affairs, regarded John with suspicion, (Ant. 18. 5:2;) and it is possible that this may have been the pretext on which the tyrant excused his crime, or that such a report may have been in circulation; for it frequently happens that various motives are assigned for unjust violence and cruelty. The true state of the fact, however, is pointed out by the Evangelists: Herod was offended at the holy man, because he had been reproved by him. </p><p>Josephus is mistaken in supposing that Herodias was carried off, not from his brother Philip, but from Herod, King of Chalcis, his uncle, (Ant. 18:5:4.) For not only was the crime still recent when the Evangelists wrote, but it was committed before the eyes of all. What is elsewhere stated by Josephus, (Ant. 18:4:6,) that Philip was a person of amiable dispositions, emboldened Herod, I have no doubt, to expect that an outrage committed on a mild, gentle, and peaceable man, would pass with impunity. Another probable conjecture may be mentioned. There is greater reason to suppose that Herodias was married to her uncle Philip than to her grand-uncle, her grandfather’s brother, who must have been at that time in the decrepitude of old age. Now Herod Antipas (who is here mentioned) and Philip were not brothers by the same mother; for Herod was the son of Marthaca, third wife of Herod the Great, and Philip was the son of Cleopatra. <span class="cite-ref">(355)</span></p><p>To return to the Evangelists, they tell us that John was thrown into prison, because he had reproved Herod’s crime with greater freedom than the ferocity of the tyrant would endure. The atrocious character of the deed was in itself sufficiently detestable and infamous; for not only did he keep in his own house another man’s wife, whom he had torn away from lawful wedlock, but the person on whom he had committed this outrage was his own brother. When, in addition to this, he is freely reproved by John, Herod has some reason to fear that sedition will suddenly break out. His lust did not allow him to correct his fault; but having imprisoned the prophet of God, he promises to himself repose and liberty. <span class="cite-ref">(356)</span></p><p>Ignorance of history has led many persons into a fruitless debate; “Have I a right to marry the woman who was formerly married to my brother?” Though the modesty of nature recoils from such a marriage, <span class="cite-ref">(357)</span> yet John condemns the rape still more than the incest; for it was by violence or by stratagem <span class="cite-ref">(358)</span> that Herod had deprived his brother of his lawful wife: and otherwise it would have been less lawful for him to marry his niece than to marry his brother’s widow. There cannot be a doubt, that a crime so flagrant was universally blamed. But others loaded Herod with their curses in his absence. John alone comes into his presence, and reproves him boldly to his face, if by any means he may be brought to repentance. Hence we learn with what unshaken fortitude the servants of God ought to be armed when they have to do with princes; for in almost every court hypocrisy and servile flattery are prevalent; and the ears of princes, having been accustomed to this smooth language, do not tolerate any voice which reproves their vices with any severity. But as a prophet of God ought not to overlook so shocking a crime, John steps forward, though a disagreeable and unwelcome adviser, and, rather than fail in his duty, scruples not to incur the frown of the tyrant, even though he knew Herod to be so strongly held by the snares of the prostitute, that he could scarcely be moved from his purpose. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(354)</span> The allusion is to his exposition of <span class="bvs">Luk_3:19</span>, which will be found in <em>Harmony, </em>vol. 1. p. 222. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(355)</span> “The apparent discrepancy between Josephus and the sacred historians is removed, as was formerly suggested, <em>(Harmony, </em>vol. 1. p. 223, n. 1,) by a hypothesis which appears to be generally admitted, that the name of the person in question was <em>Herod-Philip. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(356)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il se fait accroire qu’il sera en repos, et qu’il pourra continuer sa meschancete sans aucune crainte</span>;” — “he makes himself believe that he will be at ease, and that he will have it in his power to continue his wickedness without any dread.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(357)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien que l’honneste naturelle condamne un tel marriage</span>;” — “though natural decency condemns such a marriage.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(358)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ou par force et violence, ou par quelque ruse et moyen subtil</span>;” — “either by force and violence, or by some trick and cunning method.” </p></div></div>
