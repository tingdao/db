<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>And ye shall take you on the first day. </em>By this symbol the Jews were instructed that this day was to be celebrated with joy and gladness; for it was not only a memorial of the favor which He had graciously bestowed on their fathers in the desert, when they were exposed to all the vicissitudes of heaven, <span class="cite-ref">(356)</span> and He cherished them under His wings as an eagle does her brood; but it was also an act of thanksgiving, because He had provided them so commodious a reception in the Promised Land; thus, by carrying the boughs, they proclaimed their joy and triumph as it were. Nor would it have been reasonable that they should go into the booths in sorrow and sadness, since they represented visibly to them both the former and present goodness of God, and at the same time gave them a foretaste of the life of heaven, inasmuch as they were but sojourners on earth. Some suppose <span class="lang he-il">הדר</span>, <em>hadar, </em><span class="cite-ref">(357)</span> to be a proper name, but since it everywhere means “comeliness,” I have been unwilling to depart from its ordinary sense; nor do I curiously insist on the words, except so far as it is necessary to ascertain the actual substance. </p><p><strong>(356)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De pluyes, de gresles, de froid, et de chaud</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(357)</strong> “The Jews limit this to the <em>citron; </em>but this is a mere tradition of men. The words mean any tree whatsoever that was attractive and goodly. Jahn says, ‘Any noble tree, such as the palm, or the malum Punicum.’ So Rosenmuller.” — Bonar <em>in loco. </em></p></div>
