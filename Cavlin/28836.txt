<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>When I had come to Troas </em>By now mentioning what he had been doing in the mean time, in what places he had been, and what route he had pursued in his journeyings, he more and more confirms what he had said previously as to his coming to the Corinthians. He says that he had come to Troas from Ephesus for the sake of the gospel, for he would not have proceeded in that direction, when going into Achaia, had he not been desirous to pass through Macedonia. As, however, he did not find Titus there, whom he had sent to Corinth, and by whom he ought to have been informed respecting the state of that Church, though he might have done much good there, and though he had an opportunity presented to him, yet, he says, setting everything aside, he came to Macedonia, desirous to see Titus. Here is an evidence of a singular degree of attachment to the Corinthians, that he was so anxious respecting them, that he <em>had no rest </em>anywhere, even when a large prospect of usefulness presented itself, until he had learned the state of their affairs. Hence it appears why it was that he delayed his coming. He did not wish to come to them until he had learned the state of their affairs. Hence it appears, why it was that he delayed his coming. He did not wish to come to them, until he had first had a conversation with Titus. He afterwards learned from the report brought him by Titus, that matters were at that time not yet ripe for his coming to them. Hence it is evident, that Paul loved the Corinthians so much, that he accommodated all his journeyings and long circuits to their welfare, and that he had accordingly come to them later than he had promised — not from having, in forgetfulness of his promise, rashly changed his plan, or from having been carried away by some degree of <em>fickleness, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_1:17</span>,) but because delay was more profitable for them. </p><p><em>A door also having been opened to me. </em>We have spoken of this metaphor when commenting on the last chapter of the First Epistle. (<span class="bvs">1Co_16:9</span>.) Its meaning is, that an opportunity of promoting the gospel had presented itself. <span class="cite-ref">(334)</span> For as an opportunity of entering is furnished when the <em>door is opened, </em>so the servants of the Lord make advances when an opportunity is presented. The <em>door is shut, </em>when no prospect of usefulness is held out. Now as, on the door being shut, it becomes us to enter upon a new course, rather than by farther efforts to weary ourselves to no purpose by useless labor, so where an opportunity presents itself of edifying, let us consider that by the hand of God a door is opened to us for introducing Christ there, and let us not withhold compliance with so kind an indication from God. <span class="cite-ref">(335)</span></p><p>It may seem, however, as if Paul had erred in this — that disregarding, or at least leaving unimproved, an opportunity that was placed within his reach, he betook himself to Macedonia. “Ought he not rather to have applied himself to the work that he had in hand, than, after making little more than a commencement, break away all on a sudden in another direction?” We have also observed already, that the <em>opening of a door </em>is an evidence of a divine call, and this is undoubtedly true. I answer, that, as Paul was not by any means restricted to one Church, but was bound to many at the same time, it was not his duty, in consequence of the present aspect of one of them, to leave off concern as to the others. Farther, the more connection he had with the Corinthian Church, it was his duty to be so much the more inclined to aid it; for we must consider it to be reasonable, that a Church, which he had founded by his ministry, should be regarded by him with a singular affection <span class="cite-ref">(336)</span> — just as at this day it is our duty, indeed, to promote the welfare of the whole Church, and to be concerned for the entire body of it; and yet, every one has, nevertheless, a closer and holier connection with his own Church, to whose interests he is more particularly devoted. Matters were in an unhappy state at Corinth, so that Paul was in no ordinary degree anxious as to the issue. It is not, therefore, to be wondered, if, under the influence of this motive, he left unimproved an opportunity that in other circumstances was not to be neglected; as it was not in his power to occupy every post of duty at one and the same time. It is not, however, at all likely that he left Troas, till he had first introduced some one in his place to improve the opening that had occurred. <span class="cite-ref">(337)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(334)</span> Elsner, when commenting on 1 Corinthains 16:9, “<em>a great door and effectual is opened</em>, ” after quoting a variety of passages from Latin and Greek authors, in which a corresponding metaphor is employed, observes that Rabbinical writers employ in the same sense the term <span class="lang he-il">פתח</span>, (<em>phethach</em>,) a gate. Thus Raschi, when speaking of the question proposed to Hagar by the angel, (<em>Whence camest thou </em>? <span class="bvs">Gen_16:8</span>,) remarks: “Noverat id (angelus) sed (interrogavit) ut<span class="lang he-il">פתח</span>, januam, ei daret colloquendi;” — “He (the angel) knew this, but (he proposed the question) that he might afford her an opportunity of speaking to him.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(335)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne refusons point de nous employer en ce que nous pourrons seruir, quand nous voyons que Dieu nous y inuite si liberalement</span>;” — “Let us not refuse to employ ourselves in rendering what service we can, when we see that God invites us so kindly.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(336)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Fust aimee de luy d’vne affection singuliere et speciale</span>;” — “Should be loved by him with a singular and special affection.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(337)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">L’ouuerture que Dieu auoit faite</span>;” — “The opening that God had made.” </p></div></div>
