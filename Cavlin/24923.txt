<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>When she had seen him, she was agitated </em>Luke does not say that <em>she was agitated </em>by the presence of the angel, but <em>by his address. </em>Why then does he also mention his presence? <span class="cite-ref">(24)</span> The reason, I think, is this. Perceiving in the angel something of heavenly glory, she was seized with sudden dread arising out of reverence for God. <em>She was agitated, </em>because she felt that she had received a salutation, not from a mortal man, but from an angel of God. But Luke does not say that she was so <em>agitated </em>as to have lost recollection. On the contrary, he mentions an indication of an attentive and composed mind; for he afterwards adds, <em>and was considering what that salutation would be: </em>that is, what was its object, and what was its meaning. It instantly occurred to her that the angel had not been sent for a trifling purpose. This example reminds us, first, that we ought not to be careless observers of the works of God; and, secondly, that our consideration of them ought to be regulated by fear and reverence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(24)</span> “Cur ergo aspectus etiam meminit ?” Calvin's allusion is brought out more clearly in his own vernacular. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pourquoy donc dit-il, Quand elle l'eut veu</span> ?” — “Why then does he say,<em>When she had seen him?” </em></p></div></div>
