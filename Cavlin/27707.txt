<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>I am a Jew. </em>As all things were out of order at that day among the Jews, many rogues and vagabonds, to the end they might have some shroud for their wickedness, did falsely boast that they were Jews. Therefore, to the end Paul may acquit himself of this suspicion, he beginneth at his birth; that done, he declareth that he was known in Jerusalem, because he was brought up there of [from] a child; though this latter thing seemeth to be spoken not only for certainty’s sake, but because it skilled much that this should also be known how well he had been instructed.</p><p>There is nothing more bold to cause trouble than unlearned men. And at that day the government of the Church was so decayed, that religion was not only subject to sects, but also miserably mangled and torn in pieces. Therefore, Paul nameth his master, lest any man may think that he had not been nousled up in learning,<span class="cite-ref">(498)</span> and therefore had he forsaken the worship of the fathers; as many men, who are not trained up in learning, forget their nature and grow out of kind.<span class="cite-ref">(499)</span> But Paul saith chiefly that he was well taught in the law, that the Jews may understand that it was not through ignorance (as it falleth out oftentimes) that he causeth such ado, and doth counterfeit their monsters.</p><p>It is to be doubted whether this be that Gamaliel of whom mention is made before, ( <span class="bvs">Act_5:34</span>). Scholars are said to sit at their masters’ feet, because forasmuch as they be not as­ yet of strong and sound judgment, they must bring such modesty and aptness to be taught, that they must make all their senses subject to their masters, and must depend upon their mouth. So Mary is said to sit at Jesus’ feet ( <span class="bvs">Luk_10:39</span>) when she giveth ear to his doctrine. But and if such reverence be due to earthly masters, how much more ought we to prostrate ourselves before the feet of Christ, that we may give ear to him when he teacheth us out of his heavenly throne? This speech doth also put boys and young men in remembrance of their duty, that they be not stout nor stubborn, or that they be not puffed nor lifted up against their masters through some foolish confidence, but that they suffer themselves quietly and gently to be framed by them.</p><p><em>Taught in the law of the fathers. </em>The old interpreter doth translate it word for word, taught <em>according to the truth of the fathers’ law, </em>saving that <span class="lang el-gr">ἀκρίβεια</span> is rather a <em>perfect way </em><span class="cite-ref">(500)</span> than <em>truth. </em>Notwithstanding the question is, What he meaneth by this perfect way, seeing all of them had one and the same form of the law? He seemeth to me to distinguish that purer form of knowledge wherein he had been trained up from the common instruction, which did more disagree with the true and natural meaning of the law. And although the law of the Lord was then corrupt by many additions, even among the best doctors, yet because religion was altogether there corrupt among many, Paul doth for good causes boast, that he was both well and also diligently instructed in the law of the fathers; or (which is all one) exactly or perfectly, lest any man should think that he had gotten only some small smattering, as if he were one of the common sort.</p><p>But because many who are well taught are, notwithstanding, full stuffed with Epicurish contempt of God, he declareth that he was zealous toward God; as if he should say, that the serious study of godliness was annexed to doctrine, so that he meant not to daily in holy things, as profane men do of set purpose confound all things.</p><p>But because this his zeal was altogether rash, he maketh himself like to the other Jews for that time. Notwithstanding, this may be taken in good part, that he did long ago no less worship God from his heart than they did then.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(498)</span></p><p>“ Nulla disciplina imbutum,” not imbued with any discipline. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(499)</span></p><p>“ Fiunt degeneres,” become degenerate, </p><p><span class="cite-note">(500)</span></p><p>“ Exacta ratio,” an exact method. </p></div></div>
