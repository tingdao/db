<div class="comment-content"><p>As to the word <span class="lang he-il">כנה</span>, <em>cannah, </em><span class="cite-ref">(398)</span> in the beginning of the 15<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, I readily acquiesce in the sense given of it by some who translate it, <em>a place prepared; </em>but as some think that there is a change in the Hebrew word of the letter <span class="lang he-il">ג</span>, <em>gimel, </em>into <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>, <em>caph, </em>so that the reading should be <span class="lang he-il">גנה</span>, <em>gannah, a garden </em>or <em>vineyard, </em>we leave the reader to judge for himself. It is, however, certain that this is a metaphor akin to the former, by which is denoted the singular liberality of God in advancing this people, and causing them to prosper. The vine-branch which was planted by the hand of God is also called <em>the Man of his right hand. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(398)</span> “Surely, <span class="lang he-il">כנה</span>, should not be translated <em>vineyard</em>, but <em>plant</em>: and probably <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> should be translated, or understood to mean, <em>even </em>See Noldius, <em>Sign</em>. 38.” —<em>Arcbishop Secker </em>“Michaelis and Gesenius derive it from <span class="lang he-il">כנן</span>, <em>texit</em>, with the suffix <span class="lang he-il">ה</span>.
