<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet denounces here by another similitude the vengeance of God, for he says that all would be <em>filled with drunkenness: </em>but he is bidden at first simply to set before <em>them </em>the metaphor, <em>Every bottle</em>, or flagon, he says, <em>shall be filled with wine </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">רבל</span>, <em>ubel, </em>means a bladder; but the word bottle is more suitable here. <span class="cite-ref">(75)</span> Bladders were wont in those countries to be filled with water and with wine, as the custom is still in the east; as we see at this day that oil is put in bladders and thus carried, so bladders are commonly used there to carry water and wine; but as it is added, <em>I will dash them against one another, </em>it is better to use the word bottles, or flagons. </p><p>This general statement might have appeared to be of no weight; for what instruction does this contain, “Every bottle shall be filled with wine?” It is like what one might say, — that a tankard is made to carry wine, and that bowls are made for drinking: this is well known, even to children. And then it might have been said that this was unworthy of a prophet. “Eh! what dost thou say? Thou sayest that bottles are the receptacles of wine, even as a hat is made to cover the head, or clothes to keep off the cold; but thou seemest to mock us with childish trifles.” We also find that the Prophet’s address was thus objected to, for they contemptuously and proudly answered, “What! do we not know that bottles are prepared for the purpose of preserving wine? But what dost thou mean? Thou boastest of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit: how strange is this? Thou art, like an angel come down from heaven; thou pretendest the name of God, and professest to have the authority of a prophet; now, what does this mean, that bottles are filled with wine?” But it was God’s particular object thus to rouse the people, who were asleep in their delusions, and who were also by no means attentive to spiritual instruction. It was then his purpose to shew, by the most trifling, and as it were by frivolous things, that they were not possessed of so much clear-sightedness as to perceive even that which was most evident. They indeed, all knew that bottles were made for wine; but they did not understand that they were the bottles, or were like bottles. We have indeed said that they were inflated with so much arrogance that they seemed like hard rocks; and hence was their contempt of all threatenings, because they did not consider what they were. The Prophet then says that they were like bottles; though God had indeed chosen them for an excellent use, yet, forgetful of their frailty, they had marred their own excellency, so that they were no longer of any use, except that God would inebriate them with giddiness and also with calamities. </p><p>We hence see why God had commanded a general truth to be here announced which was received with indifference and contempt; it was, that an opportunity might be given to the Prophet to touch to the quick those stupid men to whom their own state was wholly unknown. It had been said that they were like mountains, because they had as their foundation the free election of God; but as they had in them no firmness and no constancy of faith, but had decayed, their glory had as it were melted away; and though they still retained an outward appearance, yet they were like brittle vessels; and so their fragility is here better expressed by the Prophet than if, in a plain sentence, he had said, “As a bottle is filled with wine, so will the Lord fill you with drunkenness.” Had he thus spoken, there would not have been so much force in the prediction; but when they answered with disdain, “This is known even to children,” they were then told what more sensibly touched them, — that they were like bottles. <span class="cite-ref">(76)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(75)</span> It is not true that the word ever means a bladder, though so rendered by the <em>Septuagint </em>and the <em>Targum. </em>The <em>Vulgate </em>has “laguncula — a little flagon,” and <em>Syriac </em>“dolium, — a tub.” It means a jug or jar. <em>Blayney </em>has “vessel.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(76)</span> With regard to this comparison, <em>Gataker </em>says, “A type taken from what they much loved, liked, and looked after; for they loved and looked after the <em>flagons of wine, </em><span class="bvs">Hos_3:1</span>; and those prophets best pleased them who prophesied of <em>wine and strong drink, </em><span class="bvs">Mic_2:11</span>. God therefore sendeth his prophet to them with a prophecy of <em>wine, </em>but of other wine than they expected.” </p></div></div>
