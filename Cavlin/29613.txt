<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>And we exhort you</em>. Though he declares that they were sufficiently prepared of themselves for all offices of love, he nevertheless does not cease to exhort them to make progress, there being no perfection in men. And, unquestionably, whatever appears in us in a high state of excellence, we must still desire that it may become better. Some connect the verb <span class="lang el-gr">φιλοτιμεῖσζαι </span> with what follows, as if he exhorted them to strive at the maintaining of peace; but it corresponds better with the expression that goes before. For after having admonished them to increase in love, he recommends to them a sacred emulation, that they may strive among themselves in mutual affection, or at least he enjoins that each one strive to conquer himself; <span class="cite-ref">(572)</span> and I rather adopt this latter interpretation. That, therefore, their love may be perfect, he requires that there be a striving among them, such as is wont to be on the part of those who eagerly <span class="cite-ref">(573)</span> aspire at victory. This is the best emulation, when each one strives to overcome himself in doing good. As to my not subscribing to the opinion of those who render the words, <em>strive to maintain peace</em>, this single reason appears to me to be sufficiently valid — that Paul would not in a thing of less difficulty have enjoined so arduous a conflict — which suits admirably well with advancement in love, where so many hindrances present themselves. Nor would I have any objection to the other meaning of the verb — that they should exercise liberality generally towards others. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(572)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En cest endroit</span>;” — “In this matter.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(573)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Courageusement et d’vn grand desir</span>;” — “Courageously and wait a great desire.” </p></div></div>
