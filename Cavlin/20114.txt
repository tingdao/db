<div class="comment-content"><p>He pursues the same metaphor or comparison; for he says that all places would be laid waste and desolate, which before had been valuable and highly regarded on account of their fruitfulness. <em>Cease </em>then <em>shall all rejoicing from the land of Moab</em>, however fruitful it might have been. And then he adds, <em>I will make the wine to cease from the presses</em>; that is, no one shall press the grapes, that from them the wine may flow. And he adds, <span class="lang he-il">הידד הידד</span>, <em>eidad</em>, <em>eidad</em>, <em>shouting, shouting, for there will be no shouting </em>Some render <span class="lang he-il">הידד</span>, <em>eidad</em>, “<em>signal</em>, ”<em>celeuma</em>, (<em>vel celeusma</em>,) a Greek word, but used also in Latin: <span class="lang el-gr">κέλευμα</span> is said by the Greeks to be the shouting of sailors, especially when they drive to the shore; they then rouse one another in rowing, and also congratulate one another, because they are nigh to land; for to see the harbor is a cause of special joy to sailors, as though it were a restoration to life and safety. But this word <span class="lang el-gr">κέλευμα</span> is applied to other things, as it may be said that reapers sing a<em>celeusma </em>when they finish their work. The vine-dressers had also their songs; and they were sung by heathen nations, as Virgil says. “Now the worn-out vine-dresser sings at the extreme rows of vines.” <span class="cite-ref">(18)</span> By extreme rows or ranks he seems to mean the extreme parts of the vines; for extreme rows (<em>antes</em>) are properly prominences or overhanging stones. Now when they had come to the end, they sang and congratulated themselves as to the vintage. It was then a common custom among all nations. </p><p>The Prophet, now alluding to this, says, “They who shall tread in the winepress shall not be as usual joyful, so as to have their shouting, shouting, <span class="lang he-il">הידד הידד</span>, <em>eidad</em>, <em>eidad</em>. ” He repeats the word, because men greatly exult at the vintage, and are excessive in their rejoicings. This is the reason why the Prophet mentions the word twice. He then adds, <em>there shall be no shouting</em>, <span class="lang he-il">לא הידד</span>,<em>la eidad</em>, because there would be no vineyards. Isaiah uses other expressions, but the meaning is the same. It now follows, — </p><p><strong>(18)</strong>Jam canit extremos effœtus vinitor antes. — <em>Geor</em>. 2:417. </p></div>
