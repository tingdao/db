<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Visible and invisible</em>. Both of these kinds were included in the foregoing distinction of <em>heavenly </em>and <em>earthly </em>things; but as Paul meant chiefly to make that affirmation in reference to Angels, he now makes mention of things invisible. Not only, therefore, have those heavenly creatures which are visible to our eyes, but spiritual creatures also, been created by the Son of God. What immediately follows, <em>whether thrones</em>, <em>etc.</em>, is as though he had said — “by whatever name they are called.” </p><p>By <em>thrones </em>some understand <em>Angels</em>. I am rather, however, of opinion, that the heavenly palace of God’s majesty is meant by the term, which we are not to imagine to be such as our mind can conceive of, but such as is suitable to God himself. We see the sun and moon, and the whole adorning of heaven, but the glory of God’s kingdom is hid from our perception, because it is spiritual, and above the heavens. In fine, let us understand by the term <em>thrones </em>that seat of blessed immortality which is exempted from all change. </p><p>By the other terms he undoubtedly describes the angels. He calls them <em>powers, principalities, </em>and <em>dominions, </em>not, as if they swayed any separate kingdom, or were endowed with peculiar power, <span class="cite-ref">(305)</span> but because they are the ministers of Divine power and dominion. <span class="cite-ref">(306)</span> It is customary, however, that, in so far as God manifests his power in creatures, his names are, in that proportion, transferred to them. Thus he is himself alone <em>Lord </em>and <em>Father</em>, but those are also called <em>lords </em>and <em>fathers </em>whom he dignifies with this honor. Hence it comes that angels, as well as judges, are called <em>gods</em>. <span class="cite-ref">(307)</span> Hence, in this passage also, angels are signalized by magnificent titles, which intimate, not what they can do of themselves, or apart from God, but what God does by them, and what functions he has assigned to them. These things it becomes us to understand in such a manner as to detract nothing from the glory of God alone; for he does not communicate his power to angels as to lessen his own; he does not work by them in such a manner as to resign his power to them; he does not desire that his glory should shine forth in them, so as to be obscured in himself. Paul, however, designedly extols the dignity of angels in terms thus magnificent, that no one may think that it stands in the way of Christ alone having the pre-eminence over them. He makes use, therefore, of these terms, as it were by way of concession, as though he had said, that all their excellence detracts nothing from Christ, <span class="cite-ref">(308)</span> however honorable the titles with which they are adorned. As for those who philosophize on these terms with excessive subtlety, that they may draw from them the different orders of angels, let them regale themselves with their dainties, but they are assuredly very remote from Paul’s design. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(305)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ayent vertu ou puissance d’eux — mesmes</span>;” — “Have power or authority of themselves.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(306)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sont executeurs de la puissance Diuine, et ministres de sa domination</span>;” — “Are the executors of God’s power, and ministers of his dominion.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(307)</span> See Calvin on John, vol. 1: p. 419. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(308)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">N’oste rien a la gloire de Christ</span>;” — “Takes nothing from the glory of Christ.” </p></div></div>
