<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved. The Psalmist now </em>shows that the great security of the Church consists in this, that God dwells in the midst of her; for the verb which we translate, <em>shall be moved, </em>is of the feminine gender, nor can it be referred to God, as if it were designed to teach that God is immovable. The sentence must be explained in this way, The holy city shall not be moved or shaken, because God dwells there, and is always ready to help her. The expression, <em>the dawn of the morning </em><span class="cite-ref">(177)</span> denotes<em>daily, </em>as soon as the sun rises upon the earth.

And he dwells amongst us for no other purpose than to preserve us uninjured. Moreover, although God does not always hasten immediately to our aid, according to the importunity of our desires, yet he will always come to us seasonably, so as to make apparent the truth of what is elsewhere said, </p><p>“Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_121:4</span>.) </p><p><strong>(177)</strong> “<em>At the looking forth of the morning</em>; that is, as the Greek explaineth it, ‘very early;’ when the morning peereth or showeth the face.” — <em>Ainsworth</em>. “<em>As soon as the morning appears </em>[or <em>shows </em>]<em>its face</em>; <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , God will come very early to her succor, before any enemy is awakened to annoy her.” —<em>Mudge</em>. “<em>Before the dawn of the morning</em>; <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , with the utmost readiness and alacrity.
