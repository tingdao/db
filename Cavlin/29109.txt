<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Know ye therefore</em>, or, <em>ye know</em>; for both readings are equally agreeable to the Greek termination<span class="lang el-gr">γινώσκετε. </span> But it matters little which is preferred, for the meaning is the same, only that the old translation, (<em>know ye</em>,) which I have followed, is more energetic. <span class="cite-ref">(58)</span> He says that those “are of faith,” who have relinquished all confidence in works, and rely on the promise of God alone. It is on the authority of Paul himself that we give this interpretation; for in the Epistle to the Romans he thus writes: </p><p>“To him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.” (<span class="bvs">Rom_4:4</span>.) </p><p>To be <em>of faith</em>, therefore, is to rest their righteousness and hope of salvation on the mercy of God. That such are the children of God he concludes from the preceding statement; for if Abraham was justified by faith those who wish to be his children must likewise abide firmly by faith. He has omitted one remark, which will be readily supplied, that there is no place in the church for any man who is not a son of Abraham. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(58)</span> “The scope of the passage shews that <span class="lang el-gr">γινώσκετε</span> is not the Indicative, but the Imperative. Paul does not presuppose that the Galatians acknowledge this principle; he is exerting himself to convince them of it.” — Brown. </p></div></div>
