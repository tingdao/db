<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And they heard the voice of the Lord God</em>. As soon as the voice of God sounds, Adam and Eve perceive that the leaves by which they thought themselves well protected are of no avail. Moses here relates nothing which does not remain in human nature, and may be clearly discerned at the present day. The difference between good and evil is engraven on the hearts of all, as Paul teaches, (<span class="bvs">Rom_2:15</span>;) but all bury the disgrace of their vices under flimsy leaves till God, by his voice, strikes inwardly their consciences. Hence, after God had shaken them out of their torpor, their alarmed consciences compelled them to hear his voice. Moreover, what Jerome translates, ‘at the breeze after midday,’ <span class="cite-ref">(180)</span> is, in the Hebrew, ‘at the wind of the day;’ <span class="cite-ref">(181)</span> the Greeks, omitting the word ‘wind,’ have put ‘at the evening.’ <span class="cite-ref">(182)</span> Thus the opinion has prevailed, that Adam, having sinned about noon, was called to judgment about sunset. But I rather incline to a different conjecture, namely, that being covered with their garment, they passed the night in silence and quiet, the darkness aiding their hypocrisy; then, about sunrise, being again thoroughly awakened, they recollected themselves. We know that at the rising of the sun the air is naturally excited; together, then, with this gentle breeze, God appeared; but Moses would improperly have called the <em>evening </em>air that of the <em>day</em>. Others take the word as describing the southern part or region; and certainly <span class="lang he-il">רוח</span> (<em>ruach</em>) sometimes among the Hebrews signifies one or another region of the world. <span class="cite-ref">(183)</span> Others think that the time is here specified as one least exposed to terrors, for in the clear light there is the greater security; and thus, they conceive, is fulfilled what the Scripture declares that they who have accusing consciences are always anxious and disquieted, even without any danger. To this point they refer what is added respecting the wind, as if Adam was terrified at the sound of a falling leaf. But what I have advanced is more true and simple, that what was hid under the darkness of the night was detected at the rising of the sun. Yet I do not doubt that some notable symbol of the presence of God was in that gentle breeze; for although (as I have lately said) the rising sun is wont daily to stir up some breath of air, this is not opposed to the supposition that God gave some extraordinary sign of his approach, to arouse the consciences of Adam and his wife. For, since he is in himself incomprehensible, he assumes, when he wishes to manifest himself to men, those marks by which he may be known. David calls the winds the messengers of God, on the wings of which he rides, or rather flies, with incredible velocity. (<span class="bvs">Psa_104:3</span>.) But, as often as he sees good, he uses the winds, as well as other created things, beyond the order of nature, according to his own will. Therefore, Moses, in here mentioning the wind, intimates (according to my judgment) that some unwonted and remarkable symbol of the Divine presence was put forth which should vehemently affect the minds of our first parents. This resource, namely, that of fleeing from God’s presence, was nothing better than the former; since God, with his voice alone, soon brings back the fugitives. It is. written, </p><p>‘Whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I traverse the sea, if I take wings and ascend above the clouds, if I descend into the profound abyss, thou, Lord, wilt be everywhere,’<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_139:7</span>.) </p><p>This we all confess to be true; yet we do not, in the meantime, cease to snatch at vain subterfuges; and we fancy that shadows of any kind will prove a most excellent defense. Nor is it to be here omitted, that he, who had found a few leaves to be unavailing, fled to whole trees; for so we are accustomed, when shut out from frivolous cavils, to frame new excuses, which may hide us as under a denser shade. When Moses says that Adam and his wife hid themselves ‘in the midst of the <em>tree </em><span class="cite-ref">(184)</span> of Paradise,’ I understand that the singular member is put for the plural; as if he had said, among the <em>trees</em>. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(180)</span> “Ad auram post meridiem.” Vulgate. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(181)</span><span class="lang he-il">לרוח היום</span>, (<em>leruach hayom</em>). </p><p><span class="cite-note">(182)</span><span class="lang el-gr">Τὸ δειλινόν</span>.

(See <span class="bvs">Jer_49:32</span>, and <span class="bvs">Jer_52:23</span>.) The common interpretation given in our version, “the cool of the day,” as applied to evening, is supported by the highest authorities, such as Cocceius, Schindler, Gesenius, and Lee. Le Clerc, however, adopts the same interpretation as Calvin. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(184)</span><span class="lang he-il">בתיך עץ הגו</span>.

It may be translated, “in the midst of the wood of Paradise;” and wood may be, as in English, used collectively for a number of trees, a forest, or a thicket. Calvin, in his version, translates the clause, “in medio arborum horti.” </p></div></div>
