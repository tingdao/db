<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>For this is good and acceptable before God</em>. After having taught that what he enjoined is useful, he now brings forward a stronger argument â€” that it pleases God; for when we know what is His will, this ought to have the force of all possible reasons. By <em>good </em>he means what is proper and lawful; and, since the will of God is the rule by which all our duties must be regulated, he proves that it is right because it pleases God. </p><p>This passage is highly worthy of observation; and, first, we draw from it the general doctrine, that the true rule for acting well and properly is to look to the will of God, and not to undertake anything but what he approves. Next, there is likewise laid down a rule for godly prayer, that we should follow God as our leader, and that all our prayer should be regulated by his will and command. If due force had been allowed to this argument, the prayers of Papists, in the present day, would not have abounded with so many corruptions. For how will they prove that they have the authority of God for having recourse to dead men as their intercessors, or for praying for the dead? In short, in all their form of prayer, what can they point out that is pleasing to God? </p></div>
