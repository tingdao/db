I have also employed the word <em>illustria </em><em>(illustrious) </em>in preference to <em>manifesta </em>, <em>(manifest,) </em>— as having ennobled the gospel by their fame. <span class="cite-ref">(56)</span> “Satan, indeed, has attempted it, and the wicked have thought that it would turn out so, that the gospel would be destroyed; but God has frustrated both the attempts of the former and the expectations of the latter, <span class="cite-ref">(57)</span> and that in two ways, for while the gospel was previously obscure and unknown, it has come to be well known, and not only so, but has even been rendered honorable in the <em>Praetorium </em>, no less than in the rest of the city.” By the <em>praetorium </em> I understand the hall and palace of Nero, which Fabius <span class="cite-ref">(58)</span> and writers of that age call <em>Augustale </em>, (<em>the Augustal.</em>) For as the name praetor was at first a general term, and denoted all magistrates who held the chief sway, (hence it came that the dictator was called the sovereign praetor, <span class="cite-ref">(59)</span>) it, consequently, became customary to employ the term <em>praetorium </em> in war to mean the tent, either of the consul, <span class="cite-ref">(60)</span> or of the person who <em>presided</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> while in the city it denoted the palace of Caesar, <span class="cite-ref">(62)</span> from the time that the Cesars took possession of the monarchy. <span class="cite-ref">(63)</span> Independently of this, the bench of praetor is also called the <em>praetorium </em><span class="cite-ref">(64)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(55)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ses liens ont este rendus celebres, et ont excellement serui a auancer la gloire de Christ</span>;” — “His bonds had become celebrated, and had admirably contributed to advance the glory of Christ.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(56)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource qu’il entend que le bruit qui auoit este de ses liens, auoit donné grand bruit a l’Euangile</span>;” — “Because he means that the fame, which had arisen from his bonds, had given great fame to the gospel.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(57)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Dieu a aneanti les efforts malicieux de Satan, et a frustré les meschans de leur attente</span>;” — “God has made void the malicious efforts of Satan, and has disappointed the wicked of their expectation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(58)</span> Our author has most probably in view an expression which occurs in the writings of <em>Quinctilian</em>, (Instit. Orator., lib. 8, 2, 8,) — “tabernaculum ducis Augustale;” — (“a general’s tent is called the Augustal.”) In the best editions of Quinctilian, however, the reading of <em>Augurale </em>, as synonymous with <em>auguraculum </em>, or <em>auguratorium </em>; — (<em>an apartment for the augur’s taking omens.</em>) — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(59)</span> The dictator is called by <em>Livey</em>, “<em>praetor maximus </em><em>; </em>” — “<em>the highest praetor. </em>” — (<em>Liv</em>. 7:3.) — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(60)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La tente ou du consul, ou de celuy qui estoit chef de l’armee, quelque nom qu’on luy donast</span>;” — “The tent of the consul, or of the person who was head of the army, whatever name was applied to him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(61)</span> “<em>Praeibat </em> ” — There is manifestly an allusion here to the etymology of praetor, as being derived from <em>praeire</em>, to <em>go before</em>, or <em>preside</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(62)</span> “At Rome it “(the term <em>praetorium </em>)” signified the public hall where causes were tried by the praetor; but more usually it denoted the camp or quarters of the praetorian cohorts without the city..... The name of <em>praetorium </em> was, in the provinces, given to the palace of the governors, both because they administered justice, and had their guards stationed in their residence. Hence it is inferred that, although the Apostle was at Rome when he wrote this, and although the circumstances to which he refers occurred in that city, yet, writing to persons residing in the provinces, he uses the word <em>praetorium </em>in the provincial sense, and means by it the <em>emperor’s palace</em>. ” — <em>Illustrated Commentary</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(63)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Depuis que les empereurs usurperent la monarchie</span>;” — “From the time that the emperors usurped the monarchy.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(64)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pretoire signifioit aussi le lieu ou le preteur tenoit la cour, et exerçoit sa iurisdiction</span>;” — “The praetorium signified also the place where the praetor held his court, and exercised jurisdiction.” </p></div></div>
