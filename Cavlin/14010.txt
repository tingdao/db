<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14</strong><em>Behold, he shall travail </em>David has hitherto shown how great and formidable the danger was which was near him. In this verse, laughing to scorn the presumptuous and foolish attempts of Saul, and his magnificent preparations, he declares that they had failed of accomplishing their object. <span class="cite-ref">(121)</span> By the demonstrative adverb <em>Behold, </em>he enhances the wonder, inasmuch as such a result fell out, on his part altogether unlooked for. <em>Behold, </em>says he, <em>after he has travailed to bring forth wickedness, like as he had conceived mischief, </em>at length there comes forth only empty wind and vanity, because God frustrated his expectations, and destroyed all these wicked attempts. <span class="cite-ref">(122)</span> Iniquity and mischief are here put for every kind of violence and outrage <span class="cite-ref">(123)</span> which Saul intended to inflict upon David. Some interpreters think that the order of the words is inverted, because <em>travailing to bring forth is </em>put before <em>conceiving; </em>but I think that the words have their proper place if you explain them thus: Behold, he shall travail to bring forth wickedness, for he hath conceived mischief; that is to say, as he long ago devised with himself my destruction, so he will do his utmost to put his design into execution. David afterwards adds, <em>he hath brought forth falsehood </em>This implies that Saul had been disappointed in his expectation; as Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_26:18</span>,) in like manner, speaks of unbelievers “bringing forth wind,” when their success does not correspond to their wicked and presumptuous attempts. As often, therefore, as we see the ungodly secretly plotting our ruin, let us remember that they speak falsehood to themselves; in other words deceive themselves, and shall fail in accomplishing what they devise in their hearts. <span class="cite-ref">(124)</span> If, however, we do not perceive that they are disappointed in their designs until they are about to be brought forth, let us not be cast down, but bear it with a spirit of patient submission to the will and providence of God. </p><p><strong>(121)</strong><em>“ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Disant que tout cela est alle en fumee</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “Saying that the whole ended in smoke.” </p><p><strong>(122)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource que Dieu l’a frustre de son attente et renverse toutes ces meschantes entreprises</span>.”—<em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(123)</strong><em>“ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Pour toutes violences et outrages</span>.”—<em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(124)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, se decoyvent et ne viendront a bout de ce qu’ils couvent en leurs coeurs</span>.”—<em>Fr. </em></p></div>
