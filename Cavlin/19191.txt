<div class="comment-content"><p>He at length concludes that God would take vengeance, but speaks in a figurativle language, <em>I will feed them with bitterness </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">לענה</span><em>lone, </em>is rendered “wormwood;” but as this is a wholesome herb, I prefer to render it “bitterness.” <span class="cite-ref">(249)</span> It is never found in a good sense, and therefore unsuitable to the nature of wormwood, which is often mentioned by Moses: and the other prophets (<span class="bvs">Deu_19:18</span>; <span class="bvs">Deu_32:32</span>; <span class="bvs">Heb_2:15</span>.) Hence I am inclined to adopt a general term, <em>“bitterness.” </em>He then adds, <em>I will give them poisonous waters to drink; </em><span class="cite-ref">(250)</span> as though God had said that he would execute a dreadful vengeance, so that it would appear in the meat and drink given them, which yet were remarkable testimonies of his paternal kindness towards them: for we cannot eat a crumb of bread nor drink a drop of water, except God’s goodness, and the care which he takes for our safety, shines upon us. Hence is that awful imprecation in <span class="bvs">Psa_69:22</span>, </p><p>“Turned let their table be into an offense.” </p><p>David also complained, when describing the barbarous cruelty of his enemies, that they gave him gall to drink: and we shall hereafter see what Jeremiah says; for in speaking. of his enemies, he says that they had conspired to put him to death, and said, </p><p>“Let us set wood for his bread.” (<span class="bvs">Jer_11:19</span>) </p><p>By these words then Jeremiah intended to express the dreadful vengeance of God; for he would not onty deprive the Jews of his benefits, but also turn their bread into poison, and their water into bitterness. </p><p>We now then perceive the Prophet’s meaning; and at the same time we must observe the expression, <em>the God of Israel </em>The foolish boasting, that they were the descendants of Abraham, and that they were a holy people, chosen by God, always deluded the Jews. In order then to check their glorying, the Prophet says, float the God who spoke to them was the God whose name they falsely professed, and that he was the God who had chosen the children of Abraham as his peculiar people. It follows — </p><p><strong>(249)</strong> But the reason why this herb is mentioned is its bitterness, — and not its wholesome effects. It was hence chosen to designate what is afflictive and distressing. This appears from. <span class="bvs">Pro_5:4</span>, “bitter as wormwood.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(250)</strong> See note on <span class="bvs">Jer_8:14</span>. </p></div>
