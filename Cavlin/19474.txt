<div class="comment-content"><p>Hence, the Prophet says now, <em>He shall be buried with the burial of an ass </em>He mentions the ass because it is a mean animal; he might have named a horse or an ox, but as the ass is a meaner and more contemptible animal, it is the same thing as though he had said, “Jehoiakim shall be cast away with the dogs.” This prophecy no doubt grievously wounded not only the mind of the king himself, but also that of the whole people; for as yet his throne stood, and all highly regarded the family of David, and thought the kingdom sacred, as it was under the guardianship and protection of God. But the Prophet hesitated not to denounce what was afterwards confirmed by the event; for Jehoiakim was buried with the burial of an ass, as he was cast forth far beyond the gates of Jerusalem. Here the Prophet amplifies the disgrace by which the King Jehoiakim would be branded, for he might have been left dead in a journey; but he expresses what is more grievous than the casting forth; <em>Drawn out, </em>he says, and <em>cast forth, </em>etc.; that is, Jehoiakim shall not only be cast forth, but also drawn as an ass or a dog, lest his foetor should infect the city; as though he was unworthy not only of a grave, but also of being seen by men. <span class="cite-ref">(58)</span></p><p>And this is to be especially noticed, for we hence conclude how great his perverseness was in despising the threatenings of God, since the Prophet could not otherwise storm the mind of the king, and terrify the people, than by exaggerating the indignity that was to happen to him. For if there had been any teachable spirit in the king and the people, the Prophet would have been content with making a simple statement, “Jehoiakim shall not be buried;” that is, God will punish him even when dead; the curse of God will not only be upon him while living, but he will also take vengeance on him after his death. He was not content with this kind of statement; but <em>he shall be buried, </em>he says, as an ass, and <em>shall be cast far off; </em>and further still, his carcass shall <em>be drawn </em>or dragged; so that it was to be an eternal mark of infamy and disgrace. </p><p><strong>(58)</strong> The verb, or rather participle, rendered “drawn,” means to be dragged along, and not carried. See <span class="bvs">2Sa_17:13</span>. He was to be dragged out of the city and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem. It is said in <span class="bvs">2Ch_36:6</span>, that Nebuchadnezzar “bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.” The probability is (for we have no express account) that he died while in fetters at Jerusalem, before he was removed, and that Nebuchadnezzar, from indignation at his rebellion, had him dragged as a dead ass out of the city and exposed as food for rapacious birds and beasts. We find it said in <span class="bvs">2Kg_24:6</span>, that “Jehoiakim slept with his fathers;” but this only means that he died, or that he died a natural death and was not killed; for we find this phrase used, when burial is afterwards mentioned. See <span class="bvs">2Ch_12:16</span>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
