<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>And if any man thinketh </em>That man <em>thinketh that he knoweth something</em>, who is delighted with the opinion that he entertains of his own knowledge, and despises others, as if he were far above them. For Paul does not here condemn knowledge, but that ambition and haughtiness which ungodly men contract in consequence of it. Otherwise he does not exhort us to be sceptical, so as to be always hesitating and hanging in doubt, and he does not approve of a false and counterfeit modesty, as if it were a good thing to think that we are ignorant of what we do know. That man, therefore, who <em>thinketh that he knoweth something</em>, or, in other words, who is insolent from an empty notion of his own knowledge, so that he prefers himself before others, and is self-conceited, <em>he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know </em>For the beginning of all true knowledge is acquaintance with God, which produces in us humility and submission; nay more, it prostrates us entirely instead of elating us. But where pride is, <em>there </em>is ignorance of God <span class="cite-ref">(462)</span> — a beautiful passage! Would to God that all knew it aright, so as properly to understand the rule of right knowledge! </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(462)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La regne ignorance et faute de cognoissance de Dieu</span>;” — “There ignorance reigns, and deficiency in acquaintance with God.” </p></div></div>
