<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And when there had been great disputation. </em>Though there were choice made of grave men, and such as were public teachers of the Church, yet could not they agree by and by.<span class="cite-ref">(93)</span> Whereby appeareth how the Lord did exercise his Church, even then, by the infirmity of men, that it might learn to be wise with humility. Moreover, he suffered (even in that company and assembly wherein he was chief) the principal point of Christian doctrine to be diversely tossed and handled, lest we should wonder, if at any time it so fall out, that men, who are otherwise learned and godly, do, through unskillfulness, fall into an error. For some were not so quick witted [acute] that they could thoroughly see into the greatness of the matter. So that when they judge that the law ought to be kept, being unadvisedly carried away with the zeal of the law, they see not into how deep a labyrinth they throw the consciences of other men, and their own also. They thought that circumcision was an eternal and inviolable token of God’s covenant; the same opinion had they of all the whole law. Wherefore Peter standeth chiefly upon this, to show the state of the question, which the most of them knew not. And his oration hath two members. For, first, he proveth by the authority of God that the Gentiles must not be enforced to keep the law; secondly, he teacheth that all man’s salvation is overthrown, if the conscience be once caught in this snare. Therefore, the former part (wherein he declareth that he was sent of God to teach the Gentiles, and that the Holy Spirit came down upon them) tendeth to this end, that men did not unadvisedly disannul the ceremonies of the law, but that God is the author of that disannulling. And so soon as the authority of God is brought forth, all doubting is taken away, because this is all our wisdom, to stay ourselves upon the authority, government, and commandment of God,<span class="cite-ref">(94)</span> and to make more account of his beck and pleasure than of all reasons. Now, it is meet that we ponder the words of Peter, whereby he proveth that this was granted to the Gentiles by God, to be free from the yoke of the law.</p><p><em>You know. </em>He calleth them to bear witness, (and unto them he appealeth,) lest any man should think that he is about to speak of some dark and doubtful thing. The history was well known to them all. That which remained, he showeth that they were blind even in most clear light, yea, because they had not long ago learned that which was openly showed. He calleth the beginning of the preaching of the gospel old days, or the old time, as if he should say, ago, as it were since the first beginning of the Church, after that Christ began to gather to himself any people.</p><p><em>God did choose in us. </em>The word <em>choose </em>doth signify to appoint or decree. Though Peter doth comprehend as well the free election of God as the choice whereby God did adopt the Gentiles to be his people; therefore, he chose, that is, as it were, making choice, that he might show a token of his free election in the Gentiles, he would that by my mouth they should hear the doctrine of the gospel. These words, <em>in us, </em>do import as much as in our sight, or we being witnesses, or among us.<span class="cite-ref">(95)</span> For his meaning is, that he declareth nothing but that which they knew full well; to wit, which was done before their eyes. The phrase is common enough both among the Grecians, and also among the Hebretians, [Hebrews,] unless we had liefer resolve it as some other do, He hath chosen me out of this company.</p><p><em>And believe. </em>This was a seal to confirm the calling of the Gentiles. The office of teaching was enjoined Peter by an oracle; but the fruit which came of his doctrine doth make his ministry noble and authentical, as they call it. For, seeing that the elect are illuminate into the faith by a peculiar grace of the Spirit, doctrine shall bring forth no fruit, unless the Lord show forth his power in his ministers, in teaching the minds of those inwardly which hear, and in drawing their hearts inwardly. Therefore, seeing the Lord commanded that the doctrine of the gospel should be brought unto the Gentiles, he did sanctify them to himself, that they might be no longer profane. But the solemn consecration was then perfect in all points, when he imprinted in their hearts, by faith, the mark of their adoption. The sentence which followeth immediately is to be understood as set down by way of exposition;<span class="cite-ref">(96)</span> for Peter annexeth the visible graces of the Spirit unto faith, as, assuredly, they were nothing else but an addition thereof. Therefore, seeing that the Gentiles are ingrafted into the people of God without circumcision and ceremonies, Peter gathereth that it was not well done to lay upon them any necessity to keep the law. Yet it seemeth to be but a weak argument to prove their election withal, because the Holy Ghost came down upon them. For they were such gifts that they could not reason from the same, that they were reckoned in the number of the godly. But it is the Spirit of regeneration alone which distinguisheth the children of God from strangers. I answer, Though men, who were otherwise vain, were endued with the gift of tongues and such like, yet doth Peter take for a thing which all men grant, that which was known, that God had sealed in Cornelius and his cousins [relatives] his free adoption by the visible grace of the Spirit, as if he should point out his children with his finger.</p><p><em>The knower of the hearts. </em>He applieth this adjunct to God, according to the circumstance of the present matter; and it hath under it a secret contrariety,<span class="cite-ref">(97)</span> that men are more addicted to external purity, because they judge according to their gross and earthly sense and understanding; but God doth look into the heart. Therefore, Peter teacheth that they judge preposterously in this matter according to man’s understanding, seeing that the inward pureness of the heart alone is here to be esteemed, which we know not.<span class="cite-ref">(98)</span> And by this means doth he bridle our rashness, lest, taking to ourselves more than we ought, we murmur against the judgment of God. As if he should say, if thou see no reason of that testimony which God gave them, think with thyself what great difference there is between him and thee. For thou art holden with external pomp according to thy gross nature, which must be abandoned when we come to the throne of God,<span class="cite-ref">(99)</span> where the hearts of men are known spiritually. But, in the mean season, we must note a general doctrine, that the eyes of God do not look upon the vain pomp of men,<span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> but upon the integrity of men’s hearts, as it is written, ( <span class="bvs">Jer_5:3</span>.) Whereas the old interpreter and Erasmus translate it, that God knoweth the hearts, it doth not sufficiently express that which Luke saith in Greek; for when he calleth God <span class="lang el-gr">καρδιαγνωστην</span>, he setteth him against<span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> men, who judge rather for the most part by the outward appearance; and therefore they may be <span class="lang el-gr">προσωπογνωσται</span>, or <em>knowers of the face, </em>if they be compared with God.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(93)</span></p><p>“ Ne inter eos quidem statim convenire potuit,” not even could they come instantly to an agreement. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(94)</span></p><p>“ Dei imperio acquiescere,” to aequiesce in the command of God. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(95)</span></p><p>“ In medio nostri,” in the midst of us. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(96)</span></p><p>“ Exegetice,” exegetically. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(97)</span></p><p>“ Tacita antithesis,” a tacit antithesis. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(98)</span></p><p>“ Quae nobis occulta est,” which is hidden from us. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(99)</span></p><p>“ Ad coeleste tribunal,” to the heavenly tribunal. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(100)</span></p><p>“ Operum,” of works. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span></p><p>“ Eum opponit,” he opposes him to, or contrasts him with. </p></div></div>
