<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>82</strong><em>My eyes have waxed dim in looking for thy word </em>This verse is very similar to the preceding, — transforming to the eyes what had been said before concerning the soul. The only difference is, that, instead of <em>longing after salvation </em>or <em>help, </em>the expression, <em>longing after God’s word compromise, </em>is here used; for <em>salvation </em>is an act, as it is termed; that is to say, it consists in effect, whereas <em>a promise </em>keeps us suspended in expectation. God may not, all at once, openly perform what he has promised; and, in this case, it being only in his word that he promises us help, there is no other way by which we can hope for help, than by our reposing on his word. As, then, the word precedes, in order, the help which God affords, or, rather, as it is the manner in which it is represented to our view, the prophet, when sighing after salvation, very properly declares that he kept his eyes fixed on the Divine word, until his sight failed him. Here we have presented to us the wonderful and incredible power of patience, under the infirmity of the flesh, when, being faint and deprived of all rigor, we have recourse to God for help, even while it is hidden from us. In short, the prophet, to prevent it from being supposed that he was too effeminate and faint-hearted, intimates that his fainting was not without cause. In asking God, <em>When wilt thou comfort me? </em>he shows, with sufficient plainness, that he was for a long time, as it were, cast off and forsaken. </p></div>
