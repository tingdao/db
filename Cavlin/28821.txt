<div class="comment-content"><p>God, indeed, is always true and steadfast in his promises, and has always his <em>Amen, </em>as often as he speaks. But as for us, such is our vanity, that we do not utter our Amen in return, except when he gives a sure testimony in our hearts by his word. This he does by his Spirit. That is what Paul means here. He had previously taught, that this is a befitting harmony — when, on the one hand, <em>the calling of God is without repentance, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_11:29</span>,) and we, in our turn, with an unwavering faith, accept of the blessing of adoption that is held out to us. That God remains steadfast to his promise is not surprising; but to keep pace with God in the steadfastness of our faith in return — <em>that </em>truly is not in man’s power. <span class="cite-ref">(294)</span> He teaches us, also, that God cures our weakness or defect, (as they term it,) when, by correcting our belief, he confirms us by his Spirit. Thus it comes, that we glorify him by a firm steadfastness of faith. He associates himself, however, with the Corinthians, expressly for the purpose of conciliating their affections the better, with a view to the cultivation of unity. <span class="cite-ref">(295)</span></p><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Who hath anointed us. </em>He employs different terms to express one and the same thing. For along with <em>confirmation, </em>he employs the terms <em>anointing </em>and <em>sealing, </em>or, by this twofold metaphor, <span class="cite-ref">(296)</span> he explains more distinctly what he had previously stated without a figure. For God, by pouring down upon us the heavenly grace of the Spirit, does, in this manner, <em>seal </em>upon our hearts the certainty of his own word. He then introduces a <em>fourth </em>idea — that the Spirit has been given to us as an <em>earnest </em>— a similitude which he frequently makes use of, and is also exceedingly appropriate. <span class="cite-ref">(297)</span> For as the Spirit, in bearing witness of our adoption, is our security, and, by confirming the faith of the promises, is the <em>seal </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">σφραγὶς)</span>, so it is on good grounds that he is called an <em>earnest, </em><span class="cite-ref">(298)</span> because it is owing to him, that the covenant of God is ratified on both sides, which would, but for this, have hung in suspense. <span class="cite-ref">(299)</span></p><p>Here we must notice, in the <em>first </em>place, the relation <span class="cite-ref">(300)</span> which Paul requires between the gospel of God and our faith; for as every thing that God says is more than merely certain, so he wishes that this should be established in our minds by a firm and sure assent. <em>Secondly, </em>we must observe that, as an assurance of this nature is a thing that is above the capacity of the human mind, it is the part of the Holy Spirit to confirm within us what God promises in his word. Hence it is that he has those titles of distinction — the <em>Anointing, </em>the <em>Earnest, </em>the <em>Comforter, </em>and the <em>Seal. </em>In the <em>third </em>place we must observe, that all that have not the Holy Spirit as a witness, so as to return their <em>Amen </em>to God, when calling them to an assured hope of salvation, do on false grounds assume the name of Christians. </p><p><strong>(294)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’apporter de nostre costé vne correspondance mutuelle à la vocation de Dieu en perseuerant constamment en la foy</span>;” — “To maintain on our part a mutual correspondence to the call of God by persevering steadfastly in the faith.” </p><p><strong>(295)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Expressement afin de les gaigner et attirer a vraye vnite</span>;” — “Expressly for the purpose of gaining them over and drawing to a true unity.” </p><p><strong>(296)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par les deux mots qui sont dits par metaphore et similitude</span>;” — “By these two words which are employed by way of metaphor and similitude.” </p><p><strong>(297)</strong> “<span class="lang el-gr">Αῤρ᾿αβὡν</span> and the Latin <em>arrhabo </em> are derived from the Hebrew <span class="lang he-il">ערבון</span> (<em>gnarabon</em>) — a pledge or earnest; <em>i.e.</em>, a part of any price agreed on, and <em>paid down </em>to ratify the engagement; German, <em>Hand </em>— <em>gift</em>. ” — <em>Bloomfield</em>. “The word appears to have passed, probably as a commercial term, out of the Hebrew or Phenician into the western languages.” — <em>Gesenius</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(298)</strong> “If God having once given this <em>earnest</em>, should not also give the rest of the inheritance, he should undergoe the losse of his earnest, as Chrysostome most elegantly and soundly argueth.” — <em>Leigh’s </em>Annotations. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(299)</strong> “A <em>seal </em>was used for different purposes: to mark a person’s property, to secure his treasures, or to authenticate a deed.

[...] An <em>earnest </em>is a part given as a security for the future possession of the whole.
