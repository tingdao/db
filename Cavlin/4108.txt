<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>But the men that went up with him said. </em>We here see, as in a mirror, how impiety gradually gathers audaciousness in evil. At the outset, the authors of the rebellion were ambiguous in their expressions, and contented themselves with obscure insinuations; they now throw aside all shame, and openly and acrimoniously oppose the address of Caleb, which was certainly nothing less than casting discredit on God’s words, and setting at naught His power. God had promised to give the land to the Israelites; they deny that He will do so. He had afforded them many proofs that nothing is difficult to Him: they deny that His aid will suffice against the forces of their enemies. Moreover, they at length break out into such impudence, that in their falsehood they contradict themselves. They had confessed that the land was rich; they now declare that it consumes or devours its inhabitants, which is entirely the reverse. For this is equivalent to saying, that the wretched men, who cultivated it, wore themselves out with their assiduous labors; or, at ally rate, that it was pestilential from the inclemency of its climate; either of which statements was utterly false. The mode in which some understand it, viz., that the giants <span class="cite-ref">(52)</span> in their violence committed indiscriminate slaughter, is without foundation; for this evil was by no means to be feared by the people, after the extermination of the inhabitants. I do not doubt, then, but that it means that the cultivation of the land was difficult, and full of much inconvenience. </p><p>At the end of the last verse, where it is said, “as grasshoppers,” etc., I think the words are inverted, and ought to be thus connected; “As grasshoppers are despised in our eyes, so we were looked down upon by these giants on account of our lowness of stature.” </p><p><strong>(52)</strong> Corn. a Lapide has the following note on verse 33; “<span class="lang he-il">נפלים</span>, <em>nephilim, i.e., </em>giants, who are called <em>nephilim, </em>that is, <em>falling, </em>because they were so tall, that those who saw them fell from terror, or rather <em>falling, i.e., </em>making to fall, (the <em>Kal </em>being put for the <em>Hiphil</em>,) laying prostrate and slaying other men in all directions, for these giants were savage men and truculent tyrants.” </p></div>
