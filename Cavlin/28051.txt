<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Patience, probation</em>, <em>etc. </em>James, adopting a similar gradation, seems to follow a different order; for he says, that patience proceeds from probation: but the different meaning of the word is what will reconcile both. Paul takes probation for the experience which the faithful have of the sure protection of God, when by relying on his aid they overcome all difficulties, even when they experience, whilst in patiently enduring they stand firm, how much avails the power of the Lord, which he has promised to be always present with his people. James takes the same word for tribulation itself, according to the common usage of Scripture; for by these God proves and tries his servants: and they are often called trials. <span class="cite-ref">(155)</span></p><p>According then to the present passage, we then only make advances in patience as we ought, when we regard it as having been continued to us by God’s power, and thus entertain hope as to the future, that God’s favor, which has ever succored us in our necessities, will never be wanting to us. Hence he subjoins, that from probation arises hope; for ungrateful we should be for benefits received, except the recollection of them confirms our hope as to what is to come. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(155)</span> The word in James is<span class="lang el-gr">δοκίμιον </span> while here it is <span class="lang el-gr">δοκιμὴ. </span> The first means a test, or the act of testing — trial; and the second, the result of testing — experience, and is rendered in our version “proof,” <span class="bvs">2Co_2:9</span>, — “experiment,” <span class="bvs">2Co_9:13</span>, — and in <span class="bvs">2Co_8:2</span>, “trial,” which ought to be experience. [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] says, that the first bears to the second a similar relation as cause bears to effect: the one thing is testing or probation, and the other is the experience that is thereby gained. </p><p>The word is rendered here, not very intelligibly, “approbation,” both by [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] <em>; </em>but more correctly, “experience,” by [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>]. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
