<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>This wisdom descendeth not</em>. As hypocrites with difficulty give way, he sharply checked their haughtiness, denying that to be true wisdom with which they were inflated, while they were extremely morose in searching out the vices of others. Conceding to them, however, the term <em>wisdom</em>, he shews by the words he applies to it its true character, and says that it is <em>earthly, sensual, devilish</em>, or demoniac, while true wisdom must be heavenly, spiritual, divine; which three things are directly contrary to the three preceding ones. For James takes it as granted, that we are not wise, except when we are illuminated by God from above through his Spirit. However, then, the mind of man may enlarge itself, all its acuteness will be vanity; and not only so, but being at length entangled in the wiles of Satan, it will become wholly delirious. <span class="cite-ref">(126)</span></p><p><em>Sensual</em>, or <em>animal</em>, is in opposition to what is spiritual, as in <span class="bvs">1Co_2:14</span>, where Paul says that the sensual or animal man receives not the things of God. And the pride of man could not have been more effectually cast down, than when thus is condemned whatever wisdom he has from himself, without the Spirit of God; nay, when from himself a transition is made to the devil. For it is the same as though he had said, that men, following their own sense, or minds, or feelings, soon became a prey to the delusions of Satan. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(126)</span><em>Scott </em>considers that this wisdom was called “earthly,” because it sought earthly distinctions, and was of earthly origin, — “sensual,” or rather “natural,” as the word is rendered in <span class="bvs">1Co_2:14</span>, because it was the result of such principles as <em>natural </em>men are actuated by, such as envy and ambition, — “and devilish,” because it came first from the devil, and constituted the image of his pride, ambition, malignity, and falsehood. </p><p>The word “sensual” has led some to suppose that the reference is to sensuality, the gratification of carnal lusts: but there is nothing in the passage that favors this view. The only things mentioned are envy and a contentious spirit, things which belong to natural man. </p></div></div>
