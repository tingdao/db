Since they are subjects, they may afflict them with burdens, to depress them; and this slavery will weaken and decrease them. But their power over them as subjects should not have been carried so far as to impose upon inoffensive persons, to whom they had granted free permission to reside among them, these new tributes; for they ought first to have considered upon what conditions they had been admitted. The exaction, then, by which Pharaoh broke faith with them, was in itself unjust; but the crime to which he proceeded was still greater, because he did not simply seek for pecuniary advantage, but desired to afflict the wretched people by the heaviness of their burdens. For the Israelites were not only compelled to pay tribute, but were put to servile labor, as Moses immediately adds.

For it is clear from many passages (<span class="bvs">Gen_47:11</span>; <span class="bvs">Exo_12:37</span>; <span class="bvs">Num_33:3</span>) that Rhameses was situated in that part of the country, and we shall presently see that the children of Israel went out from Rhameses. </p><p><strong>(15)</strong><span class="lang he-il">מסכנות</span>, <em>miscenoth </em>The LXX. alone gives some countenance to <em>C</em>. ’s last interpretation of this word, by rendering it <span class="lang el-gr">πόλεις ὀχυρὰς</span>. — <em>W </em></p></div>
