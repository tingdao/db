<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>56.</strong><em>And they tempted and provoked the Most High God. </em>Here they are upbraided for having, notwithstanding the many tokens of the divine favor by which they were distinguished, persevered in acting perfidiously: yea, even although God from time to time conferred upon them new benefits, to recover them to their allegiance to him, they, notwithstanding, by their rebellion, shook off his yoke. With respect to the word <em>tempt, </em>we have already explained its import. But it is added in general, that <em>they provoked God, because they had not kept his covenant </em>By this last clause, their open and gross rebellion is the more completely demonstrated; for, although they had been plainly taught their duty, they nevertheless refused to submit to the authority of God. The law is called <em>testimonies </em>or <em>agreements, </em><span class="cite-ref">(357)</span> because, as men enter into contracts upon certain conditions, so God, by his covenant, entered into a contract with this people, and bound them to himself. In speaking of them in this manner, there is pronounced upon them no light censure; but when they are charged in the next verse with apostasy and perfidiousness, that fills up the measure of their guilt. God had adopted them to be his people: they, on the other hand, despising his favor, voluntarily renounce it. He had gathered them together under his wings; and they, by their waywardness, scatter themselves in all directions. He had promised to be a father to them; and they refuse to be his children. He had shown them the way of salvation; and they, by going astray, willingly precipitate themselves into destruction. The prophet, therefore, concludes, that in every age they showed themselves to be an impious and wicked people. It is again to be noticed, that the fault which is most severely condemned in them is, that they too much resembled their fathers. This is particularly mentioned, to prevent any man from deceiving himself by supposing, that in indiscriminately imitating his ancestors he is doing right, and that he may not think of making use of their example as an argument for defending his own conduct. The instability of the people is next expressed by a very apposite figure, which Hosea also employs in <span class="bvs">Hos_7:16</span>. As archers are deceived when they have a bow which is too weak, or ill bent, or crooked and flexible, so it is stated, that this people <em>turned back, </em>and slipped away by their deceitful and tortuous craftiness, that they might not be governed by the hand of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(357)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ou, Convenances</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
