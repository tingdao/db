<div class="comment-content"><p>He afterwards adds, <em>They shall lick the dust as a serpent </em>He intimates, that however the enemies of the Church may have proudly exalted themselves before, they shall then be cast down, and lie, as it were, on the ground; for to lick the dust is nothing else but to lie prostrate on the earth. They shall then be low and creeping like serpents; and then, <em>They shall move themselves as worms and reptiles of the ground </em>The verb <span class="lang he-il">רגז</span>, <em>regez, </em>as it has been stated elsewhere, means to raise an uproar, to tumultuate, and it means also to move one’s self; and this latter meaning is the most suitable here, namely, that they shall go forth or move themselves from their enclosures; for the word <span class="lang he-il">סגר</span>, <em>sager, </em>signifies to close up: and by enclosures he means hiding-places, though in the song of David, in <span class="bvs">Psa_18:0</span> :, the word is applied to citadels and other fortified places, — </p><p>‘Men,’ he says, ‘trembled from their fortresses;’ </p><p>though they occupied well-fortified citadels, they yet were afraid, because the very fame of David had broken down their boldness. But as the Prophet speaks here of worms, I prefer this rendering, — ‘from their lurkingplaces;’ as though he said, “Though they have hitherto thought themselves safe in their enclosures, they shall yet move and flee away like worms and reptiles; for when the ground is dug, the worms immediately leap out, for they think that they are going to be taken; so also, when any one moves the ground, the reptiles come forth, and tremblingly run away in all directions.” And the Prophet says that, in like manner, the enemies of the Church, when the Lord shall arise for its help, shall be smitten with so much fear, that they shall in every direction run away. And this comparison ought to be carefully noticed, that is, when the Prophet compares powerful nations well exercised in wars, who before were audaciously raging, and were swollen with great pride — when he compares them to worms and reptiles of the ground, and also to serpents: he did this to show, that there will be nothing to hinder God from laying prostrate every exalted thing in the world, as soon as it shall please him to aid his Church. </p><p>And hence the Prophet adds, <em>On account of Jehovah our God they shall treed, and they shall fear because of thee </em>Here the Prophet shows, that the faithful ought not to distrust on account of their own weakness, but, on the contrary, to remember the infinite power of God. It is indeed right that the children of God should begin with diffidence, — sensible that they are nothing, and that all their strength is nothing; but they ought not to stop at their own weakness, but, on the contrary, to rise up to the contemplation of God’s power, that they may not doubt but that, when his power shall appear, their enemies shall be soon scattered. This is the reason why the Prophet here mentions the name of God, and then turns to address God himself. <em>Tremble </em>then<em>shall they at Jehovah our God, </em>that is, on account of Jehovah our God; and then <em>Fear shall they because of thee. </em><span class="cite-ref">(200)</span> It now follows — </p><p><strong>(200)</strong><em>Dathius </em>renders these two lines differently, “Jovam Deum nostrum timebunt eumque reverebuntur — Jehovah our God they shall fear, and him will they reverence.” But this is neither consistent with the passage, nor with the form in which the words appear. <span class="lang he-il">פחד</span> is not commonly, if ever, a transitive verb, and to dread, or to be afraid, and not to fear, is its usual meaning: and <span class="lang he-il">ירא</span>, when it means the fear of reverence, is generally construed without a preposition, and with <span class="lang he-il">את</span> before Jehovah. The literal rendering is no doubt that which is given by Calvin. The distich is capable of being rendered in <em>Welsh </em>exactly as in Hebrew, in the same form and with the same prepositions; and, when thus rendered, the meaning is what is give here, — </p><p>(lang. cy) <em>Oherwydd Jehova ein Duw ur arswydant, </em>—<em><LineBreak /></em><em>Ac ovnant rhagddot </em></p><p>To fear because of thee, and to fear thee, are two distinct things. You will have the first form in <span class="bvs">Jos_10:8</span>; and the second in <span class="bvs">Deu_31:12</span>. The first refers to the fear of the Canaanites, the dread of their power; the second, to the fear of Jehovah. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
