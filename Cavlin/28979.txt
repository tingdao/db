<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>For though I should boast more largely of my authority</em>. It was a sign of modesty, that he put himself into the number of those, whom he greatly excelled. At the same time, he was not disposed to show such modesty, as not to retain his authority unimpaired. He accordingly adds, that he has said less than his authority entitled him to say; for he was not one of the ordinary class of ministers, but was even distinguished among the Apostles. Hence he says: “Though I should boast more, <em>I should not be ashamed</em>, for there will be good ground for it.” He anticipates an objection, because he does not fail to speak of his own glory, while at the same time he refrains from making farther mention of it, that the Corinthians may understand, that, if he boasts, it is against his will, as in truth the false Apostles constrained him to it; otherwise he would not have done so. </p><p>By the term <em>power </em>he means — the authority of his Apostleship, which he had among the Corinthians for, through all the ministers of the word have the same office in common, there are nevertheless, degrees of honor. Now God had placed Paul on a higher eminence than others, inasmuch as he had made use of his endeavors for founding <span class="cite-ref">(767)</span> that Church, and had in many ways put honor upon his Apostleship. Lest, however, malevolent persons should stir up odium against him, on the ground of his making use of the term <em>power</em>, he adds the purpose for which it was given him — the salvation of the Corinthians. Hence it follows, that it ought not to be irksome to them, or grievous, for who would not bear patiently, nay more, who would not love what he knows to be of advantage to him? In the mean time, there is an implied contrast between his power, and that in which the false apostles gloried — which was of such a nature that the Corinthians received no advantage from it, and experienced no edification. There can, however, be no doubt, that all the ministers of the word are also, furnished with <em>power</em>; for of what sort were a preaching of the word, that was without <em>power </em>? Hence it is said to all — </p><p>He that heareth you, heareth me;<LineBreak />he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me. (<span class="bvs">Luk_10:16</span>.) </p><p>As however, many, on false grounds, claim for themselves what they have not, we must carefully observe, how far Paul extends his <em>power </em>— so as to be to the edification of believers. Those, then, who exercise <em>power </em>in the way of destroying the Church, prove themselves to be tyrants, and robbers — not pastors. In the <em>second </em>place, we must observe, that he declares, that it was given to him by God. He, therefore, that is desirous to have any thing in his power to do, must have God as the Author of his power. Others, it is true, will boast of this also, as the Pope with full mouth thunders forth, that he is Christ’s vicar. But what evidence does he give of this? <span class="cite-ref">(768)</span> For Christ has not conferred <em>power </em>of this kind upon dumb persons, but upon the Apostles, and his other ministers, that the doctrine of his Gospel might not be without defense. Hence the whole <em>power </em>of ministers is included in the word — but in such a way, nevertheless, that Christ may always remain Lord and Master. Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that in lawful authority these two things are required — that it be given by God, and that it be exercised for the welfare of the Church. It is well known, who they are, on whom God has conferred this <em>power</em>, and in what way he has limited the power he has given. Those exercise it in a proper manner, who faithfully obey his commandment. </p><p>Here, however, a question may be proposed. “God says to Jeremiah, </p><p>Behold, I set thee over the nations, and kingdoms, <LineBreak />to plant, and to pluck up, to build and to destroy.<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Jer_1:10</span>.) </p><p>We have, also, found it stated a little before, (<span class="bvs">2Co_10:5</span>) that the Apostles were set apart on the same footing — that they might destroy every thing that exalted itself against Christ. Nay more, the teachers of the gospel cannot build up in any other way, than by destroying the old man. Besides, they preach the gospel to the condemnation and destruction of the wicked.” I answer that, what Paul says here, has nothing to do with the wicked, for he addresses the Corinthians, to whom he wished his Apostleship to be beneficial. With regard to them, I say, he could do nothing but with a view to edification. We have already observed, also, that this was expressly stated, that the Corinthians might know, that the authority of this holy man was not assailed by any one but Satan, the enemy of their salvation, while the design of that authority was their edification. </p><p>At the same time, it is in other respects true in a general way, that the doctrine of the gospel has in its own nature a tendency to <em>edification </em>— not to <em>destruction</em>. For as to its destroying, that comes from something apart from itself — from the fault of mankind, while they stumble at the stone that was appointed form as a <em>foundation </em>(<span class="bvs">1Pe_2:8</span>.) As to the fact, that we are renewed after the image of God by the destruction of the old man — that is not at all at variance with Paul’s words, for in that case destruction is taken in a good sense, but here in a bad sense, as meaning the ruin of what is God’s, or as meaning the destruction of the soul — as if he had said, that his <em>power </em>was not injurious to them, for instead of this the advantage of it for their salvation was manifested. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(767)</span> "<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour fonder et batir</span>;" — "For founding and building up." </p><p><span class="cite-note">(768)</span> "<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais que fait-il?
