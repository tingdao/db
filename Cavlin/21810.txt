<div class="comment-content"><p>I do not know the derivation of the word “<em>Satra </em>p;” but manifestly all these are names of magistracies, and I allow myself to translate the words freely, since they are not Hebrew, and the Jews are equally ignorant of their origin. Some of them, indeed, appear too subtle; but they assert nothing but what is frivolous and foolish. We must be content with the simple expression — <em>he sent to collect the satraps </em></p></div>
