Hence the Prophet, to shew that their offenses had not been slight, but that they had been extremely wicked before God, says that the whole of God’s wrath had been executed: <em>Jehovah has completed his wrath </em>The expression is indeed harsh to Latin ears; but the meaning is, that he had executed his extreme judgment. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>He has poured forth the indignation of his wrath</em>.
