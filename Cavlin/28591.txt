<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Let no one seek his own. </em>He handles the same subject in the 14<span class="cite-ref">th</span> Chapter of the Romans. <em>Let no one please himself</em>, <em>but endeavor to please his brethren for their edification </em>This is a precept that is very necessary, for we are so corrupted by nature, that every one consults his own interests, regardless of those of his brethren. Now, as the law of love calls upon us to <em>love our neighbors as ourselves</em>, (<span class="bvs">Mat_22:39</span>,) so it requires us to consult their welfare. The Apostle, however, does not expressly forbid individuals to consult their own advantage, but he requires that they should not be so devoted to their own interests, as not to be prepared to forego part of their right, as often as the welfare of their brethren requires this. </p></div>
