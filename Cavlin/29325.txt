<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Submit yourselves. </em>God has bound us so strongly to each other, that no man ought to endeavor to avoid subjection; and where love reigns, mutual services will be rendered. I do not except even kings and governors, whose very authority is held for the <em>service </em>of the community. It is highly proper that all should be exhorted to be subject to each other in their turn. </p><p>But as nothing is more irksome to the mind of man than this mutual subjection, he directs us to <em>the fear of Christ, </em>who alone can subdue our fierceness, that we may not refuse the yoke, and can humble our pride, that we may not be ashamed of serving our neighbors. It does not much affect the sense, whether we interpret <em>the fear of Christ, </em>passively, thus, — let us submit to our neighbors, because we fear Christ; or actively, — let us submit to them, because the minds of all godly persons ought to be influenced by such fear under the reign of Christ. Some Greek manuscripts read, “the fear <em>of God. </em>” The change may have been introduced by some person, who thought that the other phrase, <em>the fear of Christ, </em>though by far the most appropriate, sounded a little harsh. <span class="cite-ref">(164)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(164)</span> “Here, indeed, there is great reason to think that <span class="lang el-gr">Χριστοῦ</span>, (instead of <span class="lang el-gr">Θεοῦ</span>,) found in very many of the best MSS., ancient Versions, and early Fathers, (and which has been edited by Griesbach, Vater, Tittmann, and Scholz,) is the true reading.” — Bloomfield. </p></div></div>
