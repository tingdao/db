<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Through faith he kept the Passover, etc. </em>This ought to have availed much to commend faith to the Jews; for they held this first sacrifice of the Passover in the highest esteem. But, he says, that it was kept by faith, not because the Paschal lamb was a type of Christ, but because its benefit did not appear, when he sprinkled the doorposts with blood: when therefore the effect was yet hid, it was necessarily looked for by faith. Nay, it might have seemed strange, that Moses should set a few drops of blood, as a remedy, in opposition to God’s vengeance; but being satisfied with God’s word alone, that the people would be exempt from the scourge that was coming on the Egyptians, he did not hesitate. Hence the Apostle justly commends his faith in this respect. </p><p>They who explain that the Passover was by faith celebrated by Moses, because he had respect to Christ, say indeed what is true; but the Apostle here records simply his faith, because he acquiesced in God’s word alone, when the effect did not appear: therefore out of place here are philosophical refinements. And the reason why he mentions Moses alone, as celebrating the Passover, seems to be this, that God through him instituted the Passover. <span class="cite-ref">(233)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(233)</span> Some render the words, “by faith he instituted the Passover.” The verb is properly to make, but like <span class="lang he-il">עשה</span> in Hebrew, it is used in a variety of senses. Doddridge has “celebrated;” Macknight, “appointed;” and Stuart, “observed.” To make the Passover is, no doubt, to keep or observe it; for such is the meaning of the phrase, as it appears from <span class="bvs">Num_9:10</span>. The word<span class="lang el-gr">πάσχα </span> is doubtless a Syriac term, and derived originally from the Hebrew <span class="lang he-il">פסה</span> which means to pass over; though several of the Greek fathers derived it from<span class="lang el-gr">πάσχειν, </span> to suffer. It sometimes means the paschal feast, <span class="bvs">Luk_22:11</span>, and sometimes the paschal Lamb, <span class="bvs">Mar_14:12</span>; <span class="bvs">1Co_5:7</span> — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
