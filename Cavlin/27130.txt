<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong>Whereas he saith that Jacob came into Egypt with seventy-five souls, it agreeth not with the words of Moses; for Moses maketh mention of seventy only. Jerome thinketh that Luke setteth not down, word for word, those things which Stephen had spoken, or that he took this number out of the Greek translation of Moses, (<span class="bvs">Gen_46:27</span>,) either because he himself, being a proselyte, had not the knowledge of the Hebrew tongue, or because he would grant the Gentiles this, who used to read it thus. <span class="cite-ref">(400)</span> Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the Greek interpreters set down this number of set purpose, or whether it crop [crept] in afterward through negligence, [mistake;] which (I mean the latter) might well be, forasmuch as the Grecians used to set down their numbers in letters. Augustine, in his 26<span class="cite-ref">th</span> book of City of God, <em>[De Civitate Dei,] </em>thinketh that Joseph’s nephews and kinsmen <span class="cite-ref">(401)</span> are comprehended in this number; and so he thinketh that the words <em>went down </em>doth signify all that time which Jacob lived. But that conjecture can by no means be received. For, in the mean space, the other patriarchs also had many children born to them. This seemeth to me a thing like to be true, that the Seventy Interpreters did translate that truly which was in Moses. And we cannot say that they were deceived; forasmuch as [in] <span class="bvs">Deu_10:0</span>, where this number is repeated, they agree with Moses, at least as that place was read without all doubt in the time of Jerome; for those copies which are printed at this day have it otherwise. Therefore, I think that this difference came through the error of the writers which wrote out the books. <span class="cite-ref">(402)</span> And it was a matter of no such weight, for which Luke ought to have troubled the Gentiles which were accustomed with the Greek reading. And it may be that he himself did put down the true number; and that some man did correct the same amiss out of that place of Moses. For we know that those which had the New Testament in hand were ignorant of the Hebrew tongue, yet skillful in <span class="cite-ref">(403)</span> the Greek, </p><p>Therefore, to the end [that] the words of Stephen might agree with the place of Moses, it is to be thought that that false number which was found in the Greek translation of Genesis was by them put in also in this place; concerning which, if any man contend more stubbornly, let us suffer him to be wise without measure. Let us remember that it is not without cause that Paul doth forbid us to be too curious about genealogies. This, so small a number, is purposely expressed, to the end the power of God may the more plainly appear, in so great an enlarging of that kindred, which was of no long continuance. For such a small handful of men could not, by any human manner of engendering, grow to such an infinite multitude as is recorded in <span class="bvs">Exo_12:37</span>, within two hundred and fifty years. We ought rather to weigh the miracle which the Spirit commendeth unto us in this place, than to stand long about one letter, whereby the number is altered. There arise other questions (and those which are more hard to be answered) out of the rest of the text, [context.] </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(400)</span> “Apud quas recepta erat illa lectio,” among whom that reading was received. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(401)</span> “Nepotes ac pronepotes,” grandsons and great-grandsons. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(402)</span> “Librariorum,” copyists. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(403)</span> “Familiariter,” familiar with. </p></div></div>
