<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_16:19</span><strong>.</strong><em>And sat down at the right hand of God. </em>In other passages I have explained what is meant by this expression, namely, that Christ was raised on high, that he might be exalted above angels and all creatures; that by his agency the Father might govern the world, and, in short, that <em>before him every knee might bow, </em>(<span class="bvs">Phi_2:10</span>.) It is the same as if he were called God’s Deputy, to represent the person of God; and, therefore, we must not imagine to ourselves any one place, since <em>the right hand </em>is a metaphor which denotes the power that is next to God. This was purposely added by Mark, in order to inform us that Christ <em>was taken up into heaven, </em>not to enjoy blessed rest at a distance from us, but to govern the world for the salvation of all believers. </p><p><strong>20.</strong><em>And they went out and preached. </em>Mark here notices briefly those events of which Luke continues the history in his second book <span class="cite-ref">(325)</span> that the voice of a small and dispersed body of men resounded even to the extremities of the world. For exactly in proportion as the fact was less credible, so much the more manifestly was there displayed in it a miracle of heavenly power. Every person would have thought that, by the death of the cross, Christ would either be altogether extinguished, or so completely overwhelmed, that he would never be again mentioned but with shame and loathing. The apostles, whom he had chosen to be his witnesses, had basely deserted him, and had betaken themselves to darkness and concealment. Such was their ignorance and want of education, and such was the contempt in which they were held, that they hardly ventured to utter a word in public. Was it to be expected that men who were unlearned, and were held in no esteem, and had even deserted their Master, should, by the sound of their voice, reduce so many scattered nations into subjection to him who had been crucified? There is great emphasis, therefore, in the words, <em>they went out and preached everywhere </em>— <em>men </em>who but lately shut themselves up, trembling and silent, in their prison. For it was impossible that so sudden a change should be accomplished in a moment by human power; and therefore Mark adds, </p><p><em>The Lord working with them; </em>by which he means that this was truly a divine work. And yet by this mode of expression he does not represent them as sharing their work or labor with the grace of God, as if they contributed any thing to it of themselves; but simply means that they were assisted by God, because, according to the flesh, they would in vain have attempted what was actually performed by them. The ministers of the word, I acknowledge, are called <em>fellow-workers with God, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_3:9</span>,) because he makes use of their agency; but we ought to understand that they have no power beyond what he bestows, and that by <em>planting and watering </em>they do no good, unless the increase come from the secret efficacy of the Spirit. </p><p><em>And confirming the word. </em>Here, in my opinion, Mark points out a particular instance of what he had just now stated in general terms; for there were other methods by which the Lord <em>wrought with them, </em>that the preaching of the gospel might not be fruitless; but this was a striking proof of his assistance, that he confirmed their doctrine by miracles. Now this passage shows what use we ought to make of miracles, if we do not choose to apply them to perverse corruptions; namely, that they aid the gospel. Hence it follows that God’s holy order is subverted, if miracles are separated from the word of God, to which they are appendages; and if they are employed to adorn wicked doctrines, or to disguise corrupt modes of worship. </p><p><strong>(325)</strong> That inspired book which is now generally known by the name of <em>The Acts of the Apostles</em>, was often denominated, by older writers, <em>Second Luke</em>. — Ed. </p></div>
