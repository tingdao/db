<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>So then the law is indeed holy</em>, <em>etc. </em>Some think that the words <em>law </em>and <em>commandment </em>is a repetition of the same thing; with whom I agree; <span class="cite-ref">(216)</span> and I consider that there is a peculiar force in the words, when he says, that the law itself and whatever is commanded in the law, is <em>holy</em>, and therefore to be regarded with the highest reverence, — that it is<em>just</em>, and cannot therefore be charged with anything wrong, — that it is <em>good, </em>and hence pure and free from everything that can do harm. He thus defends the law against every charge of blame, that no one should ascribe to it what is contrary to goodness, justice, and holiness. </p><p><strong>(216)</strong> This is doubtless true, and it is an example of what the Apostle’s manner of writing is, it being that of the ancient prophets. How various are the words used in the <span class="bvs">Psa_119:0</span> to designate the law or the revealed will of God? and two different words are often used in the same verse. </p><p>Having spoken of the law in connection with sin, the Apostle may be supposed to have had the character of sin in view in characterizing the law. Sin works depraved desires and lusts; the law is <em>holy: </em>sin deceives and acts the traitor, the law is plain-dealing and <em>just: </em>sin leads to death and misery; the law is <em>good </em>and leads to happiness. The last contrast is evident from what follows in the next verse, “Was that which is good made death unto me?” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
