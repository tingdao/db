<div class="comment-content"><p>He then adds, <em>I will restore them, and they shall dwell, he says, in the midst of Jerusalem</em>. He again confirms what I have already stated, — that their return would not be in vain, though many said, that the Jews had done foolishly in having returned so quickly into their own country; and they condemned their determination, as though they had been suddenly carried away by extreme ardor. Hence the Prophet, in order to show that God had dealt faithfully with his people, promises them here a safe and a perpetual habitation at Jerusalem. <em>They shall dwell</em>, he says; that is, “As you now see that you have been gathered, so expect that God will be your protector, so as to render you safe, and to make Jerusalem to be again inhabited, as it had been formerly.” </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>They shall be to me for a people, and I shall be to them for a God</em>. By these words the Prophet confirms what he has hitherto taught, when he now speaks of the renewal of the covenant; for the whole hope of the people depended on this one thing, — that God remembered the covenant which he had made with them. This covenant had indeed been broken, according to the usual language of Scripture; for the people, when removed into exile, thought that they were cast away and forsaken by God. As then the memory of this covenant had been buried as to the effect, or as they say, apparently, the Prophet, in order to confirm what he has already said, expressly declares, that they would be God’s people, and that he would be their God. We now then understand why he adds, “I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people”. </p><p>In the last place he says, <em>in truths and righteousness</em>; that is, “settled and permanent shall be this felicity”: for when God shows that he cares for his people, then follow outward blessings, which are evidences of his favor. The Prophet adds, that this shall be in truth and righteousness; for God will not be propitious and kind to his people only for a short time, but will continue his favor to them to the end. As then God intended to establish the safety of the city, he testifies that he would be its God in <em>righteousness</em>, even in sincerity, in good faith, and without dissimulation, and also without any danger of changing. <span class="cite-ref">(83)</span> And how this was to be fulfilled we shall hereafter see. </p><p><strong>(83)</strong><em>Blayney </em>and <em>Henderson </em>consider these words, “truth” and “righteousness,” as belonging as equally to the two foregoing sentences, as applying to the people as well as to God. But they seem more properly as applying to God, as truth connected with righteousness refers to his faithfulness, confirmed by his justice in the performance of his promise. God is true or faithful, and further, he is righteous or just, so that what he has promised will surely be fulfilled. See <span class="bvs">1Jo_1:9</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
