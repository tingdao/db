Lest the Corinthians, therefore, should take it amiss, that he refused their liberality, while he allowed himself to be assisted by the Macedonians, and even declared with an oath that he would do so still, he anticipates that suspicion also. And by the figure termed <em>anthypophora, </em><span class="cite-ref">(828)</span> he asks, as it were in their name, whether this is a token of a malevolent mind? He does not return a direct answer to the question, but the indirect answer that he returns has much more weight, inasmuch as he calls God to be a witness of his good disposition towards them. You see here, that in the course of three verses <span class="cite-ref">(829)</span> there are two oaths, but they are lawful and holy, because they have a good design in view, and a legitimate reason is involved. Hence to condemn indiscriminately all oaths is to act the part of fanatics, who make no distinction between white and black. <span class="cite-ref">(830)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(828)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Pour repoudre &amp; l’objection</span>;” — “With the view of replying to the objection.” — See Calvin on the Corinthians, volume 1. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(829)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ces trois lignes</span>;” — “These three lines.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(830)</span> “An oath is to be used, when other means are deficient; and more particularly, we are then only to swear, when the honor of God is concerned, or Religion and Christianity is falsely accused; and these are public grounds.
