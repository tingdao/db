<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And though he wished to put him to death. </em>There is some appearance of contradiction between the words of <em>Matthew </em>and <em>Mark: </em>for the former says that Herod was desirous to commit this shocking murder, but was restrained by the fear of the people; while the latter charges Herodias alone with this cruelty. But the difficulty is soon removed. At first Herod would have been unwilling, if a stronger necessity had not compelled him reluctantly to do so, to put to death the holy man; because he regarded him with reverence, and, indeed, was prevented by religious scruples from practising such atrocious cruelty against a prophet of God; and that he afterwards shook off this fear of God, in consequence of the incessant urgency of Herodias; but that afterwards, when infuriated by that demon he longed for the death of the holy man, he was withheld by a new restraint, because he dreaded on his own account a popular commotion. And here we must attend to the words of Mark, <em>Herodias lay in wait for him; </em><span class="cite-ref">(359)</span> which imply, that as Herod was not of himself sufficiently disposed to commit the murder, she either attempted to gain him over by indirect wiles, or labored to find some secret method of putting the holy man to death. I am more disposed to adopt the former view, that she employed stratagems for influencing the mind of her husband, but did not succeed, so long as Herod was prevented by remorse of conscience from pronouncing sentence of death on the holy man. Next followed another fear that the business of his death should excite the people to some insurrection. But Mark glances only at what prevented Herod from yielding immediately to the entreaties of the prostitute; for Herodias would have wished that, as soon as John was thrown into prison, he should be privately executed. Herod, on the contrary, reverenced the holy man, so far as even to comply willingly with his advises: <em>Herod feared John </em>Now the <em>fear </em>which is here mentioned, was not a <em>dread </em>arising from a mistaken opinion, as we <em>dread </em>those who have obtained some authority over us, though we reckon them to be unworthy of the honor. But this <em>fear </em>was a voluntary respect; for Herod was convinced that he was a holy man and a faithful servant of God, and therefore did not dare to despise him. <span class="cite-ref">(360)</span> And this deserves our attention; for though John knew by experience that it was, in many respects, advantageous for him to have some share in the good wishes of the tetrarch, <span class="cite-ref">(361)</span> yet he was not afraid to offend him, when he could find no other way of securing that favor, than by wickedly conniving at a known and disgraceful crime. He might indeed have protested that he did not at all consult his private interests, and that he had no other object in view than the public advantage; for it is certain that he requested nothing from motives of ambition <span class="cite-ref">(362)</span> but that Herod yielded to his holy counsels, which had a reference to the lawful administration of the kingdom. But as he perceives that he has no right to accept this kind of compensation, <span class="cite-ref">(363)</span> which would procure for him some kind offices by betraying the truth, he chooses rather to turn a friend into an enemy than to encourage, by flattery or silence, an evil which he is laid under the necessity of reproving with severity. </p><p>John has thus, by his example, furnished an undoubted rule for pious teachers, not to wink at the faults of princes, so as to purchase their favor at this price, how advantageous soever that favor might appear to be to the public interests. <span class="cite-ref">(364)</span> In Herod, on the other hand, the Spirit of God exhibits, as in a mirror, how frequently it happens that those who do not sincerely worship God are nevertheless willing, in some measure, to obey His commands, provided that He will grant them some indulgence or abatement. But whenever they are hard pressed, they throw off the yoke, and break out not only into obstinacy, but into rage. There is no reason, therefore, why they who comply with many sound advises should be well satisfied with themselves, till they have learned to yield and surrender themselves unreservedly to God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(359)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Herodias cherchoit occasion</span>;” — “Herodias sought an opportunity.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(360)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estoit aucunement contreint en soy mesme de luv porter l’honneur, et ne l’osoit pas mespriser</span>;” — “was somewhat constrained in himself to bear respect towards him, and did not dare to despise him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(361)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il eust quelque entree en la Cour, et que le Roy l’eust aucunement agreable</span>;” — “that he should have some access to the Court, and that the King should be somewhat favorable to him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(362)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il n’a rien demande au Roy pour se faire valoir, ou pour monstrer son credit</span>;” — “that he asked nothing from the King to put himself forward, or to display his influence.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(363)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que ceste facon de compensation n’est point honneste, ne selon Dieu</span>;” — “that this kind of compensation is not honorable, nor according to God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(364)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Encore qu’ils ne la cherchent point pour leur regard particulier, mais seulement pour avoir occasion de profiter plus en d’autres endroits</span>;” —”even though they do not seek it for their private interest, but solely in order to have an opportunity of doing more good in other respects.” </p></div></div>
