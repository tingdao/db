And this is the most desirable kind c f liberty, that we should not be compelled to obey every’ person who may be tyrannically put over our heads; but which allows of election, so that no one should rule except he be approved of by us. And this is further confirmed in the next verse, wherein Moses recounts that he awaited the consent of the people, and that nothing was attempted which did not please them all. Again, he does not here mention the same virtues as in <span class="bvs">Exo_18:0</span>; but only distinguishes the judges by three qualifications, viz., that they should be wise, and understanding, and experienced, all of which are comprised under one head, that they should possess acuteness of intellect and prudence, confirmed by experience and practice; for neither the greatest probity nor diligence would be sufficient; for the office of ruler, apart from skill and sagacity. <span class="cite-ref">(204)</span> But the first epithet which the Hebrews often apply in a bad sense to the crafty and deceitful, here means acute and perspicacious. The second I explain as pointing out prudent persons, endued with sound judgment and discretion. <span class="cite-ref">(205)</span> The third may be taken either actively or passively; some therefore translate it known or tried; but here the active sense is most suitable. Thus, then, experience and acquaintance with business is required in judges; because none but the practiced are competent for the management of business. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(204)</span><span class="lang he-il">חכמים</span>, wise men. <em>C</em>. had already said in his Commentary on <span class="bvs">Exo_1:10</span>, that the Hebrews often used this epithet in an ill sense, but the assertion is scarcely tenable. — <em>W </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(205)</span><span class="lang he-il">ידעים</span>. The third characteristic can only be said to be ambiguous by such as reject the authority of the Hebrew points. The translators who admit that authority must hold this participle to be passive: and therefore our <em>A. V. </em>renders the clause, known among your tribes. — <em>W </em></p></div></div>
