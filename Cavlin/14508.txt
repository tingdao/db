<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17</strong><em>Surely I am ready to halt </em>This verse has led expositors to suppose that David was afflicted with some sore, from which he was afraid of having brought upon him the infirmity of halting all his days; but I have already shown, in <span class="bvs">Psa_35:15</span>, that this supposition is very improbable. We have certainly no greater reason for supposing that David was lame than that Jeremiah was so, when he said, </p><p>“All my familiars watched for my halting.” — <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Jer_20:10</span>,) </p><p>I therefore think that David here employs a metaphorical mode of expression, and that his meaning is, that if God did not soon come to his aid, there was no hope of his ever being restored to his former condition; and that he was so greatly afflicted, that he would walk as if he had been maimed or lame all the days of his life. <span class="cite-ref">(57)</span> It next follows by way of exposition, that <em>his sorrow was continually before him. </em>The sense is, that he was so grievously afflicted, that he could not forget it for a single moment, so as to obtain some relaxation. In both the clauses of the verse, David confesses that his disease is incurable, unless he obtain some remedy from God, and that he cannot endure it, unless he be raised up and sustained by the hand of God himself. This is the reason why he directs all his thoughts and his requests to God alone; for as soon as he shall turn aside from him, he sees nothing but immediate ruin. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(57)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et que son affliction est telle, qu’il ne sera jour de sa vie qu’il ne s’en sente</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “And that his affliction was such, that there would not be a day of his life but he would feel it.” </p></div></div>
