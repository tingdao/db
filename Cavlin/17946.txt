<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>He made the world as a wilderness. </em>He expresses the cruel and savage disposition of the tyrant, by saying that he <em>brought desolation on the world</em>, that he <em>overthrew cities</em>, that he <em>did not release prisoners</em>. It is sometimes the custom of conquerors to release prisoners, in order to win their hearts by kindness; but tyrants choose rather to be feared than to be loved. They think that the only way to reign is to strike terror into all by inexorable cruelty. There is no reason to wonder, therefore, that their end is so wretched and dismal; for it is impossible that the Lord should not, after having chastised his Church by their cruelty, give them like for like, and withhold all compassion from those who failed to exercise compassion to others. He therefore shows how wretched tyrants are, for they have God for their enemy, and are hated by men. </p></div>
