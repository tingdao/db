<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_6:22</span><strong>.</strong><em>The light of the body is the eye </em>We must bear in mind, as I have already hinted, that what we find here are detached sentences, and not a continued discourse. The substance of the present statement is, that men go wrong through carelessness, because they do not keep their eye fixed, as they ought to do, on the proper object. For whence comes it, that they so shamefully wander, or dash themselves, or stumble, but because, having corrupted their judgment by choosing rather to follow their own lusts than the righteousness of God, they not only extinguish the light of reason, which ought to have regulated their life, but change it altogether into darkness. </p><p>When Christ calls <em>the eye the light of the body, </em><span class="cite-ref">(456)</span> he employs a comparison which means, that neither the hands, nor the feet, nor the belly, serves to direct men in walking, but that the eye alone is a sufficient guide to the rest of the members. If the hands and feet are foolishly and improperly directed, the blame of the mistake ought to be charged on the eyes, which do not perform their duty. We must now apply this comparison to the mind. The affections may be regarded individually as its members: but as they are blind in themselves, they need direction. Now, God has given reason to guide them, and to act the part of a <em>lantern </em>in showing them the way. But what is the usual result? All the soundness of judgment which had been given to men is corrupted and perverted by themselves, so that not even one spark of light continues to dwell in them. </p><p><em>A simple eye </em>means an eye that has no speck, or diseased humor, or any other defect. <em>An evil eye </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">πονηρὸν</span>) <span class="cite-ref">(457)</span> means a <em>diseased eye</em>. A luminous body means one that is <em>enlightened, </em>so as to have all its actions properly regulated. A <em>dark </em>body is one which is led into numerous mistakes by a confused movement. We see, then, as I have already said, that these words reprove the indolence of men, who neglect to open their eyes for the guidance of their affections. </p><p>The inference which the Papists draw from this passage, that men possess as much reason and wisdom, as to be free to choose either good or evil, is mere trifling. For Christ does not here inform us what ability we possess, but how we ought to walk, by having our eye fixed on a certain object; and at the same time shows, that the whole course of human life is dark, because no man proposes for himself a proper object, but all permit themselves to pursue eagerly what is evil. I confess, indeed, that men naturally possess reason, to distinguish between vices and virtues; but I say that it is so corrupted by sin, that it fails at every step. Meanwhile, it does not follow, that men do not voluntarily bring darkness on themselves, as if they shut their eyes to avoid the light which was offered to them, because they are knowingly and willingly carried after their own lusts. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(456)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Appelant l'ceil le flambeau ou la lampe de tout le corps</span>;” — “calling the eye the torch or the lamp of the whole body.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(457)</span> This Greek word has two meanings, which depend on accentuation. The <em>proparoxytone </em><span class="lang el-gr">πονηρὸς </span> means <em>laborious, troublesome: </em>but the <em>oxytone </em><span class="lang el-gr">πονηρὸς </span> means <em>wicked </em>Here, when applied to <em>the eye, </em>it cannot denote moral blame, but easily takes the transferred sense of <em>faulty, defective</em>. —<em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
