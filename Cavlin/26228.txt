<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>My Father worketh hitherto. </em>We must see what kind of defense Christ employs. He does not reply that the Law about keeping the Sabbath was temporary, and that it ought now to be abolished; but, on the contrary, maintains that he has not violated the Law, because this is a divine work. It is true that the ceremony of the Sabbath was a part of the shadows of the Law, <span class="cite-ref">(99)</span> and that Christ put an end to it by his coming, as Paul shows, (<span class="bvs">Col_2:16</span>;) but the present question does not turn on that point. For it is only from their own works that men are commanded to abstain; and, accordingly, circumcision — which is a work of God, and not of men — is not at variance with the Sabbath. </p><p>What Christ insists upon is this, that the holy rest which was enjoined by the Law of Moses is not disturbed when we are employed in works of God. <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> And for this reason he excuses not only his own action, but also the action of the man who carried his bed; for it was an appendage, and — as we might say — a part of the miracle, for it was nothing else than an approbation of it. Besides, if thanksgiving and the publication of the divine glory be reckoned among the works of God, it was not a profanation of the Sabbath to testify the grace of God by feet and hands. But it is chiefly concerning himself that Christ speaks, to whom the Jews were more hostile. He declares that the soundness of body which he has restored to the diseased man is a demonstration of his divine power. He asserts that he is the Son of God, and that he acts in the same manner as his Father. </p><p>What is the use of the Sabbath, and for what reasons it was enjoined, I do not now argue at greater length. It is enough for the present passage, that the keeping of the Sabbath is so far from interrupting or hindering the works of God, that, on the contrary, it gives way to them alone. For why does the Law enjoin men to abstain from their own works, but in order to keep all their senses free and occupied for considering the works of God? Consequently, he who does not, on the Sabbath, allow a free course and reign to the works of God, is not only a false expounder of the Law, but wickedly overturns it. </p><p>If it be objected, that the example of God is held out to men, that they may rest on the seventh day, the answer is easy. Men are not conformed to God in this respect, that He ceased to work, but by abstaining from the troublesome actions of this world and aspiring to the heavenly rest. The <em>Sabbath </em>or <em>rest </em>of God, <span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> therefore, is not idleness, but true perfection, which brings along with it a calm state of peace. Nor is this inconsistent with what Moses says, that <em>God put an end to his works</em>, (<span class="bvs">Gen_2:2</span>;) for he means that, after having completed the formation of the world, God consecrated that day, that men might employ it in meditating on his works. Yet He did not cease to sustain by this power the world which he had made, to govern it by his wisdom, to support it by his goodness, and to regulate all things according to his pleasure, both in heaven and on earth. In six days, therefore, the creation of the world was completed, but the administration of it is still continued, and God incessantly <em>worketh </em>in maintaining and preserving the order of it; as Paul informs us, that <em>in him we live</em>, <em>and move</em>, <em>and are</em>, (<span class="bvs">Act_17:28</span>;) and David informs us, that all things stand so long as the Spirit of God upholds them, and that they fail as soon as he withdraws his support, (<span class="bvs">Psa_104:29</span>.) Nor is it only by a general Providence that the Lord maintains the world which He has created, but He arranges and regulates every part of it, and more especially, by his protection, he keeps and guards believers whom he has received under his care and guardianship. </p><p><em>And I work. </em>Leaving the defense of the present cause, Christ now explains the end and use of the miracle, namely, that by means of it he may be acknowledged to be the Son of God; for the object which he had in view in all his words and actions was, to show that he was the Author of salvation. What he now claims for himself belongs to his Divinity, as the Apostle also says, that </p><p>he upholdeth all things by his powerful will, (<span class="bvs">Heb_1:3</span>.) </p><p>But when he testifies that he is God, it is that, being manifested in the flesh, he may perform the office of Christ; and when he affirms that he came from heaven, it is chiefly for the purpose of informing us for what purpose he came down to earth. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(99)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il est bien vray que la ceremonie du Sabbath estoit une partie des ombres de la Loy</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(100)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand on s’employe a oeuvres de Dieu</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le Repos de Dieu</span>.” </p></div></div>
