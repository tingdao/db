<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>His disciples came. </em>One thing only remained to complete the womanâ€™s cruelty. It was, to leave the corpse of the holy man unburied; for there is reason to believe that, when <em>his disciples </em>performed this duty, the attendants of the tyrant had thrown out the corpse. Though the honor of burial is of no importance to the dead, yet it is the will of the Lord that we should observe this ceremony as a token of the last resurrection; and therefore God was pleased with the carefulness which was manifested by the disciples, when they came to commit to the tomb the body of their master. Moreover, it was an attestation of their piety; for in this way they declared that the doctrine of their master continued to have a firm hold of their hearts after his death. This confession was therefore worthy of praise, more especially as it was not without danger; for they could not do honor to a man who had been put to death by the executioner without exciting against themselves the rage of the tyrant. </p></div>
