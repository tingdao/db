<div class="comment-content"><p>In this verse the Prophet confirms what he lately touched upon, viz., that the temple was filled with blackness, because God had transferred his glory away. He says then, <em>that the brightness of God’s glory appeared above the threshold </em>But the glory of God resided in the sanctuary and in the very ark of the covenant; but now, when it advances to the threshold, it is just as if he should extinguish the splendor of his glory by which the temple was adorned, and transfer it elsewhere. But he says, <em>that the glory of Jehovah was elevated from its place: </em>these words signify change of place: God is everywhere said to dwell between the cherubim, and he wished to <em>be </em>called upon there; but now his glory is said to be removed elsewhere. Hence, therefore, it appears, that the temple was deprived of God’s presence, and was in some sense stripped of its furniture; for without God what remained? Hence that darkness which was formerly mentioned, and is again repeated. The glory of Jehovah then was withdrawn: from whence? from its own place and station, where it dwelt between the cherubim, and came to the threshold of the temple: then he says, all was changed. For the temple in which God’s glory formerly shone forth became full of darkness; but the threshold of the house, which was as it were profane, was full of splendor: not that God dwelt at the threshold, for this vision has another meaning, viz., that God after leaving his temple appeared without it; for by the threshold he signifies a place conspicuous to all. Now therefore we understand the design of the Holy Spirit when he says, <em>the glory of Jehovah was elevated from that seat, </em>which he had chosen as a <em>residence </em>for himself between the cherubim, <em>and was conspicuous above the threshold: </em>whence it happened that the temple itself grew dark, but God’s brightness was conspicuous in the court itself.
