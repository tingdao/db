<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And when the chief priest came. </em>The chief priest calleth all the council together now, lest, if giving the honor to his own sect, he omit others, and be not able to bear the burden; therefore, he is enforced by fear to call the multitude together, notwithstanding they observe diligently and straitly the form of law. The elders are called who did govern, that nothing may be done but according to the sentence and authority of the council. Who would not have hoped for a moderate end, seeing they began thus? and surely they pretend what color they can, lest they seem to oppress the truth violently and tyrannously; but when they hear that the apostles teach in the temple, howsoever they know that they came not out by deceit of man, but miraculously, yet they hold on still in their purpose; where appeareth, together with the ungodliness of behavior and contempt of God, horrible fury and want of reason. Therefore, the beautiful colors of right and equity <span class="cite-ref">(260)</span> do never so cover hypocrites, but that they do at length betray their wickedness. They must need certainly gather by all circumstances, that it is the work of God that the prison was opened, yet they do not doubt openly to rage against God. </p><p>These things are also meet for our time. We know how proudly the Papists boast of that maxim of theirs, that lawful councils must be obeyed, because they represent the Church. Moreover, they call those lawful councils, and they will have them so accounted, wherein nothing is wanting touching the external form, and such a council was this whereof Luke speaketh in this place; and yet, notwithstanding, we know that it was gathered to put out <span class="cite-ref">(261)</span> the name of Christ; for although the priests did then creep in unto honor by subtlety, or by inordinate suit, <span class="cite-ref">(262)</span> to win the favor of men, or by other wicked policies, or whether they burst in unto the same by bribery, or murder, <span class="cite-ref">(263)</span> yet the dignity of the priesthood did continue as yet until Christ was revealed. There was in the assembly of the elders a representing of the Church; but where the truth of God is not sought, all outward appearance is nothing else but a mere visor. Therefore, it is in vain for the Papists to cover their abominations with the shadow of this buckler, because it is not sufficient for those to be gathered together who are rulers of the Church, unless they do this in the name of Christ, otherwise forasmuch as it is an usual policy of Satan to transform himself into an angel of light, (<span class="bvs">2Co_11:14</span>,) we will grant him as fit a covert under the title of the Church as he can wish. </p><p><em>He brought them without violence. </em>We have spoken somewhat before of the captain of the temple. For I do not think <span class="cite-ref">(264)</span> that it was lawful for the Jews to set and appoint whom they would to rule the temple, but that the president of the province did appoint one to have the government of the temple. And he saith, that they were brought without violence, that is, that they were not drawn violently, lest any tumult should arise, so that, whereas they neither fear nor <em>reverence </em>God, they are afraid of men. The apostles also do show their modesty in that, that whereas they are guided with a great number of men, yet do they suffer themselves to be led away by the officers, lest they should be authors of any tumult. </p><p><strong>(260)</strong> “Speciosi juris praetextus,” the specious pretexts of law. </p><p><strong>(261)</strong> “Extinguendam,” to extinguish. </p><p><strong>(262)</strong> “Ambitu,” by intrigue. </p><p><strong>(263)</strong> “Mutuis caedibus,” mutual slaughter. </p><p><strong>(264)</strong> “Neque enim mihi probabile est,” for it does not seem to me probable. </p></div>
