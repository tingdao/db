<div class="comment-content"><p>Although I think that this narrative has nothing more than a resemblance to what is related by Matthew in the 22<span class="cite-ref">nd</span>, and by Mark in the 12<span class="cite-ref">th</span> chapter, of his Gospel, and that they are not the same; I have chosen to collect them into one place, because, while Matthew and Mark affirm that this was the last <em>question </em>by which our Lord was <em>tempted, </em>Luke makes no mention of that circumstance, and seems intentionally to leave it out, because he had stated it in another passage. And yet I do not dispute that it may be the same narrative, though Luke has some things different from the other two. They all agree in this, that the <em>scribe </em>put a question for the sake of tempting Christ; but he who is described by Matthew and Mark goes away with no bad disposition; for he acquiesces in Christ’s reply, and shows a sign of a teachable and gentle mind: to which must be added, that Christ, on the other hand, declares that he <em>is not far from the kingdom of God. </em>Luke, on the other hand, introduces a man who was obstinate and swelled with pride, in whom no evidence of repentance is discovered. Now there would be no absurdity in saying that Christ was repeatedly <em>tempted </em>on the subject of true righteousness, and of keeping the Law, and of the rule of a good life. But whether Luke has related this out of its proper place, or whether he has now passed by the other question — because that former narrative relating to doctrine was sufficient — the similarity of the doctrine seemed to require me to compare the three Evangelists with each other. </p><p>Let us now see what was the occasion that led this <em>scribe </em>to put a question to Christ. It is because, being an expounder of the Law, he is offended at the doctrine of the gospel, by which he supposes the authority of Moses to be diminished. At the same time, he is not so much influenced by zeal for the Law, as by displeasure at losing some part of the honor of his teaching. He therefore inquires at Christ, if he wishes to profess any thing more perfect than the Law; for, though he does not say this in words, yet his question is ensnaring, for the purpose of exposing Christ to the hatred of the people. Matthew and Mark do not attribute this stratagem to one man only, but show that it was done by mutual arrangement, and that out of the whole sect one person was chosen who was thought to excel the rest in ability and learning. In the form of the question, too, Luke differs somewhat from Matthew and Mark; for, according to him, the <em>scribe </em>inquires <em>what </em>men <em>must do to obtain eternal life, </em>but according to the other two Evangelists, he inquires <em>what is the chief commandment in the law. </em>But the design is the same, for he makes a deceitful attack on Christ, that, if he can draw any thing from his lips that is at variance with <em>the law, </em>he may exclaim against him as an apostate and a promoter of ungodly revolt. </p></div>
