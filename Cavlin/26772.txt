<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And these things I speak in the world. </em>Here Christ shows that the reason why he was so earnest in praying for his disciples was, not that he was anxious about their future condition, but rather to provide a remedy for their anxiety. We know how prone our minds are to seek external aids; and if these present themselves, we eagerly seize them, and do not easily suffer ourselves to be torn from them. Christ, therefore, prays to his Father in the presence of his disciples, not because he needed any words, but to remove from them all doubt. <em>I speak in the world, </em>says he; that is, within their hearing, or, in their presence, <span class="cite-ref">(120)</span> that their minds may be calm; for their salvation already was in no danger, having been placed by Christ in the hands of God. </p><p><em>That they may have my joy fulfilled. </em>He calls it <em>HIS joy, </em>because it was necessary that the disciples should obtain it from him; or, if you choose to express it more briefly, he calls it <em>his, </em>because he is the Author, Cause, and Pledge of it; for in us there is nothing but alarm and uneasiness, but in Christ alone there is peace and joy. </p><p><strong>(120)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En leur presence</span>.” </p></div>
