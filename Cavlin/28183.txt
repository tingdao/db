<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>For I will finish and shorten the matter, etc. </em><span class="cite-ref">(312)</span> Omitting various interpretations, I will state what appears to me to be the real meaning: The Lord will so cut short, and cut off his people, that the residue may seem as it were a consumption, that is, may have the appearance and the vestige of a very great ruin. However, the few who shall remain from the consumption shall be a proof of the work of God’s righteousness, or, what I prefer, shall serve to testify the righteousness of God throughout the world. As <em>word </em>often in Scripture means a thing, the consummated word is put for consumption. Many interpreters have here been grossly mistaken, who have attempted to philosophize with too much refinement; for they have imagined, that the doctrine of the gospel is thus called, because it is, when the ceremonies are cut off, a brief compendium of the law; though the word means on the contrary a consumption. <span class="cite-ref">(313)</span> And not only here is an error committed by the translator, but also in <span class="bvs">Isa_10:22</span>; <span class="bvs">Isa_28:22</span>; and in <span class="bvs">Eze_11:13</span>; where it is said, “Ah! ah! Lord God! wilt thou make a completion of the remnant of Israel<em>?” </em>But the Prophets meant to say, “Wilt thou destroy the very remnant with utter destruction?<em>” </em>And this has happened through the ambiguity of the Hebrew word. For as the word, <span class="lang he-il">כלה</span><em>, cale, </em>means to finish and to perfect, as well as to consume, this difference has not been sufficiently observed according to the passages in which it occurs. </p><p>But Isaiah has not in this instance adopted one word only, but has put down two words, <em>consumption, </em>and <em>termination, </em>or cutting off; so that the affectation of Hebraism in the Greek translator was singularly unseasonable; for to what purpose was it to involve a sentence, in itself clear, in an obscure and figurative language? It may be further added, that Isaiah speaks here hyperbolically; for by consumption he means diminution, such as is wont to be after a remarkable slaughter. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(312)</span>Sermonem enim consummans et abbrevians,” etc<span class="lang el-gr">.; Λόγον γὰρ, </span> etc. It is literally the <em>Septuagint </em>except in two instances: Paul puts in<span class="lang el-gr">γὰρ, </span> and substitutes <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπὶ τὢς γὢς </span> for ἐν <span class="lang el-gr">τὣ οἰκουμένὟ ὅλὟ. </span> It is a difficult passage in Hebrew: but the following rendering will make it materially consistent with the words of the Apostle, who evidently did not intend to give the words literally. </p><p>A destruction, soon executed, <LineBreak /><em>Shall </em>overflow in righteousness; <LineBreak />For completed and soon executed shall it be; <LineBreak />The Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall do <em>it, </em><em><LineBreak /></em>In the midst of the whole land. </p><p>The word rendered above “soon executed,” means literally, abbreviated or cut short, signifying the quick execution of a thing or work. <em>“Shall </em>overflow in righteousness,” imports, “<em>shall </em>justly or deservedly overflow.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(313)</span> There are many venerable names in favour of this opinion, such as [<span class="bvs">Ambrose </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Augustine </span>] <em>, </em>etc. Not knowing the Hebrew language, they attached a classical meaning to the expression<span class="lang el-gr">, λόγον συντετμημένον, </span> wholly at variance with what the Hebrew means, as [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] justly observes. The word<span class="lang el-gr">, συντετμημένον, </span> in this passage, as [<span class="bvs">Schleusner </span>] says, bears a meaning different from what it has in the classics; it imports what is cut short, that is, quickly executed. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
