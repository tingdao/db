<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>They will go from strength to strength. </em>In this verse the same sentiment is repeated. Mount Zion being the place where, according to the appointment of the law, the holy assemblies were observed, after the ark of the covenant was removed thither, it is said, that the people of God will come to Zion in great numbers, provoking one another to this good work. <span class="cite-ref">(467)</span> The word <span class="lang he-il">חיל</span>, <em>chayil, </em>seldom signifies <em>a troop, </em>or <em>band of men, </em>but most commonly <em>power, </em>or <em>strength. </em>It will therefore be more in accordance with the ordinary use of the term, to translate, <em>They will go from strength to strength; </em><span class="cite-ref">(468)</span> implying, that the saints are continually acquiring fresh strength for going up to mount Zion, and continue to prosecute their journey without weariness or fatigue, until they reach the wished-for place, and behold the countenance of God. If the word <em>troop </em>is preferred, the meaning will be, that not a few only will come, but numerous companies. The manner in which God manifested himself to his servants in the temple in old time, we have spoken of elsewhere, and especially on the 27<span class="cite-ref">th</span> psalm, at the 4<span class="cite-ref">th</span> and 5<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verses. No visible image of God was there to be seen; but the ark of the covenant was a symbol of his presence, and genuine worshippers found from experience, that by this means they were greatly aided in approaching him. </p><p><strong>(467)</strong> “Horsley reads, ‘from wall to wall;’ Merrick, ‘from station to station;’ others, ‘from virtue to virtue,’ in the military sense. All come to the same effect; they persevere through all difficulty or opposition, having their hearts set on reaching Zion’s hill.” — <em>Williams</em>. “I think with Gejerus that the Hebrew may be translated <em>from strength to strength</em>, (answerably to the words<em>from faith to faith</em>, <span class="bvs">Rom_1:17</span>, and <em>from glory to glory</em>, <span class="bvs">2Co_3:18</span>,) and signify, that whereas other travelers grow more and more weary as they travel, each of the pious persons here described shall, by the refreshments administered to them, proceed from one degree of strength to another, <em>viresque acquiret eundo </em>. As Jerusalem is represented in the New Testament as a type of heaven, I see nothing irrational in supposing that the inspired writer might, in describing the ascent to Jerusalem, have in view also that spiritual progress which leads to the city which is above, the mother of us all. The words before us are certainly very applicable to the advances made in this progress, from strength to strength, from one stage of Christian perfection to another.” —<em>Merrick </em>’<em>s Annotations</em>. </p><p><strong>(468)</strong> “<em class="lang fr-fr">Ailleurs </em>.” This supplement is not in the Latin version. </p></div>
