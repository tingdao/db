<div class="comment-content"><p>The Psalmist confirms these statements in the next verse, where he tells us that the persons of whom he speaks are fully persuaded in their hearts that they are beyond all danger of change. <em>He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved from generation to generation </em>The ungodly often pour forth proud language to this effect. David, however, only touches the hidden ulcer of their vile arrogance, which they cherish in their own breasts, and therefore he does not say what they speak with their mouth, but what they persuade themselves of in their hearts. It may here be asked, Why does David blame in others what he professes concerning himself in so many places? <span class="cite-ref">(210)</span> for trusting to the protection of God, he courageously triumphs over all dangers. <span class="cite-ref">(211)</span> And surely it becomes the children of God effectually to provide for their safety, so that, although the world should a hundred times fall into ruins, they may have the comfortable assurance that they will remain unmoved. The answer to this question is easy, and it is this, The faithful promise themselves security in God, and no where else; and yet while they do this, they know themselves to be exposed to all the storms of affliction, and patiently submit to them. There is a very great difference between a despiser of God who, enjoying prosperity today, is so forgetful of the condition of man in this world, as through a distempered imagination to build his nest above the clouds, and who persuades himself that he shall always enjoy comfort and repose, <span class="cite-ref">(212)</span> — there is a very great difference between him and the godly man, who, knowing that his life hangs only by a thread, and is encompassed by a thousand deaths, and who, ready to endure any kind of afflictions which shall be sent upon him, and living in the world as if he were sailing upon a tempestuous and dangerous sea, nevertheless, bears patiently all his troubles and sorrows, and comforts himself in his afflictions, because he leans wholly upon the grace of God, and entirely confides in it. <span class="cite-ref">(213)</span> The ungodly man says, I shall not be moved, or I shall not shake for ever; because he thinks himself sufficiently strong and powerful to bear up against all the assaults which shall be made upon him. The faithful man says, What although I may happen to be moved, yea, even fall and sink into the lowest depths? my fall will not be fatal, for God will put his hand under me to sustain me. By this, in like manner, we are furnished with an explanation of the different effects which an apprehension of danger has upon the good and the bad. Good men may tremble and sink into despondency, but this leads them to flee with all haste to the sanctuary of God’s grace; <span class="cite-ref">(214)</span> whereas the ungodly, while they are affrighted even at the noise of a falling leaf, <span class="cite-ref">(215)</span> and live in constant uneasiness, endeavor to harden themselves in their stupidity, and to bring themselves into such a state of giddy frenzy, that being, as it were, carried out of themselves, they may not feel their calamities. The cause assigned for the confidence with which the prosperous ungodly man persuades himself that no change shall come upon him is, <em>because he is not in adversity </em>This admits of two senses. It either means, that the ungodly, because they have been exempted from all calamity and misery during the past part of their life, entertain the hope of a peaceful and joyful state in the time to come; or it means, that through a deceitful imagination they exempt themselves from the common condition of men; just as in Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_28:15</span>) they say, </p><p>“When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, <LineBreak />it shall not come upon us.” </p><p><strong>(210)</strong><span class="bvs">Psa_3:7</span>, <em>etc. </em>—<em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(211)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ose dire hardiment qu’il ne redoute nuls dangers et les desfie tous</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “He courageously declares that he is not afraid of any dangers, and defies them all.” </p><p><strong>(212)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et se fait a croire qu’il sera tousjours a son aise et repos</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(213)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Toutesfois pource qu’il s’appuye du tout sur la grace de Dieu, et s’y confie, porte patienment toutes molestes et ennuis et se console en ses afflictions</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(214)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Se retirent de bonne heure vers la grace de Dieu pour se mettre au sauvete comme en un lien de refuge et asseurance</span>.”— <em>Fr</em>. “Betake themselves with all haste to the grace of God, to put themselves in safety as in a place of refuge and security.” </p><p><strong>(215)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Au bruit des fueilles qui tombent des arbres</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “At the noise of leaves falling from the trees.” </p></div>
