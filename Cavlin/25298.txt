<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_8:52</span><strong>.</strong><em>And all were weeping. </em>The Evangelists mention the lamentation, that the resurrection may be more fully believed. <em>Matthew </em>expressly states that <em>musicians </em>were present, which was not usually the case till the death had been ascertained, and while the preparations for the funeral were going forward. The flute, he tells us, was heard in plaintive airs. Now, though their intention was to bestow this sort of honor on their dead, and as it were to adorn their grave, we see how strongly inclined the world is not only to indulge but to promote its faults. It was their duty to employ every method for allaying grief; but as if they had not sinned enough in disorderly lamentation, they are eager to heighten it by fresh excitements. The Gentiles even thought that this was a way of soothing departed spirits; and hence we see how many corruptions were at that time spread throughout Judea. <span class="cite-ref">(529)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(529)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Dont nous pouvons recueillir comment le pays de Judee estoit lots reinply de beaucoup de corruptions, et diverses sortes d'abus</span>;” — “whence we may infer how much the country of Judea was then filled with many corruptions, and various sorts of abuses.” </p></div></div>
