<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>Whosoever committeth</em>, or <em>doeth, sin</em>. The Apostle has already shown how ungrateful we must be to God, if we make but little account of the honor of adoption, by which he of his own goodwill anticipates us, and if we do not, at least, render him mutual love. He, at the same time, introduced this admonition, that our love ought not to be diminished, because the promised happiness is deferred. But now, as men are wont to indulge themselves more than they ought, in evils, he reproves this perverse indulgence, declaring that all they who sin are wicked and transgressors of the law. For it is probable that there were then those who extenuated their vices by this kind of flattery, “It is no wonder if we sin, because we are men; but there is a great difference between sin and iniquity.” </p><p>This frivolous excuse the Apostle now dissipates, when he defines sin to be a transgression of the divine law; for his object was to produce hatred and horror as to sin. The word <em>sin </em>seems light to some; but iniquity or transgression of the law cannot appear to be so easily forgiven. But the Apostle does not make sins equal, by charging all with iniquity who sin; but he means simply to teach us, that sin arises from a contempt of God, and that by sinning, the law is violated. Hence this doctrine of John has nothing in common with the delirious paradoxes of the Stoics. </p><p>Besides, to <em>sin </em>here, does not mean to offend in some instances; nor is the word <em>sin </em>to be taken for every fault or wrong a man may commit.; but he calls that sin, when men with their whole heart run into evil, nor does he understand that men sin, except those who are given up to sin. For the faithful, who are as yet tempted by the lusts of the flesh, are not to be deemed guilty of iniquity, though they are not pure or free from sin, but as sin does not reign in them, John says that they do not sin, as I shall presently explain more fully. </p><p>The import of the passage is, that the perverse life of those who indulge themselves in the liberty of sinning, is hateful to God, and cannot be borne with by him, because it is contrary to his Law. It does not hence follow, nor can it be hence inferred, that the faithful are iniquitous; because they desire to obey God, and abhor their own vices, and that in every instance; and they also form their own life, as much as in <em>them </em>lieth, according to the law. But when there is a deliberate purpose to sin, or a continued course in sin, then the law is transgressed. <span class="cite-ref">(77)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(77)</span> To do, or to commit, or to work, or to practice, sin, and to sin, are evidently used in the same sense by the Apostle: and to commit or practice sin, according to what he says in his Gospel, (<span class="bvs">Joh_8:34</span>,) is the same with being “the servant of sin.” It is hence evident, that in the language of John, to do sin, or to sin, means a prevailing or an habitual course of sinning. </p><p>We might render the fourth verse thus, — </p><p>“Every doer of sin, is also the doer of unrighteousness; <LineBreak />for sin is unrighteousness,” </p><p>or iniquity, as <em>Calvin </em>renders it. </p><p>The word <span class="lang el-gr">ἀνομία</span>, literally, is lawlessness, but it is never used strictly in this sense either in the <em>Sept </em>or the New Testament. The terms by which it is commonly expressed, are, wickedness, iniquity, transgression, unrighteousness. See <span class="bvs">1Jo_3:7</span>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
