<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>To deliver to Satan for the destruction of the flesh. </em>As the Apostles had been furnished with this power among others, that they could <em>deliver over to Satan </em>wicked and obstinate persons, and made use of him as a scourge to correct them, Chrysostom, and those that follow him, view these words of Paul as referring to a chastisement of that kind, agreeably to the exposition that is usually given of another passage, in reference to Alexander and Hymeneus, (<span class="bvs">Tit_1:20</span>.) <em>To deliver over to Satan</em>, they think, means nothing but the infliction of a severe punishment upon the body. But when I examine the whole context more narrowly, and at the same time compare it with what is stated in <span class="bvs">2Co_2:5</span>, I give up that interpretation, as forced and at variance with Paul’s meaning, and understand it simply of excommunication. For <em>delivering over to Satan </em>is an appropriate expression for denoting excommunication; for as Christ reigns <em>in </em>the Church, so Satan reigns <em>out of </em>the Church, as Augustine, too, has remarked, <span class="cite-ref">(280)</span> in his sixty-eighth sermon on the words of the Apostle, where he explains this passage. <span class="cite-ref">(281)</span> As, then, we are received into the communion of the Church, and remain in it on this condition, that we are under the protection and guardianship of Christ, I say, that he who is cast out of the Church is in a manner delivered over to the power of Satan, for he becomes an alien, and is cast out of Christ’s kingdom. </p><p>The clause that follows, <em>for the destruction of the flesh</em>, is made use of for the purpose of softening; for Paul’s meaning is not that the person who is chastised is given over to Satan to be utterly ruined, or so as to be given up to the devil in perpetual bondage, but that it is a temporary condemnation, and not only so, but of such a nature as will be salutary. For as the salvation equally with the condemnation of the spirit is eternal, he takes the <em>condemnation of the flesh </em>as meaning <em>temporal </em>condemnation. “We will condemn him in this world for a time, that the Lord may preserve him in his kingdom.” This furnishes an answer to the objection, by which some endeavor to set aside this exposition, for as the sentence of excommunication is directed rather against the soul than against the outward man, they inquire how it can be called <em>the destruction of the flesh </em>My answer, then, is, (as I have already in part stated,) that the <em>destruction of the flesh </em>is opposed to <em>the salvation of the spirit</em>, simply because the former is temporal and the latter is eternal. In this sense the Apostle in <span class="bvs">Heb_5:7</span>, uses the expression <em>the days of Christ </em>’<em>s flesh</em>, to mean the course of his mortal life. Now the Church in chastising offenders with severity, spares them not in this world, in order that God may spare them. <span class="cite-ref">(282)</span> Should any one wish to have anything farther in reference to the rite of excommunication, its causes, necessity, purposes, and limitation, let him consult my Institutes. <span class="cite-ref">(283)</span></p><p><strong>(280)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">L’a tres-bien note</span>;” — “Has very well remarked.” </p><p><strong>(281)</strong> “The reader will find the same sentiment quoted in the <em>Institutes</em>, volume 3. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(282)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais c’est afin que Dieu leur espargne</span>;” — “But it is in order that God may spare them.” </p><p><strong>(283)</strong> See <em>Institutes</em>, volume 3. </p></div>
