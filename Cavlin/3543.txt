<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>And if ye will not yet for all this hearken</em>. The gradation of punishments, which is here mentioned, shews that they are so tempered by God’s kindness, that He only lightly chastises those whose stupidity or hardness of heart he has not yet proved; but when obstinacy in sin is superadded, the severity of the punishments is likewise increased; and justly so, because those who, being admonished, care not to repent, wage open war with God. Hence the more moderately He deals with us, the more attentive we ought to be to His corrections, in order that even the gentle strokes, which He in His kindness softens and tempers, may be enough. Paul says that hypocrites heap up to themselves a treasure of greater vengeance, if they take occasion from His forbearance to continue unmoved, ( <span class="bvs">Rom_2:4</span>;) for those who do not repent, when admonished by light chastisements, are the less excusable. Wherefore let us give heed to that exhortation of David, that we “be not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle;” because “many sorrows shall be to the wicked.” ( <span class="bvs">Psa_32:9</span>.) In sum, as soon as God has begun to put forth His hand to smite us, there is one remedy whereby He may be appeased, <em>i e</em>. , teachableness. It would be more prudent of us to anticipate Him, and to return to Him of our own accord, though He should withhold punishment; but when we are smitten without profit, it is a sin of obstinate wickedness. He threatens, therefore, that unless they repent when smitten with the ferule, He will use the rod to correct them. When He says, “I will punish you seven times more,” He does not mean to define the number, but, according to the common phrase of Scripture, uses the number seven, by way of amplification. In the next verse He shews that there is a just cause for His becoming more severe, because they cannot be subdued except by violent means; for although the word <span class="lang he-il">גאון</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(225)</span><em>geon</em>, is not always used in a bad sense, still, in this passage, it signifies that they are disobedient, being puffed up to be proud by their power; for, as Moses says elsewhere, Israel “waxed fat, and kicked” against God, just as horses grow restive by being overfed. He therefore calls their obstinacy, wherein they became more hardened, although God spared them, “the pride of their power;” for prosperity begets security, in which stubborn men try their strength against the scourges of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(225)</span> “Applied to <em>men</em>, it signifies superior honor, virtue; excellency, lustre; or pride, arrogance, haughtiness.” Taylor’s Concordance, <em>in voce</em>, <span class="lang he-il">גאה</span></p></div></div>
