<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_13:11</span><strong>.</strong><em>Neither premeditate. </em>This sentence, as well as the one which immediately follows, we have explained <span class="cite-ref">(131)</span> under <span class="bvs">Mat_10:19</span> Our Lordâ€™s design in these words is, to relieve the disciples from that anxiety which interferes with the cheerful discharge of our duty, when we doubt our inability to sustain the burden. Not that he wishes us to fall asleep in indolent security, for nothing is more advantageous than to have such a consciousness of our weakness as produces humility and excites to prayer. But Christ advises us to cast all our cares into the bosom of our Father, so that, relying on his promised aid, we may pursue our course with cheerfulness. The promise is stated in different words by Luke; not that Christ will deliver his people from death, (for this must not always be expected,) but that <em>he will give them a mouth and wisdom, </em>to confound their adversaries. Now though Christ supplies them both with presence of mind and with ability to speak, yet I look upon these two words as connected by that figure of speech which is called <em>hypallage; </em>as if Christ had promised that he would guide their tongues, so as to enable them to make a wise and suitable reply. </p><p>He adds, that this <em>wisdom </em>will be victorious against all their enemies, because <em>they will not be able to contradict, or to oppose it. </em>Not that their impudence will yield the palm to truth, but because that truth, which they in vain strive to oppose, will triumph over their mad presumption. Would that all who are called upon to make a confession of their faith would rely on that assurance; for the power and majesty of the Spirit would be displayed in a different manner for overthrowing the ministers of Satan. Now that we are partly carried away by our own feelings, and, swelled with pride, rush on heedlessly, or advance farther than is proper, and partly confine ourselves within the limits of improper timidity, sad experience shows that we are deprived of the grace of God and the assistance of the Spirit. As Christ affirms, according to Matthew and Mark, that it is the Spirit of the Father that speaketh in us, (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:10</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_13:11</span>,) and here declares that <em>he will give a mouth, </em>we infer that it is His prerogative to fortify us <em>by the Spirit. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(131)</span><em>Harmony, </em>vol. 1, p.453. </p></div></div>
