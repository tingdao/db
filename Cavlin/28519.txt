<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>But I would wish you. </em>He returns to the <em>advice </em>which he had spoken of, (<span class="bvs">1Co_7:25</span>,) but had not as yet fully explained, and in the outset he pronounces, as he is wont, a commendation upon celibacy, and then afterwards allows every one the liberty of choosing what he may consider to suit him best. It is not, however, without good reason that he returns so frequently to proclaim the advantages of celibacy, for he saw that the burdens of matrimony were far from light. The man who can exempt himself from them, ought not to refuse such a benefit, and it is of advantage for those who resolve to marry, to be forewarned of those inconveniences, that they may not afterwards, on meeting with them unexpectedly, give way to despondency. This we see happens to many, for having promised themselves unmixed honey, on being disappointed in that expectation, they are very readily cast down by the slightest mishap. <span class="cite-ref">(429)</span> Let them know, therefore, in good time, what they have to expect, that they may be prepared to endure everything patiently. The meaning is this: “Marriage brings along with it hindrances, from which I should wish you to be free and exempt.” </p><p>As, however, he has previously made use of the term <em>trouble</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Co_7:28</span>,) and now makes mention of <em>cares </em>or <em>anxieties</em>, it may admit of doubt whether they have a different signification, or not. I am of opinion that the <em>trouble </em>referred to is what arises from things of a distressing nature, such as loss of children, widowhood, quarrels, and little differences, (as lawyers speak,) <span class="cite-ref">(430)</span> many occasions of dislike, faults of children, difficulty in bringing up a family, and the like. The <em>anxieties</em>, on the other hand, are, in my opinion, connected with things that are joyful, as for example marriage fooleries, jests, and other things with which married persons are taken up. <span class="cite-ref">(431)</span></p><p><em>He that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord. </em>Mark the kind of exemption from anxieties that he desires in behalf of Christians — that they may devote to the Lord all their thoughts and aims. This, he says, belongs to celibacy; and therefore he desires all to enjoy this liberty. He does not mean, however, that it is invariably so in unmarried life, as experience shows it to be quite otherwise in priests, monks, and nuns, than whose celibacy nothing can be conceived to be farther from God. Add to this the many base fornicators who abstain from marriage for the very purpose of having greater liberty for the indulgence of lust, and that their vice may not appear. Where there is <em>burning</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Co_7:9</span>,) no love of God can exist. But Paul’s meaning is this — that an unmarried person is free, and is not hindered from thinking of the things of God. The pious make use of this liberty. Others turn everything to their own destruction. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(429)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’ils puissent rencontrer</span>;” — “That they may meet with.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(430)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui sourdent entre le man et la femme</span>;” — “that arise between a husband and wife.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(431)</span> Our Author’s meaning is, that while <span class="lang el-gr">θλιψις</span> (trouble) invariably relates to what is of a distressing nature, <span class="lang el-gr">μεριμνα</span> (care) is applied to anything that <em>takes up </em>the attention of the mind. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
