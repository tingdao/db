<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>The disciple took her to his own home. </em>It is a token of the reverence due by a <em>disciple </em>to his master, that John so readily obeys the command of Christ. Hence also it is evident, that the Apostles had their families; for John could not have exercised hospitality towards the mother of Christ, or have <em>taken her to his own home, </em>if he had not had a house and a regular way of living. Those men, therefore, are fools, who think that the Apostles relinquished their property, and came to Christ naked and empty; but they are worse than fools, who make perfection to consist in beggary. </p></div>
