<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Wonder not at this. </em>We may be apt to think that he reasons inconclusively, in drawing from the last resurrection a confirmation of what he had said; for it is not an instance of greater power to raise up bodies than to raise up minds. I reply, it is not from the fact itself that he makes a comparison between the greater and the less, but from the opinion of men; for, being carnal, they admire nothing but what is outward and visible. Hence it arises that they pass by the resurrection of the soul with little concern, while the resurrection of the body excites in them greater admiration. Another effect produced by this gross stupidity of ours is, that those things which are perceived by the eyes have a more powerful influence in producing faith than those which can be received by faith alone. As he mentions the last day, that limitation — -and <em>now is </em>— is not again added, but he simply declares that the time will one day arrive. </p><p>But another objection springs up; for though believers expect the resurrection of bodies, yet they cannot rely on their knowledge of it, so as to conclude that souls are now rescued from death, because bodies will one day rise out of the graves. And among ungodly men, <span class="cite-ref">(103)</span> what would be reckoned more ridiculous than to prove a thing unknown (to use a common phrase) by a thing less known? I reply, Christ here boasts of his power over the reprobate, so as to testify that the Father has committed to him the full restoration of all things; as if he had said, “What I now tell you that I have commenced, I will one day finish before your eyes.” And, indeed, when Christ now, by the voice of his Gospel, quickens souls which had been sunk in perdition, it is a sort of preparation for the last resurrection. Again, as he includes the whole human race, he immediately makes a distinction between the elect and the reprobate. This division shows that the reprobate, as they are now summoned by the voice of Christ to come to judgment, will also, by the same voice, be dragged and brought to appear at his tribunal. </p><p>But why does he mention those only who are shut up<em>in graves, </em>as if others would not be partakers of the resurrection, whether they have been drowned, or devoured by wild beasts, or reduced to ashes? The answer is, that as the dead are commonly buried, by the figure of speech called <em>synecdoche</em>, he employs a part to denote all who are already dead. And this is more emphatic than if he had said simply, <em>the dead</em>; for those whom death already deprived of life and light the grave withdraws, as it were, from the world. </p><p><em>Shall hear his voice. </em>The <em>voice of the Son </em>means <em>the sound of the trumpet</em>, which will sound at the command by the power of Christ, (<span class="bvs">Mat_24:31</span>; <span class="bvs">1Co_15:52</span>.) For though an <em>angel </em>will be a herald or forerunner, (<span class="bvs">1Th_4:16</span>,) this does not hinder what is done by the authority of the Judge, and as it were in his own person, from being ascribed to himself. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(103)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Des contempteurs de Dieu et incredules</span>;” “with despisers of God and unbelievers.” </p></div></div>
