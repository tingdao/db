<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>A sweet odor of Christ </em>The metaphor which he had applied to the knowledge of Christ, he now transfers to the persons of the Apostles, but it is for the same reason. For as they are called the <em>light of the world, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_5:14</span>,) because they enlighten men by holding forth the torch of the gospel, and not as if they shone forth upon them with their own lustre; so they have the name of <em>odor, </em>not as if they emitted any fragrance of themselves, but because the doctrine which they bring is odoriferous, so that it can imbue the whole world with its delectable fragrance. <span class="cite-ref">(344)</span> It is certain, however, that this commendation is applicable to all the ministers of the gospel, because wherever there is a pure and unvarnished proclamation of the gospel, there will be found <em>there </em>the influence of that <em>odor, </em>of which Paul here speaks. At the same time, there is no doubt, that he speaks particularly of himself, and those that were like him, turning to his own commendation what slanderers imputed to him as a fault. For his being opposed by many, and exposed to the hatred of many, was the reason why they despised him. He, accordingly, replies, that faithful and upright ministers of the gospel have a sweet odor before God, not merely when they quicken souls by a wholesome savour, but also, when they bring destruction to unbelievers. Hence the gospel ought not to be less esteemed on that account. “Both odors,” says he, “are grateful to God — that by which the elect are refreshed unto salvation, and that from which the wicked receive a deadly shock.” </p><p>Here we have a remarkable passage, by which we are taught, that, whatever may be the issue of our preaching, it is, notwithstanding, well-pleasing to God, if the Gospel is preached, and our service will be acceptable to him; and also, that it does not detract in any degree from the dignity of the Gospel, that it does not do good to all; for God is glorified even in this, that the Gospel becomes an occasion of ruin to the wicked, nay, it must turn out so. If, however, this is a <em>sweet odor </em>to God, it ought to be so to us also, or in other words, it does not become us to be offended, if the preaching of the Gospel is not salutary to all; but on the contrary, let us reckon, that it is quite enough, if it advance the glory of God by bringing just condemnation upon the wicked. If, however, the heralds of the Gospel are in bad odor in the world, because their success does not in all respects come up to their desires, they have this choice consolation, that they waft to God the perfume of a sweet fragrance, and what is to the world an offensive smell, is a <em>sweet odor </em>to God and angels. <span class="cite-ref">(345)</span></p><p>The term <em>odor </em>is very emphatic. “Such is the influence of the Gospel in both respects, that it either quickens or kills, not merely by its taste, but by its very smell. Whatever it may be, it is never preached in vain, but has invariably an effect, either for life, or for death.” <span class="cite-ref">(346)</span> But it is asked, how this accords with the nature of the Gospel, which we shall find him, a little afterwards, calling the <em>ministry </em>of life? (<span class="bvs">2Co_3:6</span>.) The answer is easy: The Gospel is preached for salvation: this is what properly belongs to it; but believers alone are partakers of that salvation. In the mean time, its being an occasion of condemnation to unbelievers — that arises from their own fault. Thus </p><p>Christ came not into the world to condemn the world,<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_3:17</span>,) </p><p>for what need was there of this, inasmuch as without him we are all condemned? Yet he sends his apostles to <em>bind, </em>as well as to <em>loose, </em>and to <em>retain </em>sins, as well as <em>remit </em>them. (<span class="bvs">Mat_18:18</span>; <span class="bvs">Joh_20:23</span>.) He is the <em>light of the world, </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_8:12</span>,) but he blinds unbelievers. (<span class="bvs">Joh_9:39</span>.) He is a Rock, for a foundation, but he is also to many a stone of stumbling. <span class="cite-ref">(347)</span> (<span class="bvs">Isa_8:14</span>.) We must always, therefore, distinguish between the proper office of the Gospel, <span class="cite-ref">(348)</span> and the accidental one (so to speak) which must be imputed to the depravity of mankind, to which it is owing, that life to them is turned into death. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(344)</span> “Elsner and many other commentators think, with sufficient reason, that there is here an allusion to the perfumes that were usually censed during the triumphal processions of Roman conquerors. Plutarch, on an occasion of this kind, describes the streets and temples as being <span class="lang el-gr">θυμιαματων πληρει</span> ” — ‘full of incense,’ which might not improperly be called an odour of death to the vanquished, and of life to the conquerors. It is possible that in the following verses the Apostle further alludes to the different effects of strong perfumes, to cheer some, and to throw others into various disorders, according to the different dispositions they may be in to receive them. There is, perhaps, not equal foundation for another conjecture which has been offered, that the expression, causeth us to triumph in Christ, contains an allusion to the custom of victorious generals, who, in their triumphal processions, were wont to carry some of their relations with them in their chariot.” — <em>Illustrated Commentary</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(345)</span> “‘We are unto God a sweet <em>savor </em>(or <em>odour</em>, rather, as the word <span class="lang el-gr">ὀσμὴ</span> more properly signifies) of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the odour of death unto death; to the other, the odour of life unto life.’ And this lay with a mighty weight upon his spirit. O that ever we should be the savor of death unto death to any! Who is sufficient for these things! But whether of life or death, we are a sweet odour to God in Christ, as to both; when he sees the sincerity of our hearts, and how fain we would fetch souls out of the state of death into this life. So grateful and pleasant to him is the work effected of saving souls, that the attempt and desire of it is not ungrateful.“ — <em>Howe’s Works</em>, (Lond. 1834,) p.999. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(346)</span> “<em>We are the savor of death unto death</em>. It is probable that the language here used is borrowed from similar expressions which were common among the Jews. Thus in Debarim Rabba, section. 1. fol. 248, it is said, ‘As the bee brings some honey to the owner, but stings others; so it is with the words of the law.’ ‘They (the words of the law) are a <em>savor of life </em>to Israel, but <em>savor of death </em>to the people of this world.’ Thus in Taarieth, fol. 7:1, ‘Whoever gives attention to the law on account of the law itself, to him it becomes an <em>aromatic of life</em>, <span class="lang he-il">סם חיים</span> (<em>sam chiim</em>); but to him who does not attend to the law on account of the law itself, to him it becomes an <em>aromatic of death</em>, <span class="lang he-il">סם מות</span>,(<em>sam maveth</em>)’ — the idea of which is, that as medicines skilfully applied will heal, but if unskilfully applied will aggravate a disease, so it is with the words of the law. Again, ‘The word of the law which proceeds out of the mouth of God is an <em>odour of life </em>to the Israelites, but an odour of death to the Gentiles.’” — <em>Barnes</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(347)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De scandale et achoppement</span>;” — “Of offense and stumbling.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(348)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le propre et naturel office de l’Euangile</span>;” — “The proper and natural office of the Gospel.” </p></div></div>
