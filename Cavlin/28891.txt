<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>For the love of Christ. </em>The term <em>love </em>may be taken either in a <em>passive </em>signification, or in an <em>active. </em>I prefer the latter. For if we be not harder than iron, we cannot refrain from devoting ourselves entirely to Christ, when we consider what great love he exercised towards us, when he endured death in our stead. Paul, too, explains himself when he adds, that it is reasonable that we should <em>live to him, </em>being dead to ourselves. Hence, as he had previously stated: (<span class="bvs">2Co_5:11</span>,) that he was stirred up to duty by fear, inasmuch as an account was one day to be rendered by him, so he now brings forward another motive — that measureless love of Christ towards us, of which he had furnished us with an evidence in his death. “The knowledge,” I say, “of this love, ought to <em>constrain </em>our affections, that they may go in no other direction than that of loving him in return. </p><p>There is a metaphor <span class="cite-ref">(544)</span> implied in the word <em>constrain, </em>denoting that it is impossible but that every one that truly considers and ponders that wonderful love, which Christ has manifested towards us by his death, becomes, as it were, bound to him, and <em>constrained </em>by the closest tie, and devotes himself wholly to his service. </p><p><em>If one died for all. </em>This design is to be carefully kept in view — that <em>Christ died for us, that we might die to ourselves. </em>The exposition is also to be carefully noticed — that to <em>die to ourselves is to live to Christ; </em>or if you would have it at greater length, it is to renounce ourselves, that we may <em>live to Christ; </em>for Christ. redeemed us with this view — that he might have us under his authority, as his peculiar possession. Hence it follows that we are no longer our own masters. There is a similar passage in <span class="bvs">Rom_14:7</span>. At the same time, there are two things that are here brought forward separately — that we are dead in Christ, in order that all ambition and eagerness for distinction may be laid aside, and that it may be felt by us no hardship to be made as nothing; and farther, that we owe to Christ our life and death, because he has wholly bound us to himself. <span class="cite-ref">(545)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(544)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il y a vne metaphore et similitude</span>;” — “There is a metaphor and similitude.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(545)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource qu’il a tant fait pour nous, que nous sommes du tout... luy</span>;” — “Because he has done so much for us, that we are wholly his.” </p></div></div>
