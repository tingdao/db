And there is an implied contrast between the eternal name of God, and that immortality of renown which great men seem to acquire by their exploits. Human excellencies are eulogized in histories; with God it stands differently, for there is not a day in which he does not renew remembrance of his works, and cherish it by some present effect, so as indelibly to preserve it alive upon our minds. For the same reason he speaks of the <em>glorious brightness</em>, or beauty of his excellence, the better to raise in others a due admiration of it. <em>By the words of his wonderful works, </em>I consider that there is an allusion to the incomprehensible method of God’s works, for so many are the wonders that they overwhelm our senses. And we may infer from this, that the greatness of God is not that which lies concealed in his mysterious essence, and in subtle disputation upon which, to the neglect of his works, many have been chargeable with mere trifling, for true religion demands practical not speculative knowledge. Having said that he would <em>speak of</em>, or <em>meditate upon God’s works</em>, (for the Hebrew word, <span class="lang he-il">אשיחה</span>, <em>asichah</em>, as we have elsewhere seen, may be rendered either way,) he transfers his discourse to others, intimating, that there will always be some in the world to declare the righteousness, goodness, and wisdom of God, and that his divine excellencies are worthy of being sounded, with universal consent, by every tongue. And, should others desist and defraud God of the honor due to him, he declares that he would himself at least discharge his part, and, while they were silent, energetically set forth the praises of God. Some think, that <em>the might of his terrible works </em>is an expression to the same effect with what had been already stated. But it seems rather to denote the judgments of God against profane scoffers. </p></div>
