<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>52.</strong><em>Now we know. </em>The reprobate persist in their stupidity, and are not moved by promises any more than by threatenings; so that they can neither be led nor drawn to Christ. Some think that they slanderously torture his words, by using the expression,<em>taste of death</em>, which Christ had not used; but this appears to me to be groundless. I rather think that both of the phrases, <em>to taste of death </em>and <em>to see death</em>, were used by the Hebrews in the same sense; namely, <em>to die </em>But they are false interpreters in this respect, that they apply the spiritual doctrine of Christ to the body. No believer <em>shall see death</em>, because believers, <em>having been born again of incorruptible seed</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Pe_1:23</span>,) live even when they die; because, united to Christ their Head, they cannot be extinguished by death; because <em>death </em>is to them a passage into the heavenly kingdom; because </p><p>the Spirit, dwelling in them, is life on account of righteousness, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_8:10</span>,) </p><p>until he swallow up all that remains of death. But those men, being carnal, cannot perceive any deliverance from death, unless it appear manifestly in the body. And it is a disease too common in the world, that the greatest part of men care almost nothing about the grace of Christ, because they judge of it only by their carnal perception. That the same thing may not happen to us, we must arouse our minds, that they may discern spiritual life in the midst of death. </p></div>
