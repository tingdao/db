<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>I have in a figure transferred. </em>Hence we may infer, that it was not those who were attached to Paul that gave rise to parties, as <em>they</em>, assuredly, had not. been so instructed, but those who had through ambition given themselves up to vain teachers. <span class="cite-ref">(225)</span> But as he could more freely and less invidiously bring forward his own name, and that of his brethren, he preferred to point out in his own person the fault that existed in others. At the same time, he strikes a severe blow at the originators of the parties, and points his finger to the sources from which this deadly divorce took its rise. For he shows them, that if they had been satisfied with good teachers, they would have been exempted from this evil. <span class="cite-ref">(226)</span></p><p><em>That is us. </em>Some manuscripts have it “that in <em>you</em>. ” Both readings suit well, and their is no difference of meaning; for what Paul intends is this — “I have, for the sake of example, transferred these things to myself and Apollos, in order that you may transfer this example to yourselves.” “<em>Learn </em>then <em>in us</em>, ” that is, “in that example which I have placed before you in our person as in a mirror;” or, “<em>Learn in you</em>, ” that is, “apply this example to yourselves.” But what does he wish them to <em>learn </em>? <em>That no one be puffed up for his own teacher against another</em>, that is, that they be not lifted up with pride on account of their teachers, and do not abuse their names for the purpose of forming parties, and rending the Church asunder. Observe, too, that pride or haughtiness is the cause and commencement of all contentions, when every one, assuming to himself more than he is entitled to do, is eager to have others in subjection to him. </p><p>The clause <em>above what is written </em>may be explained in two ways — either as referring to Paul’s writings, or to the proofs from Scripture which he has brought forward. As this, however, is a matter of small moment, my readers may be left at liberty to take whichever they may prefer. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(225)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A ces docteurs pieins d’ostentation</span>;” — “To those teachers, full of ostentation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(226)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">S’ils se contentent de bons et fideles docteurs, ils seront hors de danger d’vn tel mal</span>;” — “If they had contented themselves with good and faithful teachers, they would have been beyond the risk of such an evil.” </p></div></div>
