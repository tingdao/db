<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And while he was sitting. </em>Mark mentions four disciples, <em>Peter, James, John, and Andrew </em>But neither he nor Luke states the matter so fully as Matthew; for they only say that the disciples inquired about the time of the destruction of <em>the temple, </em>and — as it was a thing difficult to be believed — what outward <em>sign </em>of it God would give from heaven. Matthew tells us that they inquired about the time of <em>Christ’s coming, and of the end of the world. </em>But it must be observed that, having believed from their infancy that the temple would stand till the end of time, and having this opinion deeply rooted in their minds, they did not suppose that, while the building <em>of the world </em>stood, the <em>temple </em>could fall to ruins. Accordingly, as soon as Christ said that <em>the temple </em>would be destroyed, their thoughts immediately turned to <em>the end of the world; </em>and—as one error leads to another—having been convinced that, as soon as the reign of Christ should commence, they would be in every respect happy, they leave warfare out of the account, and fly all at once to a triumph. They associate <em>the coming of Christ </em>and <em>the end of the world </em>as things inseparable from each other; and by <em>the end of the world </em>they mean the restoration of all things, so that nothing may be wanting to complete the happiness of the godly. </p><p>We now perceive that they leap at once to various questions, because they had given way to these foolish imaginations, that <em>the temple </em>could not fall without shaking the whole world; that the termination of the shadows of the Law, and of the whole world, would be the same; that it would be immediately followed by the exhibition of the glory of Christ’s kingdom, which would make the children of God perfectly happy; that a visible renovation of the world was at hand, which would instantly bring order out of a state of confusion. But above all, a foolish hope which they entertained, as to the immediate reign of Christ, drove them to hasten to the attainment of happiness and rest, without attending to the means. Just as, when they see that Christ is risen from the dead, (<span class="bvs">Act_1:6</span>,) they rush forward to grasp at that happiness, which is laid up for us in heaven, and which must be attained through faith and patience. </p><p>Now though our condition is different, because we have not been educated among the shadows of the Law, so as to be infatuated by that superstition of an earthly kingdom of Christ, yet scarcely one person in a hundred is to be found who does not labor under a very similar disease. For since all men naturally shrink from annoyances, combats, and every kind of cross, the dislike of these things urges them, without moderation and without hope, to rush forward unseasonably to the fruit of hope. Thus no man wishes to sow the seed, but all wish to reap the harvest before the season arrives. To return to <em>the disciples, </em>they had indeed formed in their minds some good seed of faith, but they do not wait till it arrive at maturity; and holding, at the same time, erroneous views, they confound the perfection of Christ’s reign with the commencement of it, and wish to enjoy on earth what they ought to seek for in heaven. </p></div>
