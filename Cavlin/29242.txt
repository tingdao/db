<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>But now in Christ Jesus. </em>We must either supply the verb, <em>now that ye have been received in Christ Jesus, </em>or connect the word <em>now </em>with the conclusion of the verse, <em>now through the blood of Christ, </em>â€” which will be a still clearer exposition. In either case, the meaning is, that the Ephesians, <em>who were far off </em>from God and from salvation, had been reconciled to God through Christ, and <em>made nigh by his blood; </em>for the blood of Christ has taken away <em>the enmity </em>which existed between them and God, and from being enemies hath made them sons. </p></div>
