<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>In God we will boast </em><span class="cite-ref">(136)</span><em>all the day </em>This is the conclusion of the first part of the psalm. To express the meaning in a few words, they acknowledge, that in all ages the goodness of God had been so great towards the children of Abraham, that it furnished them with continual matter of thanksgiving. As if the thing were still present to their view, they acknowledge that, without ceasing, they ought to give praise to God, because they had flourished and triumphed, not merely for one age, or a short period of time, but because they had continued to do so successively from age to age, <span class="cite-ref">(137)</span> for whatever prosperity had befallen them, they ascribe it to the grace of God. And, certainly, it is then that men experience from the prosperity which befalls them, a holy and a well-regulated joy, when it bursts forth in the praises of God. <span class="cite-ref">(138)</span> Let us then, in the first place, bear in mind that this verse relates to the time of joy and prosperity in which God manifested his favor towards his people; secondly, that the faithful here manifest that they are not ungrateful, inasmuch as, having laid aside all vain boasting, they confess that all the victories by which they had become great and renowned proceeded from God, and that it was by his power alone that they had hitherto continued to exist, and had been preserved in safety; and, thirdly, that it was not only once or twice that matter of joy had been afforded them, but that this existed for a long time, inasmuch as God had manifested towards them, during a long and uninterrupted period, divers proofs and tokens of his paternal favor, so that the continuance, and, so to speak, the long experience they had had of it, ought to have been the means of confirming their hope. </p><p><strong>(136)</strong> Hammond reads, “We have praised God.” He considers the preposition <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, <em>beth</em>, prefixed to the name of God, as a pleonasm. </p><p><strong>(137)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais que la chose a continue, d’aage en aage</span>.” —<em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(138)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand d’icelle ils entrent a rendre louanges a Dieu</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “When from it they are led to give praise to God.” </p></div>
