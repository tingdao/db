<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>149.</strong><em>Hear my voice, O Jehovah! according to thy mercy. </em>In the first place he declares, that the goodness of God was the only ground of his hope of being heard by him. Whatever blessings the saints may plead for in prayer, their opening argument must be the free and unmerited grace of God. Nor is the term <em>judgments </em><span class="cite-ref">(22)</span> in the second clause to be taken in a different sense. As God has revealed his goodness in his word, his word is the source from which we must derive our assurance of his goodness. The Prophet, then, sensible that he had need of the divine mercy, betook himself directly to the word, in which God, sweetly alluring men to himself, promises that his grace will be ready and open for all. That each, therefore, may be confidently persuaded that God will be merciful to him in particular, let him learn from the example of the Prophet to entreat God to show himself such as he has promised to be. Some expound the word <em>judgments </em>by <em>manner </em>or <em>custom</em>; <span class="cite-ref">(23)</span> because, God’s usual way is to deal graciously with all his people. I would not altogether reject this exposition; but I think it is harsh and foreign to the scope of the text, while the meaning which I have adduced comes out very naturally. Moreover, he desires <em>to be quickened, </em>to testify that even in the, midst of life he is dead, except in so far as he is sustained by the power of God. And assuredly, all who are duly acquainted with their own infirmity, esteeming their life as nothing, will crave to be quickened every moment. It is also to be added, that God often so exercised his servant, that with good reason he might send up his prayers, as it were, out of the sepulcher, to be restored from death to life. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(22)</span> By “judgments,” Calvin means “God’s Word,” as the reader will observe from what follows. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(23)</span> Walford translates, “Revive me, e Jehovah! according to thy wonted manner.” </p></div></div>
