<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Who is the image of the invisible God. </em>He mounts up higher in discoursing as to the glory of Christ. He calls him the <em>image of the invisible God, </em>meaning by this, that it is in him alone that God, who is otherwise invisible, is manifested to us, in accordance with what is said in <span class="bvs">Joh_1:18</span>, </p><p>— No man hath ever seen God: the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, hath himself manifested him to us. </p><p>I am well aware in what manner the ancients were accustomed to explain this; for having a contest to maintain with Arians, they insist upon the equality of the Son with the Father, and his (<span class="lang el-gr">ὁμοουσίαν</span>) <em>identity of essence</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(303)</span> while in the mean time they make no mention of what is the chief point — in what manner the Father makes himself known to us in Christ. As to Chrysostom’s laying the whole stress of his defense on the term<em>image, </em>by contending that the creature cannot be said to be the <em>image </em>of the Creator, it is excessively weak; nay more, it is set aside by Paul in <span class="bvs">1Co_11:7</span>, whose words are — <em>The man is the </em>IMAGE <em>and glory of God </em></p><p>That, therefore, we may not receive anything but what is solid, let us take notice, that the term <em>image </em>is not made use of in reference to essence, but has a reference to us; for Christ is called the <em>image of God </em>on this ground — that he makes God in a manner visible to us. At the same time, we gather also from this his (<span class="lang el-gr">ὁμοουσία</span>) identity of essence, for Christ would not truly represent God, if he were not the essential Word of God, inasmuch as the question here is not as to those things which by communication are suitable also to creatures, but the question is as to the perfect wisdom, goodness, righteousness, and power of God, for the representing of which no creature were competent. We shall have, therefore, in this term, a powerful weapon in opposition to the Arians, but, notwithstanding, we must begin with that reference <span class="cite-ref">(304)</span> that I have mentioned; we must not insist upon the essence alone. The sum is this — that God in himself, that is, in his naked majesty, is invisible, and that not to the eyes of the body merely, but also to the understandings of men, and that he is revealed to us in Christ alone, that we may behold him as in a mirror. For in Christ he shews us his righteousness, goodness, wisdom, power, in short, his entire self. We must, therefore, beware of seeking him elsewhere, for everything that would set itself off as a representation of God, apart from Christ, will be an idol. </p><p><em>The first-born of every creature. </em>The reason of this appellation is immediately added — <em>For in him all things are created</em>, as he is, three verses afterwards, called the <em>first-begotten from the dead</em>, because by him we all rise again. Hence, he is not called the <em>first-born</em>, simply on the ground of his having preceded all creatures in point of time, but because he was begotten by the Father, that they might be created by him, and that he might be, as it were, the substance or foundation of all things. It was then a foolish part that the Arians acted, who argued from this that he was, consequently, a creature. For what is here treated of is, not what he is in himself, but what he accomplishes in others. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(303)</span> See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 196, n. 1. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(304)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Relation et correspondance</span>;” — “Reference and correspondence.” </p></div></div>
