<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>The ancient and honorable, he is the head. </em>What he had spoken allegorically about <em>the head </em>and <em>the tail </em>he explains more plainly and without a figure. He says that the <em>heads </em>are the princes and nobles who had the charge of public affairs, and sat at the helm of the commonwealth. To these he adds the <em>false prophets</em>, and says that they are meant by <em>the tail</em>. But he explains only the first part of the verse, and says nothing about the <em>branch and reed</em>. The reason why he omitted them is easily explained. It is, because he intended to press hardest on those who were more heinous transgressors, and who led others to commit sin, in consequence of the influence which they obtained from their high rank. He gives to the prophets the name of <em>the tail</em>, not because they were mean and contemptible, as some think; but he intended to denote the lowest parts of the whole body. By <em>the head </em>he means magistrates and judges, and by <em>the tail </em>he means <em>false prophets</em>, because they deceive and impose upon men by falsehoods and hypocrisy, as if he had compared the one to lions or bears, and the other to foxes. </p><p>This passage warns us that we ought not to slumber in our sins, because wickedness and profligacy abound in all ranks, and no class of men is sound or uninfected; for the more that vices abound, so much the more will the wrath of God be kindled against the highest and the lowest. We ought, especially in the present day, amidst that pestilence of every kind of evils, to fear lest, when the wrath of God hath begun to burn, it may consume everything, high and low. </p></div>
