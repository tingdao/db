<div class="comment-content"><p>Here David says not only that their wicked devices were without success, but that, by the wonderful providence of God, the result was the very opposite of what had been contemplated. He sets this forth in the first place metaphorically, by employing the figure of <em>a pit and a ditch; </em>and then he expresses the same thing in simple terms without figure, declaring, that the <em>mischief intended for others returned upon the head of him who had devised it </em>There is no doubt that it was a common proverb among the Jews, He who hath digged a pit falleth into it; which they quoted when they meant to say, that wicked and crafty men are caught in the snares and traps which they have set for others, or that the contrivers of the ruin of others perish by their own devices. <span class="cite-ref">(126)</span> There is a twofold use of this doctrine: the first place, however skilled in craft our enemies may be, and whatever means of doing mischief they may have, we must nevertheless look for the issue which God here promises, that they shall fall by their own sword. And this is not a thing which happens by chance; but God, by the secret direction of his own hand, causes the evil which they intend to bring upon the innocent to return upon their own heads. In the second place, If at any time we are instigated by passion to inflict any injury upon our neighbours, or to commit any wickedness, let us remember this principle of retributive justice, which is often acted upon by the divine government, that those who prepare a pit for others are cast into it themselves; and the effect will be, that every one, in proportion as he would consult his own happiness and welfare, will be careful to restrain himself from doing any injury, even the smallest, to another. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(126)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tomboyent au mal qu’ils avoyent brasse</span>.”—<em>Fr. </em>“Fall into the destruction which they had contrived.” </p></div></div>
