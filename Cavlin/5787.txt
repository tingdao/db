<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>For they are a nation void of counsel. </em>The cause is assigned why God had almost blotted out altogether the memory of the people, viz., because their faculty was incurable: for He does not merely indicate that their conduct was rash and inconsiderate, because they lacked reason mid discretion: but that they could be by no means brought to their senses, and, in fact, that not one drop of sagacity existed in them. The proof of this immediately follows, viz., that the tokens of God’s wrath were too clearly set before their eyes to escape their notice, unless they were utterly blind and stupid. The word <span class="lang he-il">לו</span>, <em>lu, </em>which they render, “Would that” <span class="cite-ref">(278)</span> (<em>utinam</em>,) denotes commiseration rather than desire; and therefore it may be properly translated, “Oh<em>, </em>if they understood,” etc. </p><p>By the expression, “latter<em>, </em>” their exceeding stupidity is censured: since not even by many and long experiences were they aroused to reflect on the causes of their calamities; whereas length of time extorts some sense at last from the very dullest, and almost idiotic persons. It was, therefore, a sign of desperate stupidity that they were still without understanding after so many years; as if by experience itself they had grown callous, when they ought to have shaken off their lethargy, and to have bestirred themselves to earnest inquiry. Justly, then, does Moses reproach them with not having considered even at the latter end; for not once only, nor in a single year, but by constant inflictions of punishment during a long series of years, had they been instructed without profit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(278)</span> So S.M. “O that.” — <em>A.
