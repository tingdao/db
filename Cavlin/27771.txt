<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Seeing we live in great peace. </em>Tertullus useth a preface nothing appertinent to the matter; because he commendeth Felix wisdom and virtues that he may purchase favor. Therefore it is a filthy and flattering <em>exordium. </em>Not that I am of their mind who reprehend Tertullus for speaking the judge fair, and for seeking to win his favor. For it is not always disagreeing with the right and lawful form of pleading to commend the judge; and there may reasons be brought on both sides (as they say) touching this matter. But I mislike nothing but this which is altogether corrupt. For the rhetorician doth insinuate himself under false praises, that he may darken the matter which is called in question. For to what end doth he speak of peace and a well ordered state, save only that Felix may think that the safety of Judea consisteth in condemning Paul, and that he may examine the matter no further? Moreover, it appeareth by Josephus, how covetously, cruelly, and voluptuously, Felix behaved himself in that province. The unworthy and tragical murdering of the highest priest, Jonathas, because he set himself against his dissolute tyranny, was already past;<span class="cite-ref">(564)</span> and, finally, almost at the very same time, Claudius Caesar was enforced with the complaints of the whole nation, to put Festus in his place, and to call him to answer for himself.</p><p>Therefore we see how shamefully this orator did lie. And seeing all Paul’s adversaries sing the same song, we see that they be blinded with hatred and malice, and that they treacherously betray the state of their country; neither do they pass what befall them so Paul may die the death.</p><p>Where Erasmus translateth it, <em>Many things are well done, </em>the old interpreter seemeth to come nearer unto Paul’s meaning, who saith, that <span class="lang el-gr">κατορθωματα</span> are wrought, which signifieth as much as <em>reformations </em>or <em>dressings. </em>Therefore Tertullus commendeth the industry of Felix, because he had cleansed Judea from many corruptions, and he restored many things which would otherwise have decayed;<span class="cite-ref">(565)</span> to wit, to the end he may the more greedily seek to purchase the favor of the nation (which he knew was otherwise offended with him) by the death of one man.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(564)</span></p><p>“ Jam praecesserat,” had already been committed. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(565)</span></p><p>“ Quae alioqui pessum ibant,” which were otherwise becoming worse. </p></div></div>
