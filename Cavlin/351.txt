<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>When Abram heard that his brother was taken captive</em>. Moses briefly explains the cause of the war which was undertaken; namely, that Abram might rescue his relation from captivity. Meanwhile, what I have before said is to be remembered, that he did not rashly fly to arms; but took them as from the hand of God, who had constituted him lord of that land. With reference to the words themselves, I know not why the ancient interpreter has rendered them, ‘Abram numbered his trained servants.’ For the word <span class="lang he-il">ריק</span> (<em>rik</em>) signifies to unsheathe, or to draw out. <span class="cite-ref">(359)</span> Now Moses calls these servants <span class="lang he-il">חניכים</span> (<em>chanichim</em>,) not as having been educated and trained for military service, as many suppose; but rather (in my opinion) as having been brought up under his own authority, and imbued from childhood with his discipline; so that they fought the more courageously, being stimulated by his faith, and going forth under his auspices; <span class="cite-ref">(360)</span> and were ready to undergo every kind of danger for his sake. But in this great household troop, we must notice, not only the diligence of the holy patriarch, but the special blessing of God, by which it had been increased beyond the common and usual manner. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(359)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Comme s’il disoit, Il tira hors de sa maison trois cens dixhuit serviteurs</span>.” — “As if he had said, He drew out of his house three hundred and eighteen servants.” — <em>French Tr </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(360)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Animosius sub fide et auspiciis ejus bellarent.” </p></div></div>
