<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>He was moved with compassion towards them. </em>The other two Evangelists, and particularly Mark, state more clearly the reason why this <em>compassion </em>( <span class="lang el-gr">συμπάθεια</span>) was awakened in the mind of Christ. It was because he saw famishing souls, whom the warmth of zeal had carried away from their homes and led into a <em>desert place </em>This scarcity of teaching indicated a wretched state of disorder; and accordingly Mark says that <em>Jesus was moved with compassion towards them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd </em>Not that, as to his Divine nature, he looked upon them all as sheep, but that, as man, he judged according to the present aspect of the case. It was no small manifestation of piety that they left their own homes, and flocked in crowds to the Prophet of God, though he purposely concealed himself from them. Besides, it ought to be remarked, that Christ was mindful of the character which he sustained; for he had been commanded to discharge the duties of a public teacher, and was therefore bound to look upon all the Jews, for the time being, as belonging to the flock of God and to the Church, till they withdrew from it. </p><p>So strongly was Christ moved by this feeling of <em>compassion, </em>that though, in common with his disciples, he was fatigued and almost worn out by uninterrupted toil, he did not spare himself. He had endeavored to obtain some relaxation, and that on his own account as well as for the sake of his disciples; but when urgent duty calls him to additional labor, he willingly lays aside that private consideration, <span class="cite-ref">(377)</span> and devotes himself to teaching the multitudes. Although he has now laid aside those feelings which belonged to him as a mortal man, yet there is no reason to doubt that he looks down from heaven on poor sheep that have no shepherd, provided they ask relief of their wants. Mark says, that <em>he began to teach them MANY things; </em>that is, he spent a long time in preaching, that they might reap some lasting advantage. Luke says, that he <em>spoke to them concerning the Kingdom of God, </em>which amounts to the same thing. Matthew makes no mention of any thing but miracles, because they were of great importance in establishing Christ’s reputation; but it may naturally be concluded that he did not leave out doctrine, which was a matter of the highest importance. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(377)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mettant arriere ceste consideration particuliere de donner repos au corps</span>;”— “setting aside that private consideration of giving rest to the body.” </p></div></div>
