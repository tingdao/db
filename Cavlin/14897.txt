<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>Let the people praise thee, O God! </em>Having spoken of all nations participating in the saving knowledge of God, he next tells us that they would proclaim his goodness, and exhorts them to the exercise of gratitude. The repetition used clearly shows of itself that he alludes to an event of a new and unprecedented kind. Had the allusion been to some such manifestation of his favor as he ordinarily made to the Jews, we would not have looked for the same vehemency of expression. First he says, <em>Let the people praise thee; </em>then he adds, <em>Let all the people praise thee </em>Afterwards he repeats the exclamation once more. But he appropriately makes mention, between, of <em>rejoicing, </em>and the occasion there was for it, since it is impossible that we can praise God aright, unless our minds be tranquil and cheerful — unless, as persons reconciled to God, we are animated with the hope of salvation, and “the peace of God, which passeth all understanding,” reign in our hearts, (<span class="bvs">Phi_4:7</span>.) The cause assigned for joy plainly in itself points to the event of the calling of the Gentiles. The reference is not to that government of God which is general in its nature, but to that special and spiritual jurisdiction which he exercises over the Church, in which he cannot properly be said to govern any but such as he has gathered under his sway by the doctrine of his law. The word <em>righteousness </em>is inserted in commendation of his government. Language almost identical is used by Isaiah and Micah when they speak of the times in which the word of salvation would be diffused throughout all the earth, (<span class="bvs">Isa_11:4</span>; <span class="bvs">Mic_4:3</span>.) </p></div>
