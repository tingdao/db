<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Reach hither thy finger. </em>We have already spoken once about Christ’s entrance, and the form of salutation which he employed. When Christ so readily yields to the improper request of <em>Thomas, </em><span class="cite-ref">(218)</span> and, of his own accord, invites him to <em>feel his hands, and touch the wound of his side, </em>we learn from this how earnestly desirous he was to promote our faith and that of <em>Thomas; </em>for it was not to <em>Thomas </em>only, but to us also, that he looked, that nothing might be wanting which was necessary for confirming our faith. </p><p>The stupidity of Thomas was astonishing and monstrous; for he was not satisfied with merely beholding Christ out wished to have his hands also as witnesses of Christ’s resurrection. Thus he was not only obstinate, but also proud and contemptuous in his treatment of Christ. Now, at least, when he saw Christ, he ought to have been overwhelmed with shame and amazement; but, on the contrary, he boldly and fearlessly stretches forth his hand, as if he were not conscious of any guilt; for it may be readily inferred from the words of the Evangelist, that he did not repent before that he had convinced himself by touching. Thus it happens that, when we render to the word of God less honor than is due to it, there steals upon us, without our knowledge, a glowing obstinacy, which brings along with it a contempt of the word of God, and makes us lose all reverence for it. So much the more earnestly should we labor to restrain the wantonness of our mind, that none of us, by improperly indulging in contradiction, and extinguishing, as it were, the feeling of piety, may block up against ourselves the gate of faith. </p><p><em>My Lord and my God! </em>Thomas awakes at length, though late, and as persons who have been mentally deranged commonly do when they come to themselves, exclaims, in astonishment, <em>My Lord and my God! </em>For the abruptness of the language has great vehemence; nor can it be doubted that shame compelled him to break out into this expression, in order to condemn his own stupidity. Besides, so sudden an exclamation shows that faith was not wholly extinguished in him, though it had been choked; for in the side or hands of Christ he does not handle Christ’s Divinity, but from those signs he infers much more than they exhibited. Whence comes this, but because, after forgetfulness and deep sleep, he suddenly comes to himself? This shows, therefore, the truth of what I said a little ago, that the faith which appeared to be destroyed was, as it were, concealed and buried in his heart. </p><p>The same thing happens sometimes with many persons; for they grow wanton for a time, as if they had cast off all fear of God, so that there appears to be no longer any faith in them; but as soon as God has chastised them with a rod, the rebellion of their flesh is subdued, and they return to their right senses. It is certain that disease would not, of itself, be sufficient to teach piety; and hence we infer, that, when the obstructions have been removed, the good seed, which had been concealed and crushed, springs up. We have a striking instance of this in David; for, so long as he is permitted to gratify his lust, we see how he indulges without restraint. Every person would have thought that, at that time, faith had been altogether banished from his mind; and yet, by a short exhortation of the Prophet, he is so suddenly recalled to life, that it may easily be inferred, that some spark, though it had been choked, still remained in his mind, and speedily burst into a flame. So far as relates to the men themselves, they are as guilty as if’ they had renounced faith and all the grace of the Holy Spirit; but the infinite goodness of God prevents the elect from falling so low as to be entirely alienated from God. We ought, therefore, to be most zealously on our guard not to fall from faith; and yet we ought to believe that God restrains his elect by secret bridle, that they may not fall to their destruction, and that He always cherishes miraculously in their hearts some sparks of faith, which he afterwards, at the proper time, kindles anew by the breath of his Spirit. </p><p>There are two clauses in this confession. <em>Thomas </em>acknowledges that Christ is <em>his Lord, </em>and then, in the second clauses, <span class="cite-ref">(219)</span> he ascends higher, and calls him also <em>his God. </em>We know in what sense Scripture gives to Christ the name of <em>Lord. </em>It is, because the rather hath appointed him to be the highest governor, that he may hold all things under his dominion., <em>that every knee may bow before him, </em>(<span class="bvs">Phi_2:10</span>,) and., in short, that he may be the Father’s vicegerent in governing the world. Thus the name <em>Lord </em>properly belongs to him, so far as he is the Mediator manifested in the flesh, and the Head of the Church. But <em>Thomas, </em>having acknowledged him to be <em>Lord, </em>is immediately carried upwards to his eternal Divinity, and justly; for the reason why Christ descended to us, and first was humbled, and afterwards was placed at the Father’s right hand, and obtained dominion over heaven and earth, was, that he might exalt us to his own Divine glory, and to the glory of the Father. That our faith may arrive at the eternal Divinity of Christ., we must begin with that knowledge which is nearer and more easily acquired. Thus it has been justly said by some, that by Christ Man we are conducted to Christ God, because our faith makes such gradual progress that, perceiving Christ on earth, born in a stable, and hanging on a cross., it rises to the glory of his resurrection, and, proceeding onwards, comes at length to his eternal life and power, in which his Divine Majesty is gloriously displayed. </p><p>Yet we ought to believe, that we cannot know Christ as <em>our Lord, </em>in a proper manner, without immediately obtaining also a knowledge of his Divinity. Nor is there any room to doubt that this ought to be a confession common to all believers., when we perceive that it is approved by Christ. He certainly would never have endured that the Father should be robbed of the honour due to him, and that this honor should be falsely and groundlessly conveyed to himself. But he plainly ratifies what Thomas said; and, therefore, this passage is abundantly sufficient for refuting the madness of Arius; for it is not lawful to imagine two Gods. Here also is declared the unity of person in Christ; for the same Jesus Christ <span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> is called both <em>God </em>and <em>Lord. </em>Emphatically, to, he twice calls him <em>his own, </em>MY<em>Lord and </em>MY <em>God! </em>declaring, that he speaks in earnest, and with a lively sentiment of faith. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(218)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce qu’il avoit demande par l’obstination et l’opiniastrete</span>;” — “what he had asked through obstinacy and stubbornness.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(219)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Au second membre</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(220)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Un mesme Jesus Christ</span>.” </p></div></div>
