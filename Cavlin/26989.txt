<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>And with many </em>Although in these things which we have had hitherto, Luke did not recite the words of St Peter, but did only briefly touch the chief points; notwithstanding he telleth us again in this place, that Peter did not use doctrine only, but did add the pricks of exhortations. And he expresseth plainly that tie stood much <span class="cite-ref">(131)</span> hereupon. Whereas he saith, that he did exhort and beseech, he noteth therein his earnestness. For it was not so easy a matter for them by and by <span class="cite-ref">(132)</span> to take their leave of those errors wherewith they were of late infected, and to shake off the government of the priests whereunto they were accustomed. Therefore it stood him upon to pull them violently out of this mire. The sum was this, that they should beware of that froward generation. For they could not be Christ’s unless they would depart from his professed enemies. The priests and scribes were then in great authority, and forasmuch as they did cover themselves under the visor [mask] of the Church, they did deceive the simple, this did hinder and keep back a great many from coming to Christ. Also some might waver, and other some might fall away from the right faith. Therefore Peter plainly declareth that they are a froward generation, howsoever they may boast of the title of the Church. For which cause he commandeth his hearers to separate themselves from them, lest they entangle themselves in their wicked and pestiferous fellowship. Whereas he saith, Be ye saved, he signifieth unto them that they shall surely perish if they couple themselves with such a plague. And surely experience doth teach us, how miserably those men are tossed to and fro who cannot discern the voice of their pastor from the voice of other men; <span class="cite-ref">(133)</span> and again, what an hindrance softness and sluggishness is to a great many, whilst they desire to stand in a doubt. <span class="cite-ref">(134)</span> Therefore he commandeth them to depart from the wicked if they will be saved. And this point of doctrine is not to be neglected. For it were not sufficient to have Christ set before us, unless we were also taught to flee those things which do lead us away from him. And it is the duty of a good shepherd to defend his sheep from the wolves. So at this day, to the end we may keep the people in the sincere doctrine of the gospel, we are ever now and then enforced to show and testify how much Papistry differeth from Christianity, and what a hurtful plague it is to be yoked with the unfaithful enemies of Christ. Neither ought Peter to be accused of railing, because he calleth the reverend 6tthers, who had the government of the Church <span class="cite-ref">(135)</span> in their hands at that day, a <em>froward generation </em>For those dangers which may draw the soul unto destruction are to be showed by their names. For men will not beware of poison, unless they know that it is poison. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(131)</span> “Multum institisse.” insisted much. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(132)</span> “Protinus,” forthwith. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(133)</span> “Alienorum,” of strangers or aliens. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(134)</span> “Medii stare,” to hold a middle course, remain undecided. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(135)</span> “Ordinarium Ecclesiae regimen,” the ordinary government of the Church. </p></div></div>
