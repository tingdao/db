<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Also in the day of thefirst-fruits. </em>Moses delivers the same commandment as to another festival, viz., that on which they offered their first-fruits. Then, also, he instructs them, the continual sacrifice was to be increased by the addition of two bullocks, one ram, seven lambs, a goat for a sin-offering, together with the <em>minha </em>and a libation, with the object, of which I have already spoken. A perplexing difficulty here arises, because in <span class="bvs">Lev_23:0</span>, one bullock is mentioned instead of two, and, on the contrary, two rams instead of one. <span class="cite-ref">(238)</span> Some think that an option was left to the priests in this matter; but when I consider how precisely God’s commands were given in everything, I question whether such an alternative was left to their discretion. The notion that God had once been content with a single bullock, as some think, because they were not abundant in the desert, appears to me a subterfuge. I confess I do not know how to get out of this difficulty, unless perhaps we say, that inasmuch as sufficiently exact provision had been made, in all other particulars, that nothing should be done without reason, in this respect only they were reminded that God in Himself cares not for greater or less victims. Nor does any reverence prevent us from saying that, as it sometimes happens in minor matters, a wrong number may have crept in from the carelessness of scribes; <span class="cite-ref">(239)</span> and this is probably the most natural solution. The more correct reading, in my opinion, is, that they should offer two bullocks and one ram; but since it is elsewhere explained why God appointed this day, he only briefly recites here: “When they bring the <em>fainha </em>with the first-fruits." </p><p><strong>(238)</strong> “Josephus and Maimonides understand that they were distinct sacrifices. Aben-Ezra and others think that it was left to the priest which he would offer.” — Brightwell on the Pentateuch, <em>in loco</em>. </p><p><strong>(239)</strong> The conjecture of <em>C. </em>receives no support from the modern collections of various readings; for though the number <em>two </em>is wanting in one of Kennicott’s <em>MSS., </em>the word for bullocks is in the plural in that same <em>MS.; </em>and the two most ancient versions, viz., the <em>LXX. </em>and the <em>Syriac </em>agree with the received text both here and in <span class="bvs">Lev_23:8</span>. — <em>W. </em></p></div>
