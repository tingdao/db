<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14</strong><em>If any one obeys not</em>. He has already declared previously, that he commands nothing but <em>from the Lord</em>. Hence the man, that would not obey, would not be contumacious against a mere man, but would be rebellious against God himself; <span class="cite-ref">(727)</span> and accordingly he teaches that such persons ought to be severely chastised. And, in the <em>first </em>place, he desires that they be reported to him, that he may repress them by his authority; and, <em>secondly</em>, he orders them to be excommunicated, that, being touched with shame, they may repent. From this we infer, that we must not spare the reputation of those who cannot be arrested otherwise than by their faults being exposed; but we must take care to make known their distempers to the physician, that he may make it his endeavor to cure them. </p><p><em>Keep no company</em>. I have no doubt that he refers to excommunication; for, besides that the (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀταξία</span>) <em>disorder </em>to which he had adverted deserved a severe chastisement, contumacy is an intolerable vice. He had said before, <em>Withdraw yourselves from them</em>, for they live in a <em>disorderly </em>manner, (<span class="bvs">2Th_3:6</span>.) And now he says, <em>Keep no company</em>, for they reject my admonition. He expresses, therefore, something more by this second manner of expression than by the former; for it is one thing to withdraw from intimate acquaintance with an individual, and quite another to keep altogether aloof from his society. In short, those that do not obey after being admonished, he excludes from the common society of believers. By this we are taught that we must employ the discipline of excommunication against all the obstinate <span class="cite-ref">(728)</span> persons who will not otherwise allow themselves to be brought under subjection, and must be branded with disgrace, until, having been brought under and subdued, they learn to obey. </p><p><em>That he may be ashamed</em>. There are, it is true, other ends to be served by excommunication — that contagion may spread no farther, that the personal wickedness of one individual may not tend to the common disgrace of the Church, and that the example of severity may induce others to <em>fear</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Ti_5:20</span>;) but Paul touches upon this one merely — that those who have sinned may by shame be constrained to repentance. For those that please themselves in their vices become more and more obstinate: thus sin is nourished by indulgence and dissimulation. This, therefore, is the best remedy — when a feeling of shame is awakened in the mind of the offender, so that he begins to be displeased with himself. It would, indeed, be a small point gained to have individuals made ashamed; but Paul had an eye to farther progress — when the offender, confounded by a discovery of his own baseness, is led in this way to a full amendment: for shame, like sorrow, is a useful preparation for hatred of sin. Hence all that become wanton <span class="cite-ref">(729)</span> must, as I have said, be restrained by this bridle, lest their audacity should be increased in consequence of impunity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(727)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce n’eust point contre vn homme mortel qu’il eust addresse son opiniastre et rebellion</span>;” — “It would not have been against a mortal man that he had directed his stubbornness and rebellion.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(728)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et endurcis</span>;” — “And hardened.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(729)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tous ceux qui se desbordent et follastrent</span>;” — “All those that break out and become wanton.” </p></div></div>
