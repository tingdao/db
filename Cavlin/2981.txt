<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake </em>Moses restrains his brother from giving way to excessive grief; for this was a very bitter stroke after their recent joy to see himself at once deprived of two sons on the same day, and at the same moment, he might, too, have been disposed to murmur against God for the cause of their death. Lest, therefore, He should give way to such want of self-control, Moses reminds him that he must submit to the just judgment of God. We shall, however, seek in vain for what is here referred to, <span class="cite-ref">(416)</span> “I will be glorified in them that come nigh me.” He had often threatened the priests witlt death if they departed in the least degree from the prescribed rule: He had often set before them the sacredness of their office, lest they should defile themselves by any sacrilegious act; in a word, He had chosen them to be His ministers in holy things, on the condition that they should know themselves to be subject to greater guilt and punishment than the rest of the people. By this consolation, then, Aaron’s grief is quieted, that God had not dealt cruelly with his sons, but had shewn forth in them a just and profitable example, in order that their successors might be more attentive in their duties; for thus should the sentence be paraphrased: In order that I may be glorified before the whole people, I must be sanctified by those of the highest degree and consequence; or, When I shall have been sanctified by the priests themselves, whose dignity is the highest, my glory will shine forth before the whole people. And, in point of fact, although God may punish whole bodies of obscure persons, such lessons have but little effect; but the punishment of men of more noble and illustrious condition draws almost all eyes to the judgments of God. For God is said to be sanctified in us in many ways, whether He shews Himself to be a pitiful or a severe Judge. This declaration, then, is an exhortation to those whom he has dignified with peculiar honor, to walk in fear and trembling; for, since “judgment begins at the house of God,” the greater are the gifts and the higher the pre-eminence is with which any one is blessed, the greater is his obligation to God, and his ingratitude worthy of severer punishment. </p><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And Aaron held his peace </em>Much is this silence of Aaron to be applauded, whereby he confessed that his sons were slain by the just judgment of God; for Moses indicates that he yielded to his admonition, and was thus restrained from complaining against. God. Thus Paul teaches us that Scripture is given to teach us patience. (<span class="bvs">Rom_15:4</span>.) Wherefore, whenever our passions are too much excited, let us learn that this is the best remedy for quieting and repressing them, to <em>submit ourselves to God, </em>and to <em>humble ourselves beneath his mighty hand. </em>David invites us to this by his own example when he says, </p><p>“I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_39:9</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(416)</span><em>A.

Some, as De Lyra, refer this to <span class="bvs">Exo_19:22</span>; Others to <span class="bvs">Exo_29:43</span>. “Some think it was spoken, but not written, as many things beside. <em>Oleaster, Lorinus, Caietan; </em>but,” adds Willet, “they are of this mind, that they may have here some show for their unwritten traditions. Therefore,” he concludes, “without any more circumstance, we find this to have been spoken, <span class="bvs">Lev_8:35</span>, ‘Keep ye the Lord’s charge, that ye die not;’ there they are commanded to observe the Lord’s ordinances, which he gave them, <em>(Junius;) </em>and because Nadab and Abihu did not so, they are punished with death.” </p></div></div>
