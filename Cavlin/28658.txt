<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>But God hath tempered the body together </em>He again repeats, what he had stated once before, (<span class="bvs">1Co_12:18</span>,) but more explicitly, — that God has appointed this symmetry, and that with a view to the advantage of the whole body, because it cannot otherwise maintain its standing. “For whence comes it, that all the members are of their own accord concerned for the honor of a less comely member, and agree together to conceal its shame? This inclination has been implanted in them by God, because without this adjustment <em>a schism in the body </em>would quickly break out. Hence it appears that the body is not merely shattered, and the order of nature perverted, but the authority of God is openly set at naught, whenever any one assumes more than belongs to him.” <span class="cite-ref">(760)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(760)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et que ne porte sa vocation</span>;” — “And does not keep within his calling.” </p></div></div>
