<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Have regard to thy covenant. </em>That God may be the more inclined to show mercy, the prophet brings to his remembrance the Divine covenant; even as the refuge of the saints, when they have found themselves involved in extreme dangers, has always been to hope for deliverance, because God had promised, in the covenant which he made with them, to be a father to then, From this we learn, that the only firm support on which our prayers can rest is, that God has adopted us to be his people by his free choice. Whence, also, it appears how devilish was the phrensy of that filthy dog Servetus, who was not ashamed to affirm that it is foolish, and gross mockery, to lay before God his own promises when we are engaged in prayer. Farther, the godly Jews again show us how severely they were afflicted, when they declare that violence and oppression were everywhere prevalent; as if all places were the haunts of cut-throats and the dens of robbers. <span class="cite-ref">(244)</span> It is said <em>the dark places of the earth; </em>for, whenever God seems to hide his face, the wicked imagine that whatever wickedness they may commit, they will find, wherever they may be, hiding-places by which to cover it all. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(244)</span> “The caves, dens, woods, etc., of the <em>land</em>, are full of robbers, cut-throats, and murderers, who are continually destroying thy people; so that the holy seed seems as if it would be entirely cut off, and the <em>covenant </em>promise thus rendered void.” — <em>Dr Adam Clarke</em>. “<em>For the dark places of the earth</em>, <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , the caverns of Judea, <em>are full of the habitations of violence</em>, <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , of men who live by rapine. Some, however, <em>by the dark places of the earth</em>, understand the seat of the captivity of the Jews.” — <em>Cresswell</em>. </p></div></div>
