<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Since by man came death </em>The point to be proved is, that Christ is the <em>first-fruits, </em>and that it was not merely as an individual that he was raised up from the dead. He proves it from contraries, because death is not from nature, but from man’s sin. As, therefore, Adam did not die for himself alone, but for us all, it follows, that Christ in like manner, who is the antitype, <span class="cite-ref">(50)</span> did not rise for himself alone; for he came, that he might restore everything that had been ruined in Adam. </p><p>We must observe, however, the force of the argument; for he does not contend by similitude, or by example, but has recourse to opposite causes for the purpose of proving opposite effects. The cause of death is Adam, and we die in him: hence Christ, whose office it is to restore to us what we lost in Adam, is the cause of life to us; and his resurrection is the ground-work and pledge of ours. And as the former was the beginning of death, so the latter is of life. In the fifth chapter of the Romans (<span class="bvs">Rom_5:0</span>) he follows out the same comparison; but there is this difference, that in that passage he reasons respecting a spiritual life and death, while he treats here of the resurrection of the body, which is the fruit of spiritual life. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(50)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le premier patron de la resurrection pour opposer a la mort d’ Adam</span>;” — “The first pattern of the resurrection, in opposition to the death of Adam.” </p></div></div>
