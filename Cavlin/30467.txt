<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>Feed the flock of God </em>We hence learn what the word <em>presbyter </em>imports, even that it includes the office of feeding. It is for a far different end that the Pope makes presbyters, even that they may daily slay Christ, there being no mention made of feeding in their ordination. Let us then remember to distinguish between the institution of Christ and the confusion of the Pope, it being as different as light is from darkness. Let us also bear in mind the definition given of the word; for the flock of Christ cannot be fed except with pure doctrine, which is alone our spiritual food. </p><p>Hence pastors are not mute hypocrites, nor those who spread their own figments, which, like deadly poison, destroy the souls of men. </p><p>The words, <em>as much as it is in you, </em>mean the same as though he had said, “Apply all your strength to this very thing, and whatever power God has conferred on you.” The old interpreter has given this rendering, “Which is among you;” and this may be the sense of the words: more correct, however, is the rendering of Erasmus, which I have followed, though I do not reject nor disapprove of the other. <span class="cite-ref">(54)</span></p><p><em>The flock of God, </em>or, <em>of the Lord</em>, or, <em>of Christ</em>: it matters little which you take, for the three readings are found in different copies. <span class="cite-ref">(55)</span></p><p><em>Taking the oversight, </em>or, <em>discharging the office of a bishop</em>. Erasmus renders the words, “Taking care of it,” (<em>curam illius agentes </em><em>;</em>) but as the Greek word is <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπισκοποῦντες</span> I doubt not but that Peter meant to set forth the office and title of the episcopate. We may learn also from other parts of Scripture that these two names, bishop and presbyter, are synonymous. He then shews how they were rightly to perform the pastoral office, though the word <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπισκοπεῖν</span> generally means to preside or to oversee. What I have rendered “not constraintally,” is literally, “not necessarily;” for when we act according to what necessity prescribes, we proceed in our work slowly and frigidly, as it were by constraint. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(54)</span> The <em>Vulgate, </em>called here and elsewhere, “the old interpreter,” seems to be the most correct, as viewed by most critics. The same form of words is found in the first verse, “The elders <em>who are among you</em>. ” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(55)</span> By far the most approved reading is “of God.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
