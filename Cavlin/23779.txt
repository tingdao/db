<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_19:16</span><strong>.</strong><em>And, lo, one. </em>Luke says that he was a <em>ruler</em>, ( <span class="lang el-gr">ἄρχων</span>,) that is, a man of very high authority, not one of the common people. <span class="cite-ref">(616)</span> And though riches procure respect, <span class="cite-ref">(617)</span> yet he appears to be here represented to have been held in high estimation as a good man. For my own part, after weighing all the circumstances, I have no doubt that, though he is called a <em>young man</em>, he belonged to the class of those who upheld the integrity of the <em>Elders</em>, by a sober and regular life. <span class="cite-ref">(618)</span> He did not come treacherously, as the scribes were wont to do, but from a desire of instruction; and, accordingly, both by words and by <em>kneeling</em>, he testifies his reverence for Christ as a faithful teacher. But, on the other hand, a blind confidence in his works hindered him from profiting under Christ, to whom, in other respects, he wished to be submissive. Thus, in our own day, we find some who are not ill-disposed, but who, under the influence of I know not what shadowy holiness, <span class="cite-ref">(619)</span> hardly relish the doctrine of the Gospel. </p><p>But, in order to form a more correct judgment of the meaning of the answer, we must attend to the form of the question. He does not simply ask how and by what means he shall reach <em>life</em>, but <em>what good thing he shall do, in order to obtain it. </em>He therefore dreams of merits, on account of which he may receive <em>eternal life </em>as a reward due; and therefore Christ appropriately sends him to the keeping of the law, which unquestionably is the way of <em>life</em>, as I shall explain more fully afterwards. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(616)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que c’estoit un prince ou seigneur; c’est a dire, un homme d’estat et de grande authorite</span>;” — “that he was a prince or lord; that is to say, a man of rank and of great authority.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(617)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien que les richesses rendent un homme honorable au monde</span>;” — “though riches render a man honorable in the world.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(618)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Non point par trahison, et pour surprendre Christ</span>;” — “not by treachery, and to take Christ by surprise.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(619)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource qu’ils sont enveloppez de ie ne scay quelle ombre de sainctete</span>;” — “because they are covered by I know not what shadow of holiness.” </p></div></div>
