<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Look at the fowls of the air </em>This is the remedy I spoke of, for teaching us to rely on the providence of God: for of all cares, which go beyond bounds, unbelief is the mother. The only cure for covetousness is to embrace the promises of God, by which he assures us that he will take care of us. In the same manner, the Apostle, wishing to withdraw believers from <em>covetousness, </em>confirms that doctrine: <em>for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee, </em>(<span class="bvs">Heb_13:5</span>.) The substance of the exhortation is, that we ought to trust in God, by whom none of his own people, however mean their condition may be, are disregarded. </p><p><em>Your heavenly Father feedeth them </em>This deserves careful attention: for, though we are unable to explain the manner in which their life is supported, which of us is in the habit of considering that their life depends on the providence of God, which he is pleased to extend even to them? But if it is thoroughly fixed in our minds, <em>that the fowls </em>are supplied with food by the hand of God, there will be no difficulty in expecting it for ourselves, who are formed after his image, and reckoned among his children. <em>They neither sow nor reap </em>By these words it is far from being our Lord’s intention to encourage us to indolence and sluggishness. All that he means is, that, though other means fail, the providence of God is alone sufficient for us, for it supplies the animals abundantly with every thing that they need. </p><p>Instead <em>of fowls, ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">τὰ πετεινὰ</span><em>,</em>) Luke uses the word <em>ravens, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">τοὺς κόρακας</span>,) alluding perhaps to that passage in the Psalms, <em>who giveth food to the young ravens that call upon him, </em>(<span class="bvs">Psa_67:0</span> : 9.) Some think that David expressly mentioned <em>the ravens, </em>because they are immediately deserted by their parents, <span class="cite-ref">(459)</span> and therefore must have their food brought to them by God. Hence it is evident, that Christ intended nothing more than to teach his people to throw all their cares on God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(459)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource que le pere et 1a mere les abandonnent incontinent qu'ils sont nais</span>;” — “because their parents forsake them as soon as they are born.” </p></div></div>
