<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil? </em>The Psalmist now enters upon the point on which he proposed to discourse, That the people of God must not yield to despondency even in the most distressing circumstances, when their enemies may seem to have enclosed them on every side, but must rest assured that God, although he connives for a time, is awake to their condition, and only watches the best opportunity of executing his judgments. This manner of introducing the subject by interrogation is much more emphatic than if he had simply asserted his resolution to preserve his mind undisturbed in the midst of adversity. In the second clause of the verse he particularises the heaviest and most bitter of all afflictions, those which are experienced by the righteous when their enemies triumph in the unrestrained indulgence of their wickedness. <em>When, </em>the adverb of time, must therefore be understood — <em>When the iniquity of my heel shall compass me about </em>There is a different meaning which some interpreters have attached to the words, namely, If I should fear in the days of evil, and be guilty of the excessive anxieties of the unbeliever, — in that case, when the hour of my death came, my iniquity would compass me about. <em>The heel </em>they take to be the end of life. But this interpretation is to be dismissed at once as most unnatural. Nor do I see what reason others have for referring this word to <em>the thoughts, </em>for I believe that in no other part of Scripture can such a metaphor or similitude be found. Others, with more plausibility, have rendered the original word <em>liers in wait, </em><span class="cite-ref">(217)</span> because the Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">עקב</span>, <em>akab, </em>signifies <em>to deceive; </em>and they consider the Psalmist as intimating, that he would not fear though crafty and treacherous men laid snares for him. In my opinion, there is no figure intended; and he means to say, that he would have no fear when his enemies surrounded him, and in pursuing him, trode, as it were, upon his heel. The French have a similar expression, “Poursuyvre jusques aux talons.” <span class="cite-ref">(218)</span> I agree with them, that he speaks of enemies, but it is of their wicked persecution as they press upon him in the height of their power, and with design to destroy him, keep themselves near him, and tread, so to speak, upon his very heel. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(217)</span> Lowth reads, “The wickedness of those who <em>lie in wait for me</em>, or endeavor to <em>supplant me</em>; ” and Horsley, “When the iniquity of <em>those who plot against me </em>environs me.” The original word is <span class="lang he-il">עקבי</span>, <em>akabey</em>, which Dr Adam Clarke thinks is to be considered as the contracted plural of <span class="lang he-il">עקבים</span>, <em>akabim</em>, <em>supplanters</em>, from <span class="lang he-il">עקב</span>, <em>akab</em>, <em>to supplant</em>, <em>to defraud </em>It is literally, “My Jacobs;” that is, those who would act towards me as Jacob acted towards Esau. See <span class="bvs">Gen_27:36</span>, and <span class="bvs">Jer_9:4</span>. The Syriac and Arabic versions read it, “My enemies.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(218)</span><em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. “To pursue even to the heels.” </p></div></div>
