<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>65.</strong><em>Therefore have I told you. </em>He again states that faith is an uncommon and remarkable gift of the Spirit of God, that we may not be astonished that the Gospel is not received in every place and by all. For, being ill qualified to turn to our advantage the course of events, we think more meanly of the Gospel, because the whole world does not assent to it. The thought arises in our mind, How is it possible that the greater part of men shall deliberately reject their salvation? Christ therefore assigns a reason why there are so few believers, namely, because no man, whatever may be his acuteness, <span class="cite-ref">(174)</span> can arrive at faith by his own sagacity; for all are blind, until they are illuminated by the Spirit of God, and therefore they only partake of so great a blessing whom the Father deigns to make partakers of it. If this grace were bestowed on all without exception, it would have been unseasonable and inappropriate to have mentioned it in this passage; for we must understand that it was Christ’s design to show that not many believe the Gospel, because faith proceeds only from the secret revelation of the Spirit. </p><p><em>Unless it be given him by my Father. </em>He now uses the word <em>give </em>instead of the word which he formerly used, <em>draw</em>; by which he means that there is no other reason why God <em>draws</em>, than because out of free grace he loves us; for what we obtain by the gift and grace of God, no man procures for himself by his own industry. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(174)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tant aigu soit il</span>.” </p></div></div>
