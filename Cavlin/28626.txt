<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>For as often as ye shall eat. </em>Paul now adds what kind of remembrance ought to be cherished — that is, with thanksgiving; not that the remembrance consists wholly in confession with the mouth; for the chief thing is, that the efficacy of Christ’s death be sealed in our consciences; but this knowledge should stir us up to a confession in respect of praise, so as to declare before men what we feel inwardly before God. The Supper then is (so to speak) a kind of memorial, which must always remain in the Church, until the last coming of Christ; and it has been appointed for this purpose, that Christ may put us in mind of the benefit of his death, and that we may recognize it <span class="cite-ref">(697)</span> before men. Hence it has the name of the Eucharist. <span class="cite-ref">(698)</span> If, therefore, you would celebrate the Supper aright, you must bear in mind, that a profession of your faith is required from you. Hence we see how shamelessly those mock God, who boast that they have in the mass something of the nature of the Supper. For what is the mass? They confess (for I am not speaking of Papists, but of the pretended followers of Nicodemus) that it is full of abominable superstitions. By outward gesture they give a pretended approval of them. What kind of <em>showing forth of the death of Christ </em>is this? Do they not rather renounce it? </p><p><em>Until he come </em>As we always need a help of this kind, so long as we are in this world, Paul intimates that this commemoration has been given us in charge, until Christ come to judgment. For as he is not present with us in a visible form, it is necessary for us to have some symbol of his presence, by which our minds may exercise themselves. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(697)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que de nostre part le recognoissions</span>;” — “That we, on our part, may recognise it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(698)</span> From, <span class="lang el-gr">εὐχαριστήσας</span>, (<em>having given thanks</em>,) which is made use of by Paul, and also by the Evangelists, (see <em>Harmony</em>, vol. 3, p. 205, n. 1,) in their account of the original appointment of the Supper.
