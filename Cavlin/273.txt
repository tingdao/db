<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Behold, the people is one</em>. Some thus expound the words, that God complains of a wickedness in men so refractory, that he excites himself by righteous grief to execute vengeance; not that he is swayed by any passions, <span class="cite-ref">(329)</span> but to teach us that he is not negligent of human affairs, and that, as he watches for the salvation of the faithful, so he is intent on observing the wickedness of the ungodly; as it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_34:16</span>, </p><p>“The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.” </p><p>Others think there is a comparison between the less and the greater, no if it had been said, ‘They are hitherto few and only use one language; what will they not dare, if, on account of their multitude, they should become separated into various nations?’ But there rather seems to me to be a suppressed irony, as if God would propose to himself a difficult work in subduing their audacity: so that the sense may be, ‘This people is compacted together in a firm conspiracy, they communicate with each other in the same language, by what method therefore can they be broken?’ Nevertheless, he ironically smiles at their foolish and hasty confidence; because, while men are calculating upon their own strength, there is nothing which they do not arrogate to themselves. </p><p><em>This they begin to do</em>. In saying that they <em>begin</em>, he intimates that they make a diligent attempts accompanied with violent fervor, in carrying on the work. Thus in the way of concession, God declares, that supposing matters to be so arranged, there would be no interruption of the building. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(329)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Non quod in ipsum cadant ulli affectua.” </p></div></div>
