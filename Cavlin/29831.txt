<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>No man who warreth </em>He continues to make use of the metaphor which he had borrowed from warfare. Yet, strictly speaking, he formerly called Timothy “a soldier of Christ” metaphorically; but now he compares profane warfare with spiritual and Christian warfare in this sense. “The condition of military discipline is such, that as soon as a soldier has enrolled himself under a general, he leaves his house and all his affairs, and thinks of nothing but war; and in like manner, in order that we may be wholly devoted to Christ, we must be free from all the entanglements of this world.” </p><p><em>With the affairs of life </em>By “the affairs of life”, <span class="cite-ref">(159)</span> he means the care of governing his family, and ordinary occupations; as farmers leave their agriculture, and merchants their ships and merchandise, till they have completed the time that they agreed to serve in war. We must now apply the comparison to the present subject, that every one who wishes to fight under Christ must relinquish all the hindrances and employments of the world, and devote himself unreservedly to the warfare. In short, let us remember the old proverb, <em>Hoc age </em>, <span class="cite-ref">(160)</span> which means, that in the worship of God, we ought to give such earnestness of attention that nothing else should occupy our thoughts and feelings. The old translation has, “No man that fights for God,” etc. But this utterly destroys Paul’s meaning. </p><p>Here Paul speaks to the pastors of the Church in the person of Timothy. The statement is general, but is specially adapted to the ministers of the word. First, let them see what things are inconsistent within their office, that, freed from those things, they may follow Christ. Next, let them see, each for himself, what it is that draws them away from Christ; that this heavenly General may not have less authority over us than that which a mortal man claims for himself over heathen soldiers who have enrolled under him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(159)</span> “By <span class="lang el-gr">τοῦ βίου πραγματείαις</span> is meant the business of life in general, the plural being used with allusion to the various kinds thereof, as agriculture, trade, manufactures, etc. Now, by the Roman law, soldiers were excluded from <em>all </em>such. See Grotius.” — <em>Bloomfield </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(160)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Brief, qu’il nous souvienne du proverbe ancien duquel les Latins ont use en faisant leurs sacrifices</span>, Hoc <em>age </em>, <span class="lang fr-fr">c’est a dire, Fay ceci, ou, Pense a ceci, ascavoir que tu as entre mains, lequel signifie, que quand il est question du service de Dieu, il s’y faut tellement employer, que nous ne soyons ententifs ni affectionnez ailleurs</span>.” — “In short, let us remember the old proverb which the Latins used in offering their sacrifices, <em>Hoc age </em><em>, </em>that is to say, ‘Do this,’ or, ‘Think of this,’ ‘Do (or think of) what thou hast in hand,’ which means, that when the worship of God is the matter in question, we must be employed in it in such a manner that we shall not give our attention or our heart to anything else.” </p></div></div>
