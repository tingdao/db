<div class="comment-content"><p>Here he mentions the second part of the blessing; for the whole people would be preserved safe in the possession of their kingdom and priesthood, as in both the favor of God appeared; for both the king and the priest were types of Christ. For as by the priesthood they knew that God was propitious to them, they being reconciled to him by sacrifices, and as by the kingdom they knew that God was the protector and guardian of their safety, so these two things constituted a real and complete happiness. Hence the Prophet, having mentioned one of these things, now proceeds to the other, — </p><p><em>They shall come from the cities of Judah ad from the whole circuit of Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin</em>, and from other places, to offer sacrifices in the Temple. Sacrifices of themselves could not indeed serve the people; but Jeremiah assumed this principle, — that reconciliation was not in vain promised to the people by the sacrifices; for sins were really atoned, and Godas it were came forth to gather a people for himself. It was the same as though God said, that he would by all means be gracious to them, if only they observed the Sabbath, that is, if they with a pure heart devoted themselves to his service. The country, as I have said, was in a great measure laid waste; but the Prophet, after having spoken of the city, now adds, that all Judea would become inhabited, for from thence they would ascend to the Temple to offer sacrifices. After having mentioned the whole circuit, he names the <em>land of Benjamin</em>, the half tribe of whom, as it is well known, had continued in the faith, and had not separated from the family of David; indeed a part of the city was in the tribe of Benjamin. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>the plain and the mountains</em>, as though he had said, God’s worshippers would come from all the neighboring region to celebrate the feasts and to offer sacrifices as usual. </p><p>At last he mentions <em>burnt-offering, sacrifice, and oblation</em>, <span class="lang he-il">מנחה</span>, <em>meneche</em>; the three principal offerings. But Jeremiah wished to shew briefiy that God would cause religion to flourish and prevail among them as before. But after having spoken of the external worship, he then refers to the end, <em>They shall bring</em>, he says, <em>confession</em>, or praise, <span class="lang he-il">תודה</span>, <em>tude</em>, into the Temple. <span class="cite-ref">(190)</span> Here by one word Jeremiah includes the chief thing in sacrifices, as we may learn from <span class="bvs">Psa_50:14</span>; where it is said, </p><p>“sacrifice praise unto God.” </p><p>God there rejects the sacrifices which were offered by the Jews without a right motive: he then shews what he required, commanding them to sacrifice praise. So now Jeremiah teaches us that the design of all sacrifices was to celebrate the name of God, that is, that the Jews might profess that they owed all things to him, that they received their life and their safcty freely from him. in short, they were thereby to testify their gratitude before God. So at this day this truth remains the same, though the types have been abolished: we do not offer calves or oxen or rams, but the sacrifice of praise, by confessing and proclaiming his benefits and blessings, according to what the Apostle says in <span class="bvs">Heb_13:15</span>. But what ought to prevail among us apart from types, was formerly accompanied with types; and yet this truth was observed by the Jews in common with us, — that while they offered their sacrifices under the Law, they were to testify their gratitude by visible symbols. Let us proceed — </p><p><strong>(190)</strong> It is more consistent with the rest of the passage to regard this word as meaning “sacrifice of praise,” or thanksgiving, or confession. There were sacrifices of this kind especially prescribed; see <span class="bvs">Lev_7:12</span>, and the word is often taken in this sense, without the word “sacrifice” being connected with it. Offerings according to the Law are the things which are here mentioned: and the same verb “bring,” precedes <span class="lang he-il">תודה</span> as in the previous instances, when “burnt-offering, sacrifice,” etc., are named. </p><p>The <em>Septuagint, </em>as in many other instances, give only a verbal translation, “praise;” “oblation,” is the <em>Vulgate; </em>“thanksgiving,” the <em>Syriac; </em>and “sacrifice of confession,” the <em>Targum. </em></p><p>All the words are singular in Hebrew — burnt-offering — sacrifice — oblation, (or meat-offering) — incense — thanksgiving. It would be well to retain the singular in a version. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
