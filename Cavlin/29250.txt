<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>In whom all the building groweth. </em>If this be true, what will become of Peter? When Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, speaks of Christ as a “Foundation,” he does not mean that the church is begun by him and completed by others, but draws a distinction arising out of a comparison of his own labors with those of other men. It had been his duty to found the church at Corinth, and to leave to his successors the completion of the building. </p><p>“According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth on it.” (<span class="bvs">1Co_3:10</span>.) </p><p>With respect to the present passage, he conveys the instruction, that all who are <em>fitly framed together in Christ </em>are the temple of the Lord. There is first required a fitting together, that believers may embrace and accommodate themselves to each other by mutual intercourse; otherwise there would not be a building, but a confused mass. The chief part of the symmetry consists in unity of faith. Next follows progress, or increase. Those who are not united in faith and love, so as to <em>grow in the Lord, </em>belong to a profane building, which has nothing in common with the temple of the Lord. </p><p><em>Groweth unto an holy temple. </em>Individual believers are at other times called “temples of the Holy Ghost,” (<span class="bvs">1Co_6:19</span>; <span class="bvs">2Co_6:16</span>,) but here all are said to constitute one temple. In both cases the metaphor is just and appropriate. When God dwells in each of us, it is his will that we should embrace all in holy unity, and that thus he should form one temple out of many. Each person, when viewed separately, is a temple, but, when joined to others, becomes a stone of a temple; and this view is given for the sake of recommending the unity of the church. </p></div>
