<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet explains more fully their sin; for their punishment might have appeared extreme, had not their impiety been more clearly unfolded. He then says that this punishment ought not to be regarded as too rigid, because God had not once only protested against the Jews and admonished them in a solemn manner and before witnesses; but they to the last not, only despised his counsel and warnings, but proudly rejected them. And he adds, that they <em>dealt falsely and perfidiously </em>with God, because they pretended that they would be obedient as soon as the will of God was known; but they shewed that in reality they had no such purpose; for their own vanity and deceit took full possession of them when the Prophet answered them in Godâ€™s name; nor had they a desire to obey God. </p><p>Let us now consider the words: <em>Jehovah hath spoken against you, the remnant of Judah </em>He again calls them a <em>remnant, </em>in order that they might remember that they had no reason any more to be proud. We know how the Jews while in prosperity disregarded the Prophets; for they were inebriated with their good fortune. But God had dissipated this pride, with which they were previously filled. The Prophet had also set before them the favor through which they had been liberated, that they might learn hereafter to submit to God and his word. For this reason then he called them a remnant, even to render them more attentive and teachable. But it was done without any benefit; for though their affairs were nearly hopeless, and they were reduced almost to nothing, yet they had not laid aside their high spirits. They were then still swollen with false confidence. But this warning, however, availed to render them more inexcusable. </p><p><em>If ye enter into Egypt, </em>he says, <em>knowing know ye, </em>or, <em>knowing ye shall know. </em>The verb is in the future tense, though it may be taken as an imperative. But the future tense is the most suitable, <em>knowing ye shall know, </em>that is, the event itself will teach you, but too late, as the foolish are never wise till after the evil has taken place. <em>Knowing ye shall know that I have protested against you this day. </em>God says that he had left nothing undone to bring the Jews to a right mind; for a protest is usually made in a solemn manner, witnesses being called in, so that no one can plead that. he has gone astray through ignorance. To take away then every ground of excuse, witnesses were wont to be called. Hence God speaks according to the common practice and in a forensic sense, and says that he had <em>protested </em>against the Jews, lest they should by chance offend through want of knowledge. It then follows, that they knowingly perished, as though they had sought their own destruction. </p></div>
