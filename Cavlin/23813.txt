<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_20:20</span><strong>.</strong><em>Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children. </em>This narrative contains a bright mirror of human vanity; for it shows that proper and holy zeal is often accompanied by ambition, or some other vice of the flesh, so that they who follow Christ have a different object in view from what they ought to have. They who are not satisfied with himself alone, but seek this or the other thing apart from him and his promises, wander egregiously from the right path. Nor is it enough that, at the commencement, we sincerely apply our minds to Christ, if we do not stead-lastly maintain the same purity; for frequently, in the midst of the course, there spring up sinful affections by which we are led astray. In this way it is probable that the <em>two sons of Zebedee </em>were, at first, sincere in their adherence to Christ; but when they see that they have no ordinary share of his favor, and hear his reign spoken of as near at hand, their minds are immediately led to wicked ambition, and they are greatly distressed at the thought of remaining in their present situation. If this happens to two excellent disciples, with what care ought we to walk, if we do not wish to turn aside from the right path! More especially, when any plausible occasion presents itself, we ought to be on our guard, lest the desire of honors corrupt the feeling of piety. </p><p>Though <em>Matthew </em>and <em>Mark </em>differ somewhat in the words, yet they agree as to the substance of the matter. <em>Matthew </em>says that the <em>wife of Zebedee </em>came, and <em>asked for her sons </em>that they might hold the highest places <em>in the kingdom </em>of Christ. Mark represents themselves as making the request. But it is probable that, being restrained by bashfulness, they had the dexterity to employ their mother, who would present the request with greater boldness. That the wish came originally from themselves may be inferred from this circumstance, that Christ replied to them, and not to their mother. Besides, when their mother, <em>bowing down</em>, states that she has something to ask, and when themselves, according to Mark, apply for a general engagement,<em>that whatever they ask shall be granted to them, </em>this timid insinuation proves that they were conscious of something wrong. <span class="cite-ref">(654)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(654)</span><span class="cite-note">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Monstre que leur conscience les redarguoit</span>;” — “shows that their conscience was reproving them.” </p></div></div>
