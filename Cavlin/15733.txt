<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>He turneth rivers into a wilderness </em>Here then is an account of changes which it would be the height of folly to attribute to chance. Fruitful lands become unfruitful, and barren lands assume the new aspect of freshness and fruitfulness. And how happens it that one district becomes sterile, and another becomes fat and fertile, contrary to what they were wont to be, but because that God pours out his wrath upon the inhabitants of the one, by taking his blessing from them, and renders the other fruitful to feed the hungry? It may be ascribed to the thinness of the population, that many parts of Asia and Greece, once exceedingly fruitful, now lie uncultivated and unproductive; but we must ascribe to the providence of God, which the prophet praises, the well authenticated fact, that in some places the earth that was fruitful has now become barren and parched, while others are beginning to be fertile. </p><p>It is, however, not sufficient merely to observe, that these wonderful revolutions of the surface of the earth are the result of God’s overruling purpose, unless we also observe, in the second place, what the prophet does not omit, that the earth is cursed by him on account of the iniquity of its inhabitants, who prove themselves to be undeserving of being so amply sustained by his bountiful hand. He has put <em>pools and springs of water </em>for fields or countries where there is an abundance of water; because moisture is required to nourish the plants by which fruit is produced. The term <em>saltness </em>is employed metaphorically, inasmuch as there is nothing more sterile than salt; hence that saying of Christ’s, </p><p>“If the salt have lost its saltness, what further purpose will it serve?”<LineBreak /><span class="bvs">Mar_9:50</span></p><p>not even indeed for barrenness. And, consequently, when men designed to doom any place to remain unproductive, they usually sowed it with salt. And probably it is in allusion to this ancient custom, that the prophet says that the land was covered with salt. </p></div>
