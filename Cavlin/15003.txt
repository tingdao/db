<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>He shall judge thy people in righteousness. </em>Some read this in the form of a wish — <em>O that he may judge, etc. </em>Others retain the future tense; and thus it is a prophecy. But we will come nearer the correct interpretation by understanding something intermediate, as implied. All that is afterwards spoken, concerning the king, flows from the supposition, that the blessing prayed for in the first verse is conferred upon him — from the supposition that he is adorned with righteousness and judgment. The prayer, then, should be explained thus: Govern our king, O God! that he may judge. Or in this way, When thou shalt have bestowed upon the king thy righteousness, then he will judge uprightly. To govern a nation well, is an endowment far too excellent to grow out of the earth; but the spiritual government of Christ, by which all things are restored to perfect order, ought much more to be considered a gift of heaven. In the first clause of the verse, David speaks of the whole people in general. In the second clause, he expressly mentions <em>the poor, </em>who, on account of their poverty and weakness, have need of the help of others, and for whose sake kings are armed with the sword to grant them redress when unjustly oppressed. Hence, also, proceeds <em>peace, </em>of which mention is made in the third verse. The term <em>peace </em>being employed among the Hebrews to denote not only <em>rest </em>and <em>tranquillity, </em>but also <em>prosperity, </em>David teaches us that the people would enjoy prosperity and happiness, when the affairs of the nation were administered according to the principles of righteousness. <em>The bringing forth of peace </em>is a figurative expression taken from the fertility of the earth. <span class="cite-ref">(125)</span> And when it is said that <em>the mountains and hills shall bring forth peace, </em><span class="cite-ref">(126)</span> the meaning is, that no corner would be found in the country in which it did not prevail, not even the most unpromising parts, indicated by the mountains, which are commonly barren, or at least do not produce so great an abundance of fruits as the valleys. Besides, both the word <em>peace </em>and the word <em>righteousness </em>are connected with each clause of the verse, and must be twice repeated, <span class="cite-ref">(127)</span> the idea intended to be conveyed being, that peace by righteousness <span class="cite-ref">(128)</span> should be diffused through every part of the world. Some read simply <em>righteousness, </em>instead of In <em>righteousness, </em>supposing the letter <span class="lang he-il">ב</span><em>, beth, </em>to be here redundant, which does not, however, appear to be the case. <span class="cite-ref">(129)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(125)</span> As the earth brings forth fruits, so shall the mountains bring forth peace. The same figure is used in <span class="bvs">Psa_85:12</span>, where it is said, “Truth shall spring out of the earth.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(126)</span> Dathe and Boothroyd take another view. According to them, the allusion is to the custom which, in ancient times, prevailed in the East, of announcing good or bad news from the tops of mountains, or other eminences; by means of which, acts of justice were speedily communicated to the remotest part of the country. The same image is used in <span class="bvs">Isa_40:9</span>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(127)</span> That is, we are to read thus: “The mountains shall bring forth peace to the people in righteousness; and the hills shall bring forth peace to the people in righteousness.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(128)</span> “Peace by righteousness.” Calvin considers the Psalmist as representing peace to be the native fruit or effect of righteousness. Such also is the interpretation of Rosenmüller: “‘And <em>the hills </em>shall bring forth peace with <em>justice</em>, or <em>because of justice</em>. ’<em>Justice </em>and <em>peace </em>are joined together, as cause and effect. When iniquity or injustice prevails, general misery is the consequence; and, on the contrary, the prevalence of justice is followed by general felicity. The sense of the clause is, — happiness shall reign throughout the land, for the people shall be governed with equity.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(129)</span> Rosenmüller, in like manner, objects to this reading. “Some expositors,” says he, “consider the prefix <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, <em>beth</em>, as redundant, or as denoting that the noun is in the accusative case; and that the clause may be rendered, <em>And the hills shall bring forth justice </em>Noldius, in his Concordance, adduces several passages as examples of a similar construction; but they appear, all of them, to be constructed on a different principle.” </p></div></div>
