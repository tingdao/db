<div class="comment-content"><p>Here Jonah says first, that men miserably go astray, when they turn aside to vain superstitions, for they rob themselves of the chief good: for he calls whatever help or aid that is necessary for salvation, the mercy of men. The sense then is that as soon as men depart from God, they depart from life and salvation, and that nothing is retained by them, for they willfully cast aside whatever good that can be hoped and desired. Some elicit a contrary meaning, that the superstitious, when they return to a sound mind, relinquish their own reproach; for <span class="lang he-il">חסד</span>, <em>chesad, </em>sometimes means reproach. They then think that the way of true penitence is here described, — that when God restores men from their straying to the right way, he gives them at the same time a sound mind, so that they rid themselves from all their vices. This is indeed true, but it is too strained a meaning. Others confine this to the sailors who vowed sacrifices to God; as though Jonah had said, that they would soon relapse to their own follies, and bid adieu to God, who in his mercy had delivered them from shipwreck; so they explain their mercy to be God; but this is also too forced an explanation. </p><p>I doubt not, therefore, but that Jonah here sets his own religion in opposition to his false intentions of men; for it immediately follows, <em>But I with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee. </em>Jonah, then, having before confessed that he would be thankful to God, now pours contempt on all those inventions which men foolishly contrive for themselves, and through which they withdraw themselves from the only true God, and from the sincere worship of him. For he calls all those devices, by which men deceive themselves<em>, the vanities of falsehood; </em><span class="cite-ref">(40)</span> for it is certain that they are mere fallacies which men invent for themselves without the authority of God’s Word; for truth is one and simple, which God has revealed to us in his world. Whosoever then turns aside the least, either on this or on that side, seeks, as it were designedly, some imposture or another, by which he ruins himself. <em>They </em>then <em>who follow such vanities, says Jonah, forsake their own mercy, </em><span class="cite-ref">(41)</span> that is they reject all happiness: for no aid and no help can be expected from any other quarter than from the only true God. </p><p>But this passage deserves a careful notice; for we hence learn what value to attach to all superstitions, to all those opinions of men, when they attempt to set up religion according to their own will: for Jonah calls them lying or fallacious vanities. There is then but one true religion, the religion which God has taught us in his word. We must also notice, that men in vain weary themselves when they follow their own inventions; for the more strenuously they run, the farther they recede from the right way, as Augustine has well observed. But Jonah here adopts a higher principle, — that God alone possesses in himself all fullness of blessings: whosoever then truly and sincerely seeks God, will find in him whatever can be wished for salvation. But God is not to be sought but by obedience and faith: whosoever then dare to give themselves loose reins, so as to follow this or that without the warrant of God’s word, recede from God, and, at the same time, deprive themselves of all good things. The superstitious do indeed think that they gain much when they toil in their own inventions; but we see what the Holy Spirit declares by the mouth of Jonah. The Lord says the same by Jeremiah </p><p>“They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and cisterns have they digged for themselves,” (<span class="bvs">Jer_2:13</span>.) </p><p>There the Lord complains of his chosen people, who had gone astray after wicked superstitions. Hence, when men wander beyond the word of God, they in a manner renounce God, or say adieu to him; and thus they deprive themselves of all good things; for without God there is no salvation and no help to be found. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(40)</span><span class="lang he-il">הבלי-שוא</span>, “Idols of vanity or falsehood,” <em>i.e., </em>false, or deceitful, or vain idols. <span class="lang he-il">הבל</span> means vapor, smoke, breath, vanity, inanity: but in the plural number it is applied for the most part to idols. See <span class="bvs">Deu_32:21</span>; <span class="bvs">1Kg_16:13</span><span class="lang he-il">שוא</span> is a lie, which is vain — useless, and false — deceptive. <em>Marckius </em>renders the words, “Vanitates inanitatis — vanities of inanity’” <em>Junius </em>and <em>Tremelius, </em>“Vanitates mendaces — mendacious vanities;” <em>Septuagint, </em>“<span class="lang el-gr">ματαια και Ψευδη</span> — vain and false things.” “He thus calls idols,” says an author in Poole’s Syn., “and all those things in which any one, excluding God, trusts; which are nothing, and can do nothing, and which deceive their worshippers.” This is true, that is, that all other things, as well as idols, are, apart from God, vain, and worthless, and deceptive; but the reference here no doubt is to idols. They are not only empty, but deceptive. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(41)</span><span class="lang he-il">חסדם יעזבו</span>, “Their mercy or goodness they forsake,” that is, the mercy exhibited and offered to them by God; or, if we render it goodness, it means their chief good, which is God. The Psalmist calls God his goodness in <span class="bvs">Psa_144:2</span>, <span class="lang he-il">חסדי</span>, “my goodness,” the giver of all his goodness, or his chief good. <em>Dathius </em>gives very correctly the meaning of the two lines in these words — </p><p><em>“ </em><em>Qui vana idola colunt, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Felicitatis suae auctorem deserunt </em> —<em><LineBreak /></em><em>They who worship vain idols, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Desert the author of their own happiness.” </em></p><p>More literally — </p><p>“They who attend on the idols of vanity, <LineBreak />Their own goodness forsake.” </p><p>There is a contrast between vain idols and their own goodness, that is, the goodness received by them from God. <em>Grotius </em>gives this paraphrase, “They who worship idols are vain; for they forsake their own mercy, that is, God, who is able to help them in their distress.” <em>Henry </em>suggests another view, “They who follow their own inventions, as Jonah had done, when he fled from the presence of the lord to go to Tarshish, forsake their own mercy, that mercy which they may find in God.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
