<div class="comment-content"><p>God now again confirms the truth, that he would not in one way only be bountiful to them. He might indeed distribute to us daily our food, as we know that he thus fed his people in the wilderness; but his will is that the seed should rot in the earth, that it should then germinate, and in course of time grow, until it shoots into ears of corn; but it is still in no small danger, nay the corn is subject to many evils before it be gathered into the garner; for the locusts, the worms, the mildew, and other things may destroy it. God therefore, in order to set forth his kindness to men, enumerates here the ways and the means by which food is preserved; for it would not be enough that the seed should germinate, and that there should appear evidences of a great produce, the ears being fine and abundant, but it is necessary that the ears of corn themselves, before they become ripe, should be preserved from above; for on the one hand the chafers, the locusts, the worms, and other grubs, may suddenly creep in and devour the corn while in the field, and on the other hand, storms, and hail, and mildew, and oilier pestilential things, as I have said, may prove ruinous to the corn. </p><p>Hence God shows here, that he takes constant care of us, and every day and every night performs the office of a good and careful head of a family, who always watches for its benefit. </p><p>In the word <em>devourer</em>, I include all the evils to which we see that corn is subject; he therefore says, <em>he shall not destroy the fruit of the earth; nor bereaved shall be the vine for you in the fields</em>. The verb <span class="lang he-il">שכל</span>, <em>shecal</em>, properly means to bereave or to deprive; but as this version, “bereaved shall not be vine,” would be harsh, some have rendered the words thus, “Miscarry shall not vine,” which I do not disapprove: <em>Miscarry </em>then <em>shall not the vine for you in the fields, saith Jehovah of hosts </em><span class="cite-ref">(259)</span> It follows — </p><p><strong>(259)</strong> There is no necessity for giving to <span class="lang he-il">שכל</span> here any other than its ordinary meaning of bereaving or depriving. The reference is to depredators who bereaved or stripped the vine of its fruit—an evil common in a confused and disordered state of things. </p><p>The word <span class="lang he-il">לכם</span>, “on your account,” is repeated in this verse three times; and it has no doubt an emphatic meaning. What is intimate evidently is, that the evils promised here to be removed were on their account, <em>i.e., </em>for their sins. I render the verse thus, — </p><p>And I will restrain on your account the devourer, And he shall not destroy on your account the fruit of the ground, And bereaved on your account shall not be the vine in the field, Saith the Lord of hosts </p><p>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
