<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Therefore, brethren, look out. </em>Now we see to what end deacons were made. The word itself is indeed general, yet is it properly taken for those which are stewards for the poor. Whereby it appeareth how licentiously the Papists do mock God and men, who assign unto their deacons no other office but this, to have the charge of <span class="cite-ref">(331)</span> the paten and chalice. Surely we need no disputation to prove that they agree in no point with the apostles. But if the readers be desirous to see any more concerning this point, they may repair unto our Institution, chapter 8. As touching this present place, the Church is permitted to choose. For it is tyrannous if any one man appoint or make ministers at his pleasure. <span class="cite-ref">(332)</span> Therefore, this is the (most) lawful way, that those be chosen by common voices <span class="cite-ref">(333)</span> who are to take upon them <span class="cite-ref">(334)</span> any public function in the Church. And the apostles prescribe what manner [of] persons ought to be chosen, to wit, men of tried honesty and credit, <span class="cite-ref">(335)</span> men endued with wisdom <span class="cite-ref">(336)</span> and other gifts of the Spirit. And this is the mean between tyranny and confused liberty, <span class="cite-ref">(337)</span> that nothing be done without <span class="cite-ref">(338)</span> the consent and approbation of the people, yet so that the pastors moderate and govern (this action, <span class="cite-ref">(339)</span>) that their authority may be as a bridle to keep under the people, <span class="cite-ref">(340)</span> lest they pass their bounds too much. In the mean season, this is worth the noting, that the apostles prescribe an order unto the faithful, lest they appoint any save those which are fit. For we do God no small injury if we take all that come to hand <span class="cite-ref">(341)</span> to govern his house. Therefore, we must use great circumspection that we choose none <span class="cite-ref">(342)</span> unto the holy function of the Church unless we have some trial of him first. The number of seven is applied <span class="cite-ref">(343)</span> unto the present necessity, lest any man should think <span class="cite-ref">(344)</span> that there is some mystery comprehended under the same. Whereas Luke saith, <em>full of the Spirit and wisdom, </em>I do interpret it thus, that it is requisite that they be furnished both with other gifts of the Spirit, and also with wisdom, <span class="cite-ref">(345)</span> without which that function cannot be exercised well, both that they may beware of the leger-demain <span class="cite-ref">(346)</span> of those men, who being too much given unto begging, require <span class="cite-ref">(347)</span> that which is necessary for the poverty of the brethren, and also of their slanders, who cease not to backbite, though they have none occasion given them. For that function is not only painful, but also subject to many ungodly murmurings. <span class="cite-ref">(348)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(331)</span> “Tractent,” to handle. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(332)</span> “Constituat suo arbitrio,” constitute at his own pleasure. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(333)</span> “Elegi communibus suffragiis,” be elected by the common suffrages. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(334)</span> “Obidentia,” are to perform. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(335)</span> “Probate fidei,” of tried faith. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(336)</span> “Prudentia,” wisdom or prudence. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(337)</span> “Licentiam,” licentious freedom. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(338)</span> “Nisi ex,” except by. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(339)</span> “Pastores tamen moderentur,” let pastors, however, moderate. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(340)</span> “Ad cohibendos plebis impetus,” to curb the impetus (precipitancy or violence) of the people. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(341)</span> “Si fortuito quoslibet accipimus, “if we receive all persons whatsoever fortuitously. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(342)</span> “Summa religio ne quis sumatur,” the greatest care that none be chosen. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(343)</span> “Accommodatus fuit,” was accommodated. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(344)</span> “Ne quis putet,” let no man suppose. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(345)</span> “Prudentia.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(346)</span> “Imposturis et fraudibus,” the imposition and fraud. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(347)</span> “Exsugunt,” suck up. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(348)</span> “Non laboriosa modo, sed obnoxia sinistris murmuribus,” is not only laborious, but liable to sinister murmurings. </p></div></div>
