<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Who hath delivered us. </em>Mark, here is the beginning of our salvation — when God delivers us from the depth of ruin into which we were plunged. For wherever his grace is not, <em>there </em>is darkness, <span class="cite-ref">(297)</span> as it is said in <span class="bvs">Isa_60:2</span></p><p>Behold darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the nations; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. </p><p>In the first place, we ourselves are called darkness, and afterwards the whole world, and Satan, the Prince of darkness, <span class="cite-ref">(298)</span> under whose tyranny we are held captive, until we are set free by Christ’s hand. <span class="cite-ref">(299)</span> From this you may gather that the whole world, with all its pretended wisdom and righteousness, is regarded as nothing but darkness in the sight of God, because, apart from the kingdom of Christ, there is no light. </p><p><em>Hath translated us into the kingdom. </em>These form already the beginnings of our blessedness — when we are <em>translated into the kingdom </em>of Christ, because we <em>pass from death into life</em>. (<span class="bvs">1Jo_3:14</span>.) This, also, Paul ascribes to the grace of God, that no one may imagine that he can attain so great a blessing by his own efforts. As, then, our deliverance from the slavery of sin and death is the work of God, so also our passing into the kingdom of Christ. He calls Christ the Son of his love, or the Son that is beloved by God the Father, because it is in him alone that his soul takes pleasure, as we read in <span class="bvs">Mat_17:5</span>, and in whom all others are beloved. For we must hold it as a settled point, that we are not acceptable to God otherwise than through Christ. Nor can it be doubted, that Paul had it in view to censure indirectly the mortal enmity that exists between men and God, until love shines forth in the Mediator. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(297)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Là il n’y a que tenebres</span>;” — “There is nothing but darkness.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(298)</span> “One of the names which the Jews gave to Satan was <span class="lang he-il">חש</span> — darkness” — Illustrated Commentary. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(299)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Iusqu’a ce que nons soyons deliurez et affranchis par la puissance de Christ</span>;” — “Until we are delivered and set free by the power of Christ.” </p></div></div>
