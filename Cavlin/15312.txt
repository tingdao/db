<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>For my soul is filled with troubles. </em>These words contain the excuse which the prophet pleads for the excess of his grief. They imply that his continued crying did not proceed from softness or effeminacy of spirit, but that from a due consideration of his condition, it would be found that the immense accumulation of miseries with which he was oppressed was such as might justly extort from him these lamentations. Nor does he speak of one kind of calamity only; but of calamities so heaped one upon another that his heart was filled with sorrow, till it could contain no more. He next particularly affirms that his life was not far from the grave. This idea he pursues and expresses in terms more significant in the following verse, where he complains that he <em>was, </em>as it were, dead. Although he breathed still among the living, yet the many deaths with which he was threatened on all sides were to him so many graves by which he expected to be swallowed up in a moment. And he seems to use the word <span class="lang he-il">גבר</span><em>, geber, </em>which is derived from <span class="lang he-il">גבר</span><em>, gabar, he prevailed, </em>or <em>was strong, </em><span class="cite-ref">(509)</span> in preference to the word which simply signifies <em>man, </em>— the more emphatically to show that his distresses were so great and crushing as to have been sufficient to bring down the strongest man. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(509)</span> See volume 2, page 320, note 2. Some consider the words <span class="lang he-il">מחלת לענות</span>, <em>Machalath Leannoth</em>, which Calvin renders “Machalath, to make humble,” as together denoting an instrument of music. “For my part,” says Dr Morison, “I lean to the idea that these words are intended to denote some musical instrument of the plaintive order; and in this opinion Kimchi and other Jewish writers perfectly agree. They assert that it was a wind-instrument, answering very much to the flute, and employed mainly in giving utterance to sentiments of grief, upon occasions of great sorrow and lamentation.” </p></div></div>
