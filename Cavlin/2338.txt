<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them. </em>Since I shall again repeat and more fully explain these things as they are written in <span class="bvs">Lev_9:0</span>, in the history of the consecration of the tabernacle, it will be sufficient to give nothing more than a brief summary of them here; nor is it my custom to invent mysteries out of vague speculations, <span class="cite-ref">(174)</span> such as may rather gratify than instruct my readers. First, since the whole human race is corrupt and infected with many impurities, so that his uncleanness prevents every single individual from having access to God, Moses, before he consecrates the priests, washes them by the sprinkling of water, in order that they may be no longer deemed to be of ordinary rank. Hence we gather that true purity and innocence, which was but typical in the Law, is found in Christ alone. “For such an high priest became us,” says the Apostle, “who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,” to present Himself before God for us. (<span class="bvs">Heb_7:26</span>.) After they had been washed, God commands that they should be invested with the sacerdotal dress, according to their respective ranks: that the high priest should wear the ephod with the <em>Urim </em>and <em>Thummim, </em>and the mitre with the golden plate, on which shone forth “holiness to Jehovah;” and in the third place, He adds the anointing. This preparation was for the purpose of initiating them, before they performed the office of sacrificing; but it must be observed that, as to this first sacrifice, the duties which were afterwards transferred to Aaron were imposed upon Moses, as if he were the only priest; and, in point of fact, the temporal dignity which he afterwards resigned to his brother, was still in his own hands. What Moses introduces about the division of the victim, we shall more conveniently explain elsewhere, in treating of the offerings, which we have stated to be the third part of the legal worship. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(174)</span> Probably the <em>Fr., “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">de speculations volantes</span>,” suggests the right reading of the <em>Lat. </em>here, viz., <em>alatis </em> for <em>aliis </em></p></div></div>
