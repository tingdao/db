<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>For I could wish, etc. </em>He could not have expressed a greater ardour of love than by what he testifies here; for that is surely perfect love which refuses not to die for the salvation of a friend. But there is another word added, <em>anathema </em><em>, </em>which proves that he speaks not only of temporal but of eternal death; and he explains its meaning when he says, <em>from Christ, </em>for it signifies a separation. And what is to be separated from Christ, but to be excluded from the hope of salvation? It was then a proof of the most ardent love, that Paul hesitated not to wish for himself that condemnation which he saw impending over the Jews, in order that he might deliver them. It is no objection that he knew that his salvation was based on the election of God, which could by no means fail; for as those ardent feelings hurry us on impetuously, so they see and regard nothing but the object in view. So Paul did not connect God’s election with his wish, but the remembrance of that being passed by, he was wholly intent on the salvation of the Jews. </p><p>Many indeed doubt whether this was a lawful desire; but this doubt may be thus removed: the settled boundary of love is, that it proceeds as far as conscience permits; <span class="cite-ref">(285)</span> if then we love in God and not without God’s authority, our love can never be too much. And such was the love of Paul; for seeing his own nation endued with so many of God’s benefits, he loved God’s gifts in them, and them on account of God’s gifts; and he deemed it a great evil that those gifts should perish, hence it was that his mind being overwhelmed, he burst forth into this extreme wish. <span class="cite-ref">(286)</span></p><p>Thus I consent not to the opinion of those who think that Paul spoke these words from regard to God only, and not to men; nor do I agree with others, who say, that without any thought of God, he was influenced only by love to men: but I connect the love of men with a zeal for God’s glory. </p><p>I have not, however, as yet explained that which is the chief thing, — that the Jews are here regarded as they were adorned with those singular tokens, by which they were distinguished from the rest of mankind. For God had by his covenant so highly exalted them, that by their fall, the faithfulness and truth of God himself seemed also to fail in the world: for that covenant would have thus become void, the stability of which was promised to be perpetual, as long as the sun and moon should shine in heaven. (<span class="bvs">Psa_72:7</span>.) So that the abolition of this would have been more strange, than the sad and ruinous confusion of the whole world. It was not therefore a simple and exclusive regard for men: for though it is better that one member should perish than the whole body; it was yet for this reason that Paul had such a high regard for the Jews, because he viewed them as bearing the character, and, as they commonly say, the quality of an elect people; and this will appear more evident, as we shall soon see, from what follows. </p><p>The words, <em>my kinsmen according to the flesh, </em>though they contain nothing new, do yet serve much for amplification. For first, lest any one should think that he willingly, or of his own accord, sought cause of quarrel with the <em>Jews, </em>he intimates, that he had not put off the feeling of kindred, so as not to be affected with the destruction of his own flesh. And secondly, since it was necessary that the gospel, of which he was the preacher, should go forth from Sion, he does not in vain pronounce an eulogy in so many words on his own kindred. For the qualifying expression, <em>according to the flesh, </em>is not in my view added for the sake of extenuation, as in other places, but, on the contrary, for the sake of expressing his faith: for though the Jews had disowned Paul, he yet concealed not the fact, that he had sprung from that nation, the election of whom was still strong in the root, though the branches had withered. What <em>Budoeus </em>says of the word <em>anathema </em><em>, </em>is inconsistent with the opinion of [<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>] <em>, </em>who makes <span class="lang el-gr">ἀνάθεμα</span> and <span class="lang el-gr">ἀνάθημα</span><em>, </em>to be the same. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(285)</span> “Ut ad aras usque procedat.” [<span class="bvs">Ainsworth </span>] gives a similar phrase and explains its reason, “Usque ad aras amicus — As far as conscience permits,” Gell.<em>, </em>because in swearing they held the horns of the altar. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(286)</span> Most of those who take this view of the passage express the implied condition more distinctly than is done here. They have regarded the wish in this sense, “I could wish were it right or lawful.” So thought [<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Photius </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Theophlylact </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Luther </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Parcus </span>], [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Estius </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Lightfoot </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Witsius </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Mode </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Whitby </span>] <em>, </em>and others. The words of [<span class="bvs">Photius </span>] are given by [<span class="bvs">Wolfius </span>] <em>, “He </em>says not, I wish to be separated, but I could wish, that is, were it possible<span class="lang el-gr">— ἠυχόμην ἂν τουτ ἐστιν εἰ δυνατὸν ἦν,</span><em>” </em>[<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Hodge </span>] adopt the same view. “It was a conditional wish,” says [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] <em>, </em>“like that of Christ in <span class="bvs">Mat_26:39</span>. Christ knew and Paul knew that it could not be granted, and yet both expressed their strong desire.” See <span class="bvs">Exo_32:32</span></p><p>Almost all critics agree that the Vulgate is wrong in rendering the verb <em>optabam </em> — “I did wish,” as though the Apostle referred to the time, as [<span class="bvs">Ambrose </span>] supposed, when he was a Pharisee; but this is wholly inconsistent with the tenor of the passage. [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] <em>, </em>and most others regard the verb as having an optative meaning<span class="lang el-gr">; ἂν </span> being understood after it, as the case is with<span class="lang el-gr">ἐβουλόμην </span> in <span class="bvs">Act_25:22</span>, and<span class="lang el-gr">ἤθελον </span> in <span class="bvs">Gal_4:20</span></p><p>There are two other opinions which deserve notice. The first is, that “anathema “ here means excommunication, and that “from Christ” signifies from his Church, Christ the head being taken for his body the Church, as in <span class="bvs">1Co_12:12</span>, and in <span class="bvs">Gal_3:27</span>, according to the manner of the Hebrews, as [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] says, who called the wife by the name of the husband, <span class="bvs">Isa_4:1</span>. This is the view taken by [<span class="bvs">Hammond </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] <em>, </em>and some of the Lutheran divines. But the word “anathema “ has not in Scripture this meaning, though in after-ages it had attained it both in the Church and among the Rabbins. In the New Testament it occurs only here and in <span class="bvs">Act_23:14</span>; <span class="bvs">1Co_12:3</span>; and <span class="bvs">Gal_1:8</span>; and the verb<span class="lang el-gr">ἀναθεματίζω </span> is found in <span class="bvs">Mar_14:71</span>; <span class="bvs">Act_23:12</span>; and with<span class="lang el-gr">κατὰ </span> prefixed in <span class="bvs">Mat_26:74</span>. The corresponding word in Hebrew, <span class="lang he-il">הרם</span>, rendered <em>“ </em><em>anathema </em><em>“ </em>by the <em>Septuagint, </em>means two things: what is separated for a holy purpose and wholly devoted to God, incapable of being redeemed, <span class="bvs">Lev_27:28</span>; and what is set apart and devoted to death or destruction, <span class="bvs">Jos_6:17</span>; <span class="bvs">Ezr_10:8</span>. It never means excommunication, but cutting off by death. Compare <span class="bvs">Exo_22:20</span>, and <span class="bvs">Deu_13:1</span>. It has hence been applied to designate a man that is execrable and accursed, deserving death. So the Apostle uses it in <span class="bvs">1Co_16:22</span>, and <span class="bvs">Gal_1:8</span></p><p>The other view is more in accordance with the meaning of the term. It is thought that “anathema “ means an ignominious death, and that of one apparently separated from Christ; or that he wished to be made “an anathema” by Christ, or for the sake of Christ, or after Christ, that is, his example. The words<span class="lang el-gr">ἀπὸ τοῦ Χριστοῦ </span> create all the difficulty in this case. This is the explanation given by [<span class="bvs">Jerome </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Locke </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Limborch </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] <em>, </em>and [<span class="bvs">Scott </span>] The first meaning, however, as materially given by [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] <em>, </em>is the most obvious and natural. </p><p>Both [<span class="bvs">Haldane </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Chalmers </span>] follow the Vulgate, and put the clause in a parenthesis, as expressing the Apostle’s wish when unconverted; but there is altogether an incongruity in the terms he employs to express this wish; he surely would not have said that he wished to be separated from Christ as an accursed thing, for that is the meaning of anathema; for while he was a Pharisee he deemed it a privilege and an honour even to persecute Christ. And we cannot suppose that the Apostle would now describe his former wish in terms unsuitable to what it really was, but as he now regarded it. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
