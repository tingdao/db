<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong>Stephen addeth the means, because God gave him favor in the sight of Pharaoh. God could have delivered him by some other means, but his counsel had respect unto a farther thing, that Joseph, being ruler of the kingdom, might entertain his father and all his family. In these two words, <em>favor </em>and <em>wisdom, </em>there is the figure <em>hypalloge. </em>For the wisdom wherewith Joseph was endued was the cause that he found favor; although I confess that they were two distinct benefits. For, though Joseph were a faithful interpreter of dreams, and did excel in divine wisdom, yet the proud tyrant would never have brought him to so great honor, unless God had bent the mind of Pharaoh unto a certain unwonted love; yet, notwithstanding, we must consider that order whereby God useth to bring him into favor. <span class="cite-ref">(392)</span><em>Wisdom </em>doth not only signify the gift of prophecy in interpreting dreams, but prudence in giving counsel; for Moses putteth in both. That which Stephen reporteth of one man in this place is extended unto all. For what aptness and readiness <span class="cite-ref">(393)</span> soever is in men, it ought to be reckoned amongst the gifts of God, and that his special gifts. <span class="cite-ref">(394)</span> And it is he that giveth good success as it pleaseth him, that his gifts may be profitable to that end for which it seemed good to him to give them. Therefore, although Joseph be made chief ruler of Egypt by Pharaoh, yet is he lifted up to so great honor properly by the hand of God. <span class="cite-ref">(395)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(392)</span> “Illi Deus gratiam conciliat,” procureth favor for him. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(393)</span> “Dexteritas,” dexterity. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(394)</span> “Pro modo inaequali,” according to the unequal mode of distribution, omitted. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(395)</span> “Non nisi Dei manu,” by nought but the hand of God. </p></div></div>
