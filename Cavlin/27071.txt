<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong>He returneth to miracles of another sort, which are more proper to the gospel; to wit, whereby Christ doth not only declare his power, but also his goodness; to the end he may allure men unto himself with the sweetness of his grace. For he came to save the world, and not to condemn it. Therefore, whereas the sick are healed, and others are delivered from devils, these benefits done to the body do represent the spiritual grace of Christ; and therefore they agree with his natural <span class="cite-ref">(249)</span> office that I may so speak. That fearful sign which was showed in Ananias and Sapphira came to pass extraordinarily <span class="cite-ref">(250)</span> Luke saith that the Church was increased by miracles, because they serve for faith, <span class="cite-ref">(251)</span> (as we have said,) to prepare some, to confirm others. Whereby that is proved again, which I have said elsewhere that miracles must never be separated from the word. Luke showeth the multitude of miracles by this, in that the sick were brought forth everywhere, that they might be healed. For God meant thus to set forth the gospel of his Son, especially at the beginning; that he, might for a certainty testify to the Jews, that that restoring of all things was present, which was so often promised, and in which all their hope was reposed, as they themselves did pretend, (and make semblance.) It is well known that couches were certain little beds in which the men of old were wont to rest at noon. Because they might the more easily carry them out, they laid the sick in them. </p><p><em>And they were all with one accord. </em>He signifieth unto us that they were wont to meet together at certain hours, not only for doctrine and prayers’ sake, but that they might win others unto the Lord, as occasion was given. For every man lived at home at his own house, but they had their meetings there, as assuredly no body of the Church can otherwise continue. For if every man will be his own teacher, and pray apart by himself, and if there be no meetings and assemblies, how excellently soever the Church be ordered and appointed, yet must it needs decay and come to nought. He saith that they were all of one mind, to the end we may know that they did all keep that order willingly, that no man was so disordered as to keep himself at home, <span class="cite-ref">(252)</span> neglecting the public assembly. Wherein they showed a token, not only of modesty, but also of constancy. For they could not do this without danger, seeing the place was so famous. For which cause, the agreement of them all to put themselves in hazard was so much the more worthy of commendation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(249)</span> “Genuino,” genuine. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(250)</span> “Quasi accidentale erat,” was, as it were, accidental. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(251)</span> “Fidei subserviunt,” are subservient to faith. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(252)</span> “Intra privates parietes se teneret,” as to keep himself within a private buildings. </p></div></div>
