<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Woman, thou art delivered </em>In this miracle, as well as in others, Christ exhibited a proof both of his power and of his grace; for in this manner he testified that he had come for the purpose of granting relief to the wretched. His power is expressed in these words, <em>Woman, thou art delivered; </em>for he authoritatively declares that deliverance was at his own disposal, and employs, at the same time, the outward sign, the use of which we have explained on a former occasion. </p></div>
