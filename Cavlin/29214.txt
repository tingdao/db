<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>In all wisdom. </em>He now comes to the formal cause, the preaching of the gospel, by which the goodness of God <em>overflows upon us. </em><span class="cite-ref">(113)</span> It is through faith that we receive Christ, by whom we come to God, and by whom we enjoy the privilege of adoption. Paul gives to the gospel the magnificent appellations of <em>wisdom and prudence, </em>for the purpose of leading the Ephesians to despise all contrary doctrines. The false apostles insinuated themselves, under the pretense of imparting views more elevated than the elementary instructions which Paul conveyed. And the devil, in order to undermine our faith, labors, as far as he can, to disparage the gospel. Paul, on the other hand, builds up the authority of the gospel, that believers may rest upon it with unshaken confidence. <em>All wisdom </em>means — full or perfect wisdom. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(113)</span><span class="lang el-gr">ἧς ἐπερίσσευσεν</span> — “<span class="lang el-gr">ἧς</span> for <span class="lang el-gr">ἧ</span>, (by a common Grecism, in which the relative is attracted by the antecedent,) if, at least, we take <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπερίσσευσεν</span>, with many modern expositors, in a <em>neuter </em>sense, ‘in which he hath renewed his abundant goodness to us;’ but if, with the ancient and some modern ones, in an active sense, ‘to make to abound,’ (as in <span class="bvs">2Co_4:15</span>,) the <span class="lang el-gr">ἧς</span> will be for <span class="lang el-gr">ἥν</span>, meaning, ‘which he has bountifully bestowed upon us.'“ — Bloomfield. </p></div></div>
