<div class="comment-content"><p>He then adds, <em>And the whole valley </em>Some read, “the whole valley shall be holiness to Jehovah:” and it may be suitably taken, that all the places near to the city were to be holy to God; but this verse may be connected with the preceding, as though he said, extended shall be the line to the <em>whole valley of the carcases and of the ashes </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">דשן</span><em>, dashin, </em>means ashes and fatness; but here it is to be taken for ashes; and it is thought that the place was so called, where they were wont to throw the ashes gathered from the altar, after the sacrifices were burnt: as then there was there a great heap of ashes, the place had this name given to it. Another place was also called the place of carcases, because there a host of enemies had been slain by an angel, in the reign of Hezekiah. As then a great and a memorable slaughter had taken place there, it is thought that it received this name, in order that God’s favor might remain known to posterity. If then this name became the monument of God’s favor, Hezekiah, I have no doubt, was the cause of it. </p><p>It is then added, <em>and all the regions to the brook Kidron </em>It is probable enough that the places here named were outside of the city, for we know that the brook Kidron was not within the city. Then he adds, <em>to the corner of the gate of the horses </em>It is thought that through this gate went forth the chariots of the king when he wished to exercise his horses. It might have been the market-place for horses. Conjectures only have place here; for no one knows of a certainty whether the king had a place of exercise for his horses. But this gate looked towards the east. He says that all the places would be <em>holiness to Jehovah; </em>and then he promises them a quiet and a perpetual condition, <em>It shall not be cut off nor destroyed any more for ever; </em>for which it is said by Zechariah, “there shall be no more <span class="lang he-il">חרם</span><em>cherim, </em>destruction.” <span class="cite-ref">(57)</span></p><p>We now see the design of the Prophet: after having spoken of the return of the people, he adds that the city would again become splendid and large, as it had been; for the land continued in a state of disorder until the restoration of the city, as God had there chosen a habitation for himself. And as the Temple had been built there, it behoved the Israelites, wherever they dwelt, ever to direct their eyes to the Temple and the sanctuary of God, that they might live under his protection. Except, then, the city had been built again, the goodness of God could not have been really enjoyed; for a sort of desolation would have otherwise ever presented itself to the eyes of the people, as the city was as it were the banner under which God protected them. This then is the reason why the Prophet expressly announced this prophecy respecting the future restoration of the city. </p><p>Now, when he says that the <em>city would be built to Jehovah, </em>he intimates what was especially expected by the Jews, that that city would again be holy; for if it only flourished in wealth and power like other cities, it would have been but a small comfort to the Israelites. But he points out here a difference between Jerusalem and all heathen cities; for God was, as it were, the architect of that city, as it is said in the Psalms, </p><p>“He himself founded it,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_87:5</span>) </p><p>and further, </p><p>“His foundations are on the holy mountains,” </p><p>and this ought to be understood of himself. (<span class="bvs">Psa_87:1</span>) The meaning is, that God would again care for that city, as the Temple would become as it were his royal throne and earthly sanctuary. At the same time when the Prophet affirms that the extent of the city would not be less than it had been, we see that this prophecy must necessarily be referred to the kingdom of Christ: for though Jerusalem before Christ’s coming was eminent and surrounded by a triple wall, and though it was celebrated through all the East, as even heathen writers say that it excelled every other city, yet it was never accomplished, that the city flourished as under David and Solomon. <span class="cite-ref">(58)</span> We must then necessarily come to the spiritual state of the city, and explain the promise as the grace which came through Christ. </p><p>But we must especially notice what is said, that it would be <em>holiness to Jehovah, </em>and also that no ruin or destruction would be dreaded any more. Had the condition of the elect people been the same as that of other nations, the promise of restoration would have been small and of no great moment; for it would have been better for them to dwell in exile where they inhabited a pleasant and fertile country. But the Prophet here commends a privilege with which God had favored the children of Abraham above all other nations, when he adopted them as his peculiar people. There is however to be understood an implied contrast between the profanation which then prevailed, and the sanctification which is here promised. The Jews had so polluted the land that it differed nothing from other countries; and God, as Ezekiel says, had thence migrated, (<span class="bvs">Eze_8:6</span>) and we know that the Temple was called by the prophets the den of robbers, (<span class="bvs">Jer_7:11</span>) and that the city was also compared to Sodom and Gomorrah. (<span class="bvs">Isa_1:10</span>) Hence the Prophet here promises that the city, with its whole vicinity, would be holy to God, because God would cleanse it from all the defilements by which it had been polluted: and he also claims this as his own work, for to sanctify is a work peculiar to himself. </p><p>The promise of perpetual favor is added, as it is also done by Zechariah; for it would not be sufficient to have God’s mercy promised to us for a short time, except its perpetuity were secured. The Prophet then promises now that the course of God’s benefits would be permanent;. The city indeed was again destroyed by Titus, and at length wholly demolished by Adrian; but this fact does not militate against this promise; for as we have said, God gave some taste of his favor in the external aspect of the city until Christ came; but after Christ was manifested, the heavenly Jerusalem became the object to be sought, for all the types and shadows then ceased. The perpetuity then of which the Prophet speaks, is that which corresponds with the character of Christ’s kingdom, and is therefore spiritual. Moreover, this passage teaches us that the Church will be perpetual, and that though God may permit it to be terribly shaken and tossed here and there, there will yet be ever some seed remaining, as long as the sun and the moon shall shine in the heavens, and the order of nature shall continue; so that all the elements, everything we see with our eyes, bear evidence to the perpetuity of the Church, even that it will ever continue: for though Satan and all the world daily threaten its ruin, yet the Lord will in a wonderful manner preserve it to the end, so that it will never perish. This is the import of the passage. Another prophecy follows. </p><p><strong>(57)</strong> The whole of this passage is differently rendered in the early versions and the <em>Targum; </em>some of them evidently wrong and some doubtful. <em>Blayney </em>gives the most literal and most consistent version. I give the following, — </p><p><strong>38.</strong>Behold the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That built shall the city be for (or to) Jehovah, From the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner: </p><p><strong>39.</strong>Yea, go forth again shall the measuring line From over against it, over the hill of Oareb, And shall surround Goath </p><p><strong>40.</strong>And all the valley of the carcases and ashes, And all the fields to the river Kidron, To the corner of the gate of the horses eastward: Holy to Jehovah, it shall not be rooted up, Nor demolished any more for ever. </p><p>The 38<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse (<span class="bvs">Jer_31:38</span>) contains a general description; this is particularized in the following verses. The beginning of measuring was to be at “the tower of Hananeel;” hence “from over against it,” or before it: the “gate” being feminine cannot be meant; it is then “the tower.” As to the word for “fields,” the reading of the <em>Keri </em>and of several MSS., countenanced by the <em>Vulg., </em>ought no doubt to be adopted. “Eastward,” — thus the line came round to the same point where it began; for the tower of Hananeel was eastward. But what is referred to in the two last lines? The verbs are in the masculine gender, and “city” is feminine; and there is nothing in the passage with which they can agree except the tower of Hananeel. Then this tower seems to stand here for the rebuilt city; and then rooting up, <em>i.e., </em>undermining the foundations, and demolishing, are suitably applied to a tower. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(58)</strong> Some think, such as <em>Gataker </em>and <em>Blayney, </em>that according to the description here given, the dimensions of the city are much larger than what they had ever been before. The “line” was to inclose a part at least of the hill of Gareb, the whole of Goath, supposed to be Golgotha, the valley of the carcases, and the fields of Kidron, all which were formerly without the walls of the city. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
