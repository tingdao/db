<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>For we found this man. </em>Tertullus doth aim at a double mark. The first is this, that Paul may be delivered to the Jews, because they be very skillful in matters which concern the worship of God and the law of Moses. But and if he deny this, he layeth to his charge a crime worthy of death, because he procured contention<span class="cite-ref">(566)</span> among the people. They knew that the Romans did hate nothing more, therefore they urge that the sorest against Paul. This doth Tertullus amplify when he saith, that Paul had moved the Jews throughout the whole world. But I wonder why he addeth that he is the author or chief of the sect of the Nazarites, which we know was rather a praise than a dispraise among the Jews. I think that they mean not those who, according to the old and lawful custom of the law, did consecrate themselves to God, but those troublesome murderers who did also vaunt and boast that they were zealous men.<span class="cite-ref">(567)</span> Some<span class="cite-ref">(568)</span> think that Nazarites are here put for Christians, which may very well be. But if we like the former exposition better, he doth craftily lay to Paul’s charge that he was one of that sect which the Romans did hate. For whereas these zealous men would above all other have been counted for notable observers of the law, they advanced a color of zeal as a banner to stir up the minds of the common people. Nevertheless, these good men, who are so zealous over their liberty, do not spare the chiefest maintainers thereof, so they may cause Paul to be hated by means of them. They would have commended the Nazarites as courageous defenders of the law, if it had not been in this matter, but now, as if they did infect the whole world, they seek to bring upon Paul great reproach by saying that he is one of them. Moreover, they slander Paul impudently, for no man did think that he was guilty of that crime. Therefore they lay to his charge, no less wickedly than maliciously, a crime which they take up at their foot,<span class="cite-ref">(569)</span> and invent without all color. But such is the careless security of hypocrites, that they think they may do whatsoever they will, so they color their doings with zeal.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(566)</span></p><p>“ Seditionem... concitaverit,” stirred up sedition. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(567)</span></p><p>“Tumultusos illos sicarios qui se etiam plausibili nomine vociferabant zelotas ,” those tumultuary assassins who, assuming a specious name, boasted of being zelotae, (zealous) </p><p><span class="cite-note">(568)</span></p><p>“Quae factio circiter illud tempus emerserit; imo ex Josephi historia colligitur jamtunc fuisse grassatos ,” about this time that faction had broken out, nay, it appears from Josephus that it had even then made considerable progress, omitted. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(569)</span></p><p>“ Crimen velut ex trivio aereptum,” some charge, picked up, as it were, in the streets. </p></div></div>
