<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>For they bind heavy and intolerable burdens. </em>He does not charge the scribes with oppressing and tyrannizing over souls by harsh and unjust laws; for, though they had introduced many superfluous ceremonies — as is evident from other passages — yet Christ does not at present refer to that vice, because his design is, to compare right doctrine with a wicked and dissolute life. That the Law of God should be called <em>a heavy and intolerable burden </em>is not wonderful, and more especially in reference to our weakness. But though the scribes required nothing but what God had enjoined, yet Christ reproves the stern and rigid manner of teaching which was usually followed by those proud hypocrites, who authoritatively demand from others what they owe to God, and are rigorous in enforcing duties, and yet indolently dispense with the performance of what they so strictly enjoin on others, and allow themselves to do whatever they please. In this sense Ezekiel (<span class="bvs">Eze_34:4</span>) reproaches them for ruling with sternness and rigor. For those who truly fear God, though they sincerely and earnestly endeavor to bring their disciples to obey Him, yet as they are more severe towards themselves than towards others, they are not so rigid in exacting obedience, and, being conscious of their own weakness, kindly forgive the weak. But it is impossible to imagine any thing that can exceed the insolence in commanding, or the cruelty, of stupid despisers of God, because they give themselves no concern about the difficulty of doing those things from which they relieve themselves; and therefore no man will exercise moderation in commanding others, unless he shall first become his own teacher. <span class="cite-ref">(91)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(91)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si premierement il ne se regle luy-mesme, et s’assul jetit aux mesmes choses qu’il commande</span>;” — “if he do not first rule himself, and submit to the same things which he commands.” </p></div></div>
