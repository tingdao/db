<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And Isaiah said </em>Isaiah now relates what was the remedy which he prescribed to Hezekiah. Some think that it was not a remedy, because<em>figs </em>are dangerous and hurtful to <em>boils; </em>but that the pious king was warned and clearly taught by this sign that the cure proceeded from nothing else than from the favor of God alone. As the bow in the sky, <span class="cite-ref">(97)</span> by which God was pleased to testify that mankind would never be destroyed by a flood, (<span class="bvs">Gen_9:13</span>,) appears to denote what is absolutely contrary to this; (for it makes its appearance, when very thick clouds are gathering, and ready to fall as if they would deluge the whole world;) so they think that a plaster, which was not at all fitted for curing the disease, was purposely applied by the Prophet, in order to testify openly that God cured Hezekiah without medicines. But since figs are employed even by our own physicians for maturing a pustule, it is possible that the Lord, who had given a promise, gave also a medicine, as we see done on many other occasions; for although the Lord does not need secondary means, as they are called, yet he makes use of them whenever he thinks proper. And the value of the promise is not lessened by this medicine, which without the word would have been vain and useless; because he had received another supernatural sign, by which he had plainly learned that he had received front God alone that life of which he despaired. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(97)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">L’arc en la nuce</span>.” “The bow in the cloud.” </p></div></div>
