<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Jesus, therefore, knew that they wished to ask him. </em>Though sometimes the Lord appears to speak to the deaf, he, at length, cures the ignorance of his disciples, that his instruction may not be useless. Our duty is to endeavor that our slowness of apprehension may not be accompanied by either pride or indolence, but that, on the contrary, we show ourselves to be humble and desirous to learn. </p></div>
