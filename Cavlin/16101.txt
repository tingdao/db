<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Behold as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters. </em>This similitude is very suitable to the present case. It implies that without the protection of God true believers have no comfort, are completely disarmed and exposed to all manner of wrongs, have neither strength nor courage to resist; in short, that their safety depends entirely upon aid derived from another. We know how shamefully servants were treated in ancient times, and what reproaches might be cast upon them, whilst yet they durst not move a finger to repel the outrage. Being therefore deprived of all means of defending themselves, the only thing which remained for them to do was, what is here stated, to crave the protection of their masters. The same explanation is equally applicable to the case of <em>handmaids </em>Their condition was indeed shameful and degrading; but there is no reason why we should be ashamed of, or offended at being compared to slaves, provided God is our defender, and takes our life under his guardianship; God, I say, who purposely disarms us and strips us of all worldly aid, that we may learn to rely upon his grace, and to be contented ‘with it alone. It having been anciently a capital crime for bond-men to carry a sword or any other weapon about them, and as they were exposed to injuries of every description, their masters were wont to defend them with so much the more spirit, when any one causelessly did them violence. Nor can it be doubted that God, when he sees us placing an exclusive dependence upon his protection, and renouncing all confidence in our own resources, will as our defender encounter, and shield us from all the molestation that shall be offered to us. It is, however, certain that we have here properly the description of a period in which the people of God were reduced to a state of extreme necessity, and brought even to the brink of despair. As to the word<em>hand, </em>it is very well known to be put for <em>help. </em><span class="cite-ref">(76)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(76)</span> “Unto <em>the hand of their masters </em>— if we retain the word <em>hand, </em>it must be taken in the well-known sense which it sometimes bears of <em>side </em>or <em>quarter: </em>and the original word is used (<span class="bvs">Exo_2:5</span>) in the same sense. The phrase will then simply mean, that the eyes of servants look towards their masters, and this agrees with — so <em>our eyes wait upon the Lord. </em>But the Hebrew word also signifies <em>power, </em>(as in <span class="bvs">Deu_32:36</span>,) which may very well be substituted for. <em>hand </em>in this place, the notion being that servants when they are in danger or in distress look to the power of their masters for assistance; and in general expect from them subsistence and <em>defense. </em>” —<em>Cresswell. </em></p></div></div>
