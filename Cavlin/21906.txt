<div class="comment-content"><p>Daniel adds, <em>the kingdom was transferred to the king of the Medes, </em>whom he calls Darius, but Xenophon terms him Cyaxares.

Many add the story of his ordering the infant Cyrus to be slain, but since these matters are uncertain, I leave them undecided. I rather think Darius was the uncle of Cyrus, and also his father-in-law; though, if we believe Xenophon, he was unmarried at the capture of Babylon; for his uncle, and perhaps his father-in-law, had sent him to bring supplies when he was inferior in numbers to the Babylonians and Assyrians.
