<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>They are not in the trouble that is common to man. </em>Here it is declared that the wicked enjoy a delightful repose, and are as it were by special privilege exempted from the miseries to which mankind in general are subject. They also are no doubt involved in afflictions as well as the good, and God often executes his judgments upon them; but, for the express purpose of trying our faith, he always places some of them as it were upon an elevated stage, who appear to be privileged to live in a state of exemption from calamities, as is here described. Now, when we consider that the life of men is full of labor and miseries, and that this is the law and condition of living appointed for all, it is a sore temptation to behold the despisers of God indulging themselves in their luxurious pleasures and enjoying great ease, as if they were elevated above the rest of the world into a region of pleasure, where they had a nest for themselves apart. <span class="cite-ref">(163)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(163)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En un lieu de plaisance, et comme pour avoir leur nid a part</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
