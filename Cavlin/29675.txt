<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14</strong><em>To which he called us</em>. He repeats the same thing, though in somewhat different terms. For the sons of God are not called otherwise than to the belief of the truth. Paul, however, meant to shew here how competent a witness he is for confirming that thing of which he was a minister. He accordingly puts himself forward as a surety, that the Thessalonians may not doubt that the gospel, in which they had been instructed by him, is the safety-bringing voice of God, by which they are aroused from death, and are delivered from the tyranny of Satan. He calls it <em>his </em>gospel, not as though it had originated with him, <span class="cite-ref">(690)</span> but inasmuch as the preaching of it had been committed to him. </p><p>What he adds, <em>to the acquisition </em>or <em>possession of the glory of Christ</em>, may be taken either in an active or in a passive signification — either as meaning, that they are called in order that they may one day <em>possess </em>a glory in common with Christ, or that Christ <em>acquired </em>them with a view to his glory. And thus it will be a second means of confirmation that he will defend them, as being nothing less than his own inheritance, and, in maintaining their salvation, will stand forward in defense of his own glory; which latter meaning, in my opinion, suits better. </p><p><strong>(690)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Non pas qu’il soit creu en son cerueau</span>;” — “Not as though it had been contrived in his brain.” </p></div>
