<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>By whom do your children cast them out? </em>He charges them with passing an unjust and malicious decision, because in the same case they did not decide in a similar manner, but as they were affected towards the persons. Now this inequality shows, that their prevailing motive was not a regard to what is just and right, but blind love or hatred; and that it was even an evidence of wicked self-love ( <span class="lang el-gr">φιλαυτίας</span>) and envy, to condemn in Christ what they praised in their own <em>children </em>By <em>your children </em>some understand the children of the whole nation; and some think that the Apostles are so called, because they were acknowledged to be <em>children, </em>while Christ was treated as if he had been a foreigner. <span class="cite-ref">(121)</span> Others refer it to the ancient Prophets. I have no doubt that he means the <em>Exorcists, </em>who were at that time generally employed among the Jews, as is evident from the Acts of the Apostles, ( <span class="bvs">Act_19:19</span>.) There is reason to believe, that no greater kindness would be exercised in judging of the disciples of Christ than of their Master; and to apply these words to the dead is a forced construction, when they manifestly denote a comparison of the present time. </p><p>There was indeed no statute of the Law for having <em>Exorcists </em>among the Jews; but we know that God, in order to maintain their fidelity to his covenant, and their purity of worship, often testified his presence among them by a variety of miracles. It is even possible that there were persons who cast out devils by calling on the name of the Lord; and the people, having experienced such a display of the power of God, rashly concluded that it was an ordinary office. <span class="cite-ref">(122)</span> The Papists afterwards, resolving not to occupy a lower rank, imitated them by creating <em>Exorcists; </em>and in this way were apes of apes. Besides, it was not necessary that Christ should approve of those <em>exorcisms, </em>in order to point out the malice of those who wished to have them regarded as sacred, and as authorized by the name of God; for the objection was, as we say, of a personal nature. <span class="cite-ref">(123)</span></p><p><em>Therefore they shall judge concerning you. </em>These words are not to be taken literally, but the meaning is: “We need not go far to seek your condemnation. You attribute to Beelzebub the miracles which I have performed, and you praise the same things in your own children. You have at home what is sufficient to condemn you.” But if any one prefer to understand them differently, as reproaching them with the grace of God, which was sometimes exhibited through the Exorcists, I do not greatly object to that view. Though they were greatly degenerated, yet the Lord was pleased not to leave them altogether without evidences of his power, that there might be some testimony to authorize the priesthood in general, and the service of the temple; for it was of the highest importance that there should be evident marks to distinguish them from the superstitions of the Gentiles. I look upon the former view, however, as the natural one. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(121)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et cependant les scribes tenoyent Christ pour estranger</span>;” — “and yet the scribes held Christ to be a foreigner.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(122)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le peuple en a fait un office ordinaire sans regarder comment</span>;”— “the people made it to be an ordinary office, without considering in what manner.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(123)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car l’objection s’addresse a la personne, comme on dit, et non pas a la chose: c’est a dire, Christ ne regarde point ce qu’a la verite il falloit dire de ces Exorcistes, mais ce qu’en pensoyent les scribes</span>;” — “for the objection is addressed to the person, as we say, and not to the thing: that is to say, Christ does not consider what in truth ought to be said of these Exorcists, but what the Jews thought of them.” </p></div></div>
