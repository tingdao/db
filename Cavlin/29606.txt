<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>For this is the will of God</em>. This is doctrine of a general nature, from which, as from a fountain, he immediately deduces special admonitions. When he says that <em>this is the will of God</em>, he means that we have been called by God with this design. “For this end ye are Christians — this the gospel aims at — that ye may <em>sanctify </em>yourselves to <em>God</em>. ” The meaning of the term <em>sanctification </em>we have already explained elsewhere in repeated instances — that renouncing the world, and clearing ourselves from the pollutions of the flesh, we offer ourselves to God as if in sacrifice, for nothing can with propriety be offered to Him, but what is pure and holy. </p><p><em>That ye abstain</em>. This is one injunction, which he derives from the fountain of which he had immediately before made mention; for nothing is more opposed to holiness than the defilement of <em>fornication</em>, which pollutes the whole man. On this account he assigns the <em>lust of concupiscence </em>to the <em>Gentiles, who know not God</em>. “Where the knowledge of God reigns, lusts must be subdued.” </p><p>By the <em>lust of concupiscence</em>, he means all base lusts of the flesh, but, at the same time, by this manner of expression, he brands with dishonor all desires that allure us to pleasure and carnal delights, as in <span class="bvs">Rom_13:14</span>, he bids us <em>have no care for the flesh in respect of the lust thereof</em>. For when men give indulgence to their appetites, there are no bounds to lasciviousness. <span class="cite-ref">(567)</span> Hence the only means of maintaining temperance is to bridle all lusts. </p><p>As for the expression, <em>that every one of you may know to possess his vessel</em>, some explain it as referring to a <em>wife</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(568)</span> as though it had been said, “Let husbands dwell with their wives in all chastity.” As, however, he addresses husbands and wives indiscriminately, there can be no doubt that he employs the term <em>vessel </em>to mean <em>body</em>. For every one has his body as a house, as it were, in which he dwells. He would, therefore, have us keep our body pure from all uncleanness. </p><p><em>And honor</em>, that is, honorably, for the man that prostitutes his body to fornication, covers it with infamy and disgrace. </p><p><strong>(567)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’y a mesure ne fin de desbauchement et dissolution</span>;” — “There is no measure or end of debauchery and wantonness.” </p><p><strong>(568)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Au regard du mari</span>;” — “In relation to her husband.” </p></div>
