<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_27:45</span><strong>.</strong><em>Now from the sixth hour. </em>Although in the death of Christ the weakness of the flesh concealed for a short time the glory of the Godhead, and though the Son of God himself was disfigured by shame and contempt, and, as Paul says, <em>was emptied, </em>(<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>) yet the heavenly Father did not cease to distinguish him by some marks, and during his lowest humiliation prepared some indications of his future glory, in order to fortify the minds of the godly against the offense of the cross. Thus the majesty of Christ was attested by the <em>obscuration of the sun, </em>by the <em>earthquake, </em>by the <em>splitting </em>of the <em>rocks, </em>and the <em>rending </em>of <em>the veil, </em>as if heaven and earth were rendering the homage which they owed to their Creator. </p><p>But we inquire, in the first place, what was the design of the eclipse of <em>the sun? </em>For the fiction of the ancient poets in their tragedies, that the light of the sun is withdrawn from the earth whenever any shocking crime is perpetrated, was intended to express the alarming effects of the anger of God; and this invention unquestionably had its origin in the ordinary feelings of mankind. In accordance with this view, some commentators think that, at the death of Christ, God sent darkness as a Mark of detestation, as if God, by bringing darkness over the sun, hid his face from beholding the blackest of all crimes. Others say that, when the visible sun was extinguished, it pointed out the death of <em>the Sun of righteousness. </em>Others choose to refer it to the blinding of the nation, which followed shortly afterwards. For the Jews, by rejecting Christ, as soon as he was removed from among them, were deprived of the light of heavenly doctrine, and nothing was left to them but the darkness of despair. </p><p>I rather think that, as stupidity had shut the eyes of that people against the light, the <em>darkness </em>was intended to arouse them to consider the astonishing design of God in the death of Christ. For if they were not altogether <em>hardened, </em>an unusual change of the order of nature must have made a deep impression on their senses, so as to look forward to an approaching renewal of the world. Yet it was a terrific spectacle which was exhibited to them, that they might tremble at the judgment of God. And, indeed, it was an astonishing display of the wrath of God that he did not spare even his only begotten Son, and was not appeased in any other way than by that price of expiation. </p><p>As to the scribes and priests, and a great part of the nation, who paid no attention to the eclipse of the sun, but passed it by with closed eyes, their amazing madness ought to strike us with horror; <span class="cite-ref">(283)</span> for they must have been more stupid than brute beasts, who when plainly warned of the severity of the judgment of heaven by such a miracle, did not cease to indulge in mockery. But this is the spirit of stupidity and of giddiness with which God intoxicates the reprobate, after having long contended with their malice. Meanwhile, let us learn that, when they were bewitched by the enchantments of Satan, the glory of God, however manifest, was afterwards hidden from them, or, at least, that their minds were darkened, so that, <em>seeing they did not see, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_13:14</span>.) But as it was a general admonition, it ought also to be of advantage to us, by informing us that the sacrifice by which we are redeemed was of as much importance as if the sun had fallen from heaven, or if the whole fabric of the world had fallen to pieces; for this will excite in us deeper horror at our sins. </p><p>As to the opinion entertained by some who make this eclipse of the sun extend to every quarter of the world, I do not consider it to be probable. For though it was related by one or two authors, still the history of those times attracted so much attention, that it was impossible for so remarkable a miracle to be passed over in silence by many other authors, who have described minutely events which were not so worthy of being recorded. Besides, if the eclipse had been universal throughout the world, it would have been regarded as natural, and would more easily have escaped the notice of men. <span class="cite-ref">(284)</span> But when the sun was shining elsewhere, it was a more striking miracle that Judea was covered with <em>darkness. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(283)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Leur foreenerie noun, doit blen estonner, et nous faire dresser les cheveux en la teste</span>;” — “their madness ought greatly to astonish us, and to make our hair stand on end.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(284)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Plus aisément on l’eust laissé passer sans enquerir la signification</span>;” —”it would more easily have been allowed to pass without inquiring into its meaning.” </p></div></div>
