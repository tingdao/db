<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Say to my soul. </em>Some expound these words thus: Declare to me by secret inspiration; and others, Make me to feel indeed that my salvation is in thy hand. In my opinion, David desires to have it thoroughly fixed in his mind, and to be fully persuaded that God is the author of his salvation. This he was unable, from the present aspect of things, to ascertain and determine; for such is the insensibility and dulness of our natures, that God often delivers us whilst we sleep and are ignorant of it. Accordingly, he makes use of a very forcible manner of expression, in praying that God would grant him a lively sense of his favor, so that being armed with this buckler, he might sustain every conflict, and surmount every opposing obstacle; as if he had said, Lord, whatever may arise to discourage me, confirm me in this persuasion, that my salvation is assuredly in thee; and although temptations drive me hither and thither, recall my thoughts to thee in such a manner, as that my hope of salvation may rise superior to all the dangers to which I shall be exposed; <span class="cite-ref">(704)</span> nay, more, that I may become as infallibly certain as if thou hadst said it, that through thy favor I shall be saved. </p><p><strong>(704)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que l’esperance de mon salut surpasse tous les dangers qui me seront livrez</span>.“ —<em>Fr. </em></p></div>
