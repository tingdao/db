<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>But beware of men </em>Erasmus has inserted the word <em>these, (beware of these men,) </em>supposing that the article has the force of a demonstrative pronoun. <span class="cite-ref">(584)</span> But in my opinion it is better to view it as indefinite, and as conveying a declaration of Christ, that caution ought to be exercised in dealing with men, among whom every thing is full of snares and injuries. But he appears to contradict himself: for the best way of exercising caution would have been to remain at home, and not to venture to appear in public. I reply, he points out here a different sort of caution, — not that terror and alarm which would keep them from discharging their duty, but a dread of being excessively annoyed by sudden calamities. We know that those who are surprised by unexpected afflictions are apt to fall down lifeless. Christ, therefore, desired that his disciples should foresee at a distance what would happen, that their minds might be early prepared for maintaining a conflict. In short, he sounds the trumpet to them, that they may quickly make ready for the battle: for as foresight, when it is excessive or attended by unnecessary anxiety, reduces many to a state of weakness, so many are intoxicated by an indolent security, and, rushing on heedlessly, give way at the critical moment. </p><p><em>For they will deliver you up to councils </em>It may readily be inferred from these words, that the contests of which Christ forewarns the apostles must not be limited to the first journey, in which they met with nothing of this description. The object of this prediction is to prevent them from being ever cast down: for it was no ordinary attainment for poor and despised men, when they came into the presence of princes, to preserve composure, and to remain unmoved by any worldly splendor. He warns them, too, that not in Judea only, but in more distant places, they will be called to fight; and he does so, not merely for the purpose of preparing them by long meditation for that warfare, but that, as instructed and experienced masters, they might not scruple to yield themselves to heavenly guidance. </p><p><em>For a testimony to them and to the Gentiles </em>This means that the will of God must be proclaimed even to foreign princes, and to distant nations, that they may be without excuse. Hence it follows, that the labor of the apostles will not be lost, for it will vindicate the judgment of God, when men shall be convicted of their obstinacy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(584)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Erasme a traduit, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">De ces hornroes: </em><span class="lang fr-fr">pource qu'il luy a sembl, que l'article Grec qul est mis avec le nora denotoit quelques certains hommes</span>.” — “Erasmus translated it, <em>Of these men: </em>because he thought that theGreek article, which is joined to the noun, denoted some particular men<span class="lang el-gr">.” —Προσέχετε δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων </span> literally means <em>but beware of THE men </em>In Calvin's native tongue, <em class="lang fr-fr">les hommes </em> denotes <em>men in general, </em>and in expressing the idea of <em>the men</em>, it became necessary to substitute <em class="lang fr-fr">ces </em> for <em class="lang fr-fr">les </em><em>, </em>in order to avoid the circumlocution of <em class="lang fr-fr">les hommes, dont il s'agit </em> But it would be proper to show cause why<span class="lang el-gr">οἱ ἄνθρωποι </span> should be here viewed as equivalent to<span class="lang el-gr">πάντες ἄνθρωποι. </span> Erasmus, writing in Latin, has supplied a defect of that language by almost the only means which he had in his power, the use of a demonstrative pronoun as a substitute for the definite article. “Cavete ab <em>illis </em>hominibus,” naturally interpreting<span class="lang el-gr">τῶν ἀνθρώπων, </span> as referring to the men who had just been described to the disciples as <em>wolves, </em>and in their intercourse with whom the utmost caution would be indispensable. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
