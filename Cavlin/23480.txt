<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_11:20</span><strong>.</strong><em>Then he began to upbraid. </em>Luke states the time when, and the reason why, Christ uttered such invectives against those cities. It was while he was sending the disciples away into various parts of Judea, to proclaim, as they passed along, that the kingdom of God was at hand. Reflecting on the ingratitude of those among whom he had long discharged the office of a prophet, and performed many wonderful works, without any good result, he broke out into these words, announcing that the time was now come, when he should depart to other cities, having learned, by experience, that the inhabitants of the country adjoining that lake, among whom he had begun to preach the Gospel and perform miracles, were full of obstinacy and of desperate malice. But he says nothing about the doctrine, and reproaches them that his miracles had not led them to repent. <span class="cite-ref">(39)</span> The object which our Lord had in view, in exhibiting those manifestations of his power, undoubtedly was to invite men to himself; but as all are by nature averse to him, it is necessary to begin with repentance. <em>Chorazin </em>and <em>Bethsaida </em>are well known to have been cities which were situated on the lake of Gennesareth. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(39)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que par les miracles ils n’ont point esmeus pour se convertir a repentance</span>;” — “that by the miracles they were not moved to be converted to repentance.” </p></div></div>
