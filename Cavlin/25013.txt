<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>They returned to Galilee </em>The departure to Egypt, I readily acknowledge, came between those events; and the fact mentioned by Luke, that they dwelt in <em>their own city Nazareth, </em>is later, in point of time, than the flight into Egypt, which Matthew relates, (<span class="bvs">Mat_2:14</span>.) But if there was no impropriety in one Evangelist leaving out what is related by another, there was nothing to prevent Luke from overleaping the period which he did not intend to mention, and passing at once to the following history. I am very far from agreeing with those who imagine that Joseph and Mary, after having finished the sacrifice of purification, returned to Bethlehem, to live there. Those persons are foolish enough to believe, that Joseph had a settled abode in a place where he was so little known, that he was unable to find a temporary lodging. Nor is it without a good reason that Luke says, with respect both to Joseph and Mary, that <em>Nazareth </em>was <em>their own city </em>We infer from it, that he never was an inhabitant of Bethlehem, though it was the place of his extraction. <span class="cite-ref">(207)</span> As to the order of time, I shall presently give a more full explanation. </p><p><strong>(207)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien que ce fust le pays de ses ancestres</span>;” — “though it was the country of his ancestors.” </p></div>
