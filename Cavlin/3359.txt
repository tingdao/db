A question may indeed arise as to the latter clause, whether the plural word ought to be restricted to one tribe, <span class="cite-ref">(189)</span> whereas it is elsewhere applied to all. But, if we examine it more closely, it is plain that “his peoples” is equivalent to “of his people,” (<em>populares.</em>) But nothing peculiar will be here required of the priest, if his wife is to be taken only from the children of Abraham. I admit that the chief priests married wives of Other tribes, as Elizabeth, sprung of the tribe of Judah, married Zacharias; but, since the high priest is here distinguished from all others, I do not see how it would follow that a law or privilege referring to him should be observed by the whole posterity of Aaron. On this point, however, I will not contend, if any one thing is otherwise. But assuredly, since he presented the brightest type of Christ, it was right that superior and more perfect holiness should be beheld in him. <span class="cite-ref">(190)</span> For this was the tendency of the restriction, that his wife, not having known another man, should manifest the modesty worthy of her station and quality of sacred honor. If any should object that the marriage of, an old priest with a young girl was ridiculous and somewhat indecorous, as well as liable to many inconveniences; I answer, that special regulations should be so expounded as not to interfere with general principles. If a decrepit old man falls in love with a young girl, it is a base and shameful lust; besides he will defraud her if he marries her. Hence, too, will jealousy and wretched anxiety arise; or, by foolishly and dotingly seeking to preserve his wife’s love, he will cast away all regard for gravity. When God forbade the high priest to marry any but a virgin, he did not wish to violate this rule, which is dictated by nature and reason; but, regard being had to age, He desired that modesty and propriety should be maintained in the marriage, so that, if the priest were of advanced years, he should marry a virgin not too far from his own age: but, if he were failing and now but little fitted for marriage on account of his old age, the law that he should marry a virgin was rather an exhortation to celibacy, than that he should expose himself to many troubles and to general ridicule. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(189)</span> Ainsworth’s literal translation is “a virgin of his peoples.” <em>Fr., “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Ailleurs il se prend pour tout le corps de la lignee d’Abraham</span> :” elsewhere it is taken for the whole body of the race of Abraham. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(190)</span> It is surely strange that <em>C., </em>who here seems to draw out the Christology of the ordinances of the Law with unusual fullness and precision, should have omitted to mention “the mystical union which is between Christ and His Church,” as most luminously set forth in this type. <em>Vide </em>Song, <em>passim</em>. <span class="bvs">Psa_95:0</span>; <span class="bvs">2Co_11:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Eph_5:27</span>; <span class="bvs">Rev_19:8</span>, etc. </p></div></div>
