<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>And to him who wishes to enter into a law-suit with thee. </em>Christ now glances at another kind of annoyance, and that is, when wicked men torment us with law-suits. He commands us, even on such an occasion, to be so patient and submissive that, when our <em>coat </em>has been <em>taken away, </em>we shall be prepared to give up <em>our cloak also. </em>None but a fool will stand upon the words, so as to maintain, that we must yield to our opponents what they demand, before coming into a court of law: for such compliance would more strongly inflame the minds of wicked men to robbery and extortion; and we know, that nothing was farther from the design of Christ. What then is meant by <em>giving the cloak to him </em>who endeavors, on the ground of a legal claim, <span class="cite-ref">(416)</span><em>to take away our coat? </em>If a man, oppressed by an unjust decision, loses what is his own, and yet is prepared, when it shall be found necessary, to part with the remainder, he deserves not less to be commended for patience than the man who allows himself to be twice robbed before coming into court. In short, when Christians meet with one who endeavors to wrench from them a part of their property, they ought to be prepared to lose the whole. </p><p>Hence we conclude, that Christians are not entirely prohibited from engaging in law-suits, provided they have a just defense to offer. Though they do not surrender their goods as a prey, yet they do not depart from this doctrine of Christ, which exhorts us to bear patiently “the spoiling of our goods,” (<span class="bvs">Heb_10:34</span>.) It is, no doubt, rare to find a man who proceeds, with mild and proper feelings, to plead in a court: but, as it is possible for a man to defend a just cause with a view to the public advantage, we have no right to condemn the thing in itself, because it appears to be directed by improper feelings. </p><p>The different modes of expression which are employed by Matthew and Luke, make no alteration in the meaning. A <em>cloak </em>is usually of more value than a <em>coat: </em>and accordingly, when Matthew says, that we ought <em>to give a cloak to him who takes away a coat, </em>he means that, after having sustained a smaller loss, we ought to be prepared to endure a greater. What is stated by Luke agrees with the ancient proverb, “The coat is nearer than the cloak.” <span class="cite-ref">(417)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(416)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sous couleur de proceder par voye de justice</span>;” — “under pretense of proceeding by way of justice.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(417)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que le saye est plus pres de la chair que le manteau</span>.” — “That the coat is nearer the flesh than the cloak.” </p></div></div>
