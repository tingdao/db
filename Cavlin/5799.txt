<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>For </em><span class="cite-ref">(293)</span><em>I lift up my, hand to heaven. </em>Others render it, “When I shall have lifted up my hand,” and read it connectedly with the foregoing verse, that God’s power in destroying and preserving will be manifest, if He raises up His hand to heaven. I do not doubt, however, but that it is the beginning of a new sentence, and that God thus commences, in order to affirm more strongly what He immediately adds respecting the future destruction of their enemies. If, however, any prefer the adverb of time “when,” I have no great objection to offer, provided these clauses are connected, “As soon as I shall have lifted up my hand to heaven, I will put to confusion the enemies of my Church.” </p><p><em>To lift up the hand </em>is explained in two ways; for some suppose it to be a manifestation of power, as men are wont, by the uplifting of their hand, to glow, when they are confident in their strength, and despise their enemies. Others, however, more correctly state it to be a form of adjuration God, who is exalted above all heavens, cannot, indeed, be literally said to lift His hand; but it is no new thing for Him to borrow modes of expression taken from men’s common habits and customs, especially when He suddenly rises again to sublimity, after having appeared for a while to sink below the level of His greatness. Certainly the words which follow contain in them an oath, “I live for ever;” and hence it is probable <span class="cite-ref">(294)</span> that the elevation of His hand was expressive of His taking the oath. </p><p>God swears by His life in a very different sense from men. Sometimes, indeed, He adopts our common modes of speaking, as when He is said to swear by His soul; but here, “I live,” is tantamount to His swearing by Himself, or by His eternal essence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(293)</span><em>Lat., </em>certe; <em>Fr</em>. , car; <em>V</em>. , cum. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(294)</span> I hardly understand the hypothetical form in which this sentence is put, after what <em>C</em>. has already said on this point on <span class="bvs">Exo_6:8</span> ( vol. 1, p. 131,) and on <span class="bvs">Num_14:30</span><em>(ante, </em>p. 81.) Perhaps he merely meant that the coincidence of the adjuration with the uplifting of the hand fixed the sense of the latter expression in this place. </p></div></div>
