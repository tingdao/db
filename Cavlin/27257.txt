<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>41.</strong>Luke repeateth, again, in the end that she was showed openly to the disciples; whence we gather that she was raised again, rather for other men’s sake than for her own. Brain-sick fellows, <span class="cite-ref">(641)</span> who dream that the soul of man is only a blast which vanisheth away until the day of the resurrection, snatch at this place to prove their doting withal. To what end was it (say they) to call back the soul of Tabitha into the prison of the body, where it should suffer such misery, if it were received into blessed rest? As if it were not lawful for God to have respect of his glory as well in death as in life; and as if this were not the true felicity of the godly to live and die to him, yea, as if Christ were not to us a vantage, as well by living as dying, (<span class="bvs">Phi_1:21</span>,) when we dedicate ourselves to him. Therefore, there shall no inconvenience follow, if the Lord had greater respect to his own glory than to Tabitha, although, as the commodity <span class="cite-ref">(642)</span> of the faithful is always annexed to the glory of God, this turned to her greater good that she revived, that she might be a more excellent instrument of God’s goodness and power. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(641)</span> “Fanatici quidam,” certain fanatics. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(642)</span> “Utilitas,” advantage, interest. </p></div></div>
