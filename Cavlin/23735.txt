<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Woe to the world on account of offenses! </em>This passage may be explained in two ways. It may be taken <em>actively</em>, as meaning that Christ pronounces a curse on the authors of <em>offenses; </em>and then by the term <em>world</em>, we must understand all unbelievers. Or it may be taken <em>passively</em>, as meaning that Christ deplores the evils which he perceives to be rapidly coming on <em>the world on account of offenses; </em>as if he had said, that no plague will be more destructive, or attended by more fearful calamities, than the alarm or desertion of many <em>on account of offenses. </em>The latter meaning is more appropriate; for I have no doubt that our Lord, who had spoken on another occasion about offenses, proceeded to discourse more largely on this subject; in order to make his disciples more attentive and watchful in guarding against them. That Satan may not gain advantage over us through our sluggishness, our Lord breaks out into an exclamation, that there is nothing which we ought to dread more than <em>offenses; </em>for as Satan has innumerable kinds of them in his hand, he constantly, and at almost every step, throws new difficulties in our way; while we, through excessive tenderness or sloth, are too ready to yield. The consequence is, that there are few who make tolerable progress in the faith of Christ; and of the few who have begun to walk in the way of salvation, there is scarcely one in ten who has the courage to persevere till he reaches the goal. <span class="cite-ref">(505)</span> Now since Christ intended to strike his disciples with terror <em>on account of offenses</em>, and thus to arouse them to exertion, <em>woe </em>to our indifference, if each of us does not earnestly apply himself to overcome those <em>offenses </em></p><p><em>For offenses must come. </em>To awaken more powerfully their care and anxiety, our Lord reminds his disciples that there is no possibility of walking but in the midst of various <em>offenses; </em>as much as to say, that this is an evil which cannot be avoided. Thus he confirms the former statement; for Christ shows us how great are the inconveniences which arise from <em>offenses</em>, since the Church never will be, and indeed never can be, free from this evil. But he does not state the reason of this necessity, as Paul does, when, speaking of heresies, he says that they arise, <em>that the good may be made manifest</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Co_11:19</span>.) It must be held by us as a fixed principle, that it is the will of God to leave his people exposed to <em>offense</em>, in order to exercise their faith, and to separate believers, as the refuse and the chaff, from the pure wheat. Does any one object or complain, that blame attaches to our Lord for giving loose reins to Satan, to accomplish the destruction of wretched men? It is our duty to think and speak with the deepest reverence of the secret purposes of God, of which this is one, that <em>the world </em>must be disturbed by <em>offenses </em></p><p><em>But woe to the man by whom the offense cometh. </em>After having exhorted his disciples to beware of <em>offenses</em>, he again breaks out against those who occasion them. To impart the greater vehemence to the threatening, he adds, that neither a <em>right eye </em>nor a <em>right hand </em>ought to be spared, if they occasion <em>offense </em>to us; for I explain these words as added for the purpose of amplification. Their meaning is, that we ought to be so constant and so zealous in opposing <em>offenses</em>, that we would rather choose to <em>pluck out our eyes, or cut off our hands, </em>than give encouragement to <em>offenses; </em>for if any man hesitate to incur the loss of his limbs, he spares them at the risk of throwing himself into eternal perdition. What dreadful vengeance then awaits those who by <em>offenses </em>shall bring ruin on their brethren! <span class="cite-ref">(506)</span> As those two verses have been already explained <span class="cite-ref">(507)</span> under <span class="bvs">Mat_5:29</span>, it was sufficient, on the present occasion, to glance at the reason why Christ repeats here the same statement. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(505)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui persevere courageusement iusqu’a la fin</span>;” — “who perseveres courageously to the end.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(506)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lesquels par scandales auront donne occasion de faire perdre et damner leurs freres</span>;” — “who by offenses shall have given occasion to bring ruin and damnation on their brethren.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(507)</span> Harmony, vol. 1 p. 291. </p></div></div>
