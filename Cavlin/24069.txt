<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_26:14</span><strong>.</strong><em>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot. </em>Christ’s admonition was so far from being of any avail for softening the heart of <em>Judas, </em>or producing any change in it for the better, that he immediately went away, without any concern, to transact an infamous bargain with his enemies. It was amazing and prodigious stupidity, that he considered himself to have found, in the expense of the ointment, a fair excuse for so heinous a crime; and next, that, after having been warned by the words of Christ, he did not perceive what he was doing. <span class="cite-ref">(180)</span> The bare mention of the <em>burying </em>ought to have softened a heart of iron; for it would have been easy to infer from it, that Christ offered himself as a sacrifice for the salvation of the human race. But we see in this mirror how great is the blindness of wicked desires, and how powerfully they fascinate the mind. <em>Judas </em>was inflamed with the desire to steal; long practice had hardened him in wickedness; and now when he meets with no other prey, he does not scruple to betray basely to death the Son of God, the Author of life, and, though restrained by a holy admonition, rushes violently forward. </p><p>With good reason, therefore, does Luke expressly say that <em>Satan entered into him; </em>not that the Spirit of God formerly directed him, for he would not have been addicted to theft and robbery, if he had not been the slave of Satan. But Luke means, that he was at that time wholly given up to <em>Satan, </em>so that, like a desperate man, he violently sought his destruction. For though <em>Satan </em>drives us every day to crimes, and reigns in us, when he hurries us into a course of extraordinary wickedness; yet he is said to <em>enter </em>into the reprobate, when he takes possession of all their senses, overthrows the fear of God, extinguishes the light of reason, and destroys every feeling of shame. This extremity of vengeance God does not execute on any but those who are already devoted to destruction. Let us therefore learn to repent early, lest our long-continued harshness should confirm the reign of Satan within us; for as soon as we have been abandoned to this tyranny, his rage will have no bounds. It is particularly worthy of notice, that the cause and source of so great blindness in <em>Judas </em>was avarice, which makes it evident that it is justly denominated by Paul <em>the root of all evils, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Ti_6:10</span>.) To inquire here whether or not <em>Satan entered into Judas </em>bodily is an idle speculation. We ought rather to consider how fearfully monstrous it is, that men formed after the image of God, and appointed to be temples for the Holy Spirit, should not only be turned into filthy stables or sinks, but should become the wretched abodes of Satan. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(180)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que c’estoit qu’il alloit faire</span>;” — “what he was going to do.” </p></div></div>
