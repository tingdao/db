<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Now these are the generations of Ishmael</em>. This narration is not superfluous. In the commencement of the chapter, Moses alludes to what was done for the sons of Keturah. Here he speaks designedly more at large, for the purpose of showing that the promise of God, given in the seventeenth chapter (<span class="bvs">Gen_17:1</span>,) was confirmed by its manifest accomplishment. In the first place, it was no common gift of God that Ishmael should have twelve sons who should possess rank and authority over as many tribes; but inasmuch as the event corresponded with the promise, we must chiefly consider the veracity of God, as well as the singular benevolence and honor which he manifested towards his servant Abraham, when, even in those benefits which were merely adventitious, he dealt so kindly and liberally with him; for that may rightly be regarded as adventitious which was superadded to the spiritual covenant: therefore Moses, after he has enumerated the towns in which the posterity of Ishmael was distributed, buries that whole race in oblivion, that substantial perpetuity may remain only in the Church, according to the declaration in <span class="bvs">Psa_102:28</span>, “the sons of sons shall inhabit.” <span class="cite-ref">(24)</span> Further, Moses, as with his finger, shows the wonderful counsel of God, because, in assigning a region distinct from the land of Canaan to the sons of Ishmael, he has both provided for them in future, and kept the inheritance vacant for the sons of Isaac. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(24)</span> “Filii filiorum habitabunt.” In the English it is, “The children of thy servants shall continue.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
