<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet denounces again on the Israelites the vengeance of God; and as they were become torpid through their own flatteries, as we have already often observed, he here describes the terrible judgement of God, that he might strike fear into the obstinate, so that they might at length perceive that they had to do with God, and begin to dread his power. And this, as we have said, was very necessary, when the Prophets intended to awaken hypocrites; for self- confidence so inebriates them, that they hesitate not to despise all the threatenings of God: and this is the reason why he adopts these three similitudes. He first compares God to a lion, then to a leopard, and then to a bear. <em>I will be, </em>he says, <em>like a lion, like a leopard</em>, and then <em>like a bear </em>God, we know, is in his own nature merciful and kind; when he says that he will be like a lion, he puts on as it were another character; but this is done on account of men’s wickedness, as it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_18:26</span>, </p><p>‘With the gentle, thou wilt be gentle; with the perverse, <LineBreak />thou wilt be perverse.’ </p><p>For, though God speaks sharply and severely through his Prophet, he yet expresses what we ought to remember, and that is, that he thus speaks, because we do not allow him to treat us according to his own nature, that is, gently and kindly; and that when he sees us to be obstinate and unnameable, he then contends with us (so to speak) with the like contumacy; not that perversity properly belongs to God, but he borrows this similitude from men, and for this reason, that men may not continue to flatter themselves when he is displeased with them. <em>I shall </em>therefore <em>be like a lion, like a leopard in the way </em></p><p>As to the word <em>Assur, </em>interpreters take it in various ways. Some render it, Assyria, though it is here written with <em>Kamets: </em>but the Hebrews consider it as an appellative, not the name of a place or country. Some again render it thus, “I will look on them,” and derive it from <span class="lang he-il">שור</span>, <em>shur</em>, and take <span class="lang he-il">א</span><em>aleph</em>, as designative of the future tense. Others derive it from <span class="lang he-il">אשר</span>, <em>asher, </em>and will have it to be in the conjugation <em>Pual: </em>and here they differ again among themselves. Some render it, “I will lay in wait for them:” and others think it to be <em>Shoar, </em>“I will be a layer in wait like a leopard.” But this variety, with regard to the meaning of the passage, is of but little moment; for we see the drift of the Prophet’s object. He intends here to take away from hypocrites their vain confidence, and to terrify them with the apprehension of God’s vengeance which was impending. He therefore says that though God had hitherto spared them, nay, had in a manner kindly cherished them, yet since they continued to provoke his wrath, their condition would soon be very different; for he<em>would come against them like a lion</em>; that is, he would leap on them with the greatest fury; he would also be like a leopard: and a leopard, we know, is a very cruel beast: and, lastly, he compares him to a bereaved she-bear, or, a bereaved bear. </p></div>
