<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>Because he is our God </em>While it is true that all men were created to praise God, there are reasons why the Church is specially said to have been formed for that end, (<span class="bvs">Isa_61:3</span>.) The Psalmist was entitled to require this service more particularly from the hands of his chosen people. This is the reason why he impresses upon the children of Abraham the invaluable privilege which God had conferred upon them in taking them under his protection. God may indeed be said in a sense to have done so much for all mankind. But when asserted to be the Shepherd of the Church, more is meant than that he favors her with the common nourishment, support, and government which he extends promiscuously to the whole human family; he is so called because he separates her from the rest of the world, and cherishes her with a peculiar and fatherly regard. His people are here spoken of accordingly as the <em>people of his pastures, </em>whom he watches over with peculiar care, and loads with blessings of every kind. The passage might have run more clearly had the Psalmist called them <em>the flock of his pastures, </em>and <em>the people of his hand; </em><span class="cite-ref">(48)</span> or, had he added merely — <em>and his flock </em><span class="cite-ref">(49)</span> — the figure might have been brought out more consistently and plainly. But his object was less elegancy of expression than pressing upon the people a sense of the inestimable favor conferred upon them in their adoption, by virtue of which they were called to live under the faithful guardianship of God, and to the enjoyment of every species of blessings. They are called <em>the flock of his hand, </em>not so much because formed by his hand as because governed by it, or, to use a French expression, <em>le Troupeau de sa conduite. </em><span class="cite-ref">(50)</span> The point which some have given to the expression, as if it intimated how intent God was upon feeding his people, doing it himself, and not employing hired shepherds, may scarcely perhaps be borne out by the words in their genuine meaning; but it cannot be doubted that the Psalmist would express the very gracious and familiar kind of guidance which was enjoyed by this one nation at that time. Not that God dispensed with human agency, intrusting the care of the people as he did to priests, prophets, and judges, and latterly to kings. No more is meant than that in discharging the office of shepherd to this people, he exercised a superintendence over them different from that common providence which extends to the rest of the world. </p><p><em>To-day, if you will hear his voice </em><span class="cite-ref">(51)</span> According to the Hebrew expositors, this is a conditional clause standing connected with the preceding sentence; by which interpretation the Psalmist must be considered as warning the people that they would only retain possession of their privilege and distinction so long as they continued to obey God. <span class="cite-ref">(52)</span> The Greek version joins it with the verse that follows — <em>to-day, </em>if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts<em>, </em>and it reads well in this connection. Should we adopt the distribution of the Hebrew expositors, the Psalmist seems to say that the posterity of Abraham were the flock of God’s hand, inasmuch as he had placed his Law in the midst of them, which was, as it were, his crook, and had thus showed himself to be their shepherd. The Hebrew particle <span class="lang he-il">אם</span>, <em>im, </em>which has been rendered <em>if</em>, would in that case be rather expositive than conditional, and might be rendered <em>when, </em><span class="cite-ref">(53)</span> the words denoting it to be the great distinction between the Jews and the surrounding nations, that God had directed his voice to the former, as it is frequently noticed he had not done to the latter, (<span class="bvs">Psa_147:20</span>; <span class="bvs">Deu_4:6</span>.) Moses had declared this to constitute the ground of their superiority to other people, saying, “What nation is there under heaven which hath its gods so nigh unto it?” The inspired writers borrow frequently from Moses, as is well known, and the Psalmist, by the expression <em>to-day, </em>intimates how emphatically the Jews, in hearing God’s voice, were his people, for the proof was not far off, it consisted in something which was present and before their eyes. He bids them recognize God as their shepherd, inasmuch as they heard his voice; and it was an instance of his singular grace that he had addressed them in such a condescending and familiar manner. Some take the adverb to be one of exhortation, and read, <em>I would that they would hear my voice, </em>but this does violence to the words. The passage runs well taken in the other meaning we have assigned to it. Since they had a constant opportunity of hearing the voice of God — since he gave them not only one proof of the care he had over them as shepherd, or yearly proof of it, but a continual exemplification of it, there could be no doubt that the Jews were chosen to be his flock. </p><p><strong>(48)</strong> Hammond, after making a similar remark, adds — “But it is more reasonable to take the explanation from the different significations of <span class="lang he-il">רעה</span>, [the word which Calvin renders <em>pasture</em>, ] as for <em>feeding</em>, so for <em>governing</em>, equally applicable to men and cattle; from whence it is but analogy, that <span class="lang he-il">מרעה</span>, which signifies <em>a pasture</em>, where cattle are fed, should also signify <em>dominion </em>or <em>kingdom</em>, or any kind of <span class="lang el-gr">πολιτεία</span>, wherein a<em>people </em>are <em>governed </em>And then the other part, <em>the sheep of his hand</em>, will be a fit, though figurative, expression; the shepherd that feeds, and rules, and leads the <em>sheep</em>, doing it by his <em>hand</em>, which manageth the rod and staff, <span class="bvs">Psa_23:4</span>. The Jewish Arab reads, ‘the people of his feeding, or flock, and the sheep of his guidance.’” </p><p><strong>(49)</strong> The text reads, “Si tantum nomen Legis posuisset.” This is evidently a mistake of the printer for <em>Gregis </em>. The French version reads — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le Troupeau</span>.” </p><p><strong>(50)</strong> The flock under his conduct or guidance. </p><p><strong>(51)</strong> The ancient Jewish writers frequently apply these words to the Messiah: and they have argued from them, that if all Israel would repent but one day the Messiah would come; because it is said, “To-day, if ye will hear his voice.” </p><p><strong>(52)</strong> Hammond observes, that the particle <span class="lang he-il">אם</span>, <em>im</em>, here rendered <em>if</em>, is in other places often used in an optative signification, as in <span class="bvs">Exo_32:32</span>, “If thou wilt” for “O that thou wouldst forgive them;” and that therefore the rendering here may be, “O that to-day ye would hear his voice;” — a reading, he adds, which “may be thought needful to the making the sense complete in this verse, which otherwise is thought to hang (though not so fitly) on the 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, and not to be finished without it.” He then goes on to say, “But it may be considered also, whether this verse be not more complete in itself by rendering <span class="lang he-il">אם</span>, <em>if</em>, thus: ‘Let us worship and bow down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker; for he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and sheep of his hand, if ye will hear his voice to-day,’ <em>i e</em>. , speedily, — if ye will speedily perform obedience to him, — setting the words in form of a conditional promise, thereby to enforce the performance of the condition on our part. The condition to the performance of which they are exhorted, (verse 6,) is paying God the worship and lowly obedience due to him; and the promise secured to them in this performance, that <em>he </em>will be their <em>God</em>, and they <em>the people of his pasture</em>, <em>etc</em>. ,<em>i e</em>. , that God will take the same care of them that a shepherd does of his sheep; preserve them from all enemies, Midianites, Philistines, Canaanites, etc.” </p><p><strong>(53)</strong> “Non erit proprie conditionalis, sed expositiva; vel pro temporis adverbio sumetur.” — <em>Lat</em>. — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne sera pas proprement conditionnelle, mais expositive; ou bien elle sera prinse pour </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Quand </em>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
