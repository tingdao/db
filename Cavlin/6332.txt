<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And the third lot came up, </em>etc In the lot of Zebulun there is a clear fulfillment of the prophecy of Jacob, which had foretold that they would dwell on the sea-coast. An old man, an exile who could not set a foot on his own land, <span class="cite-ref">(168)</span> assigned a maritime district to the posterity of his son Zebulun. What could be more extravagant? But now, when the lot assigns them a maritime region, no clearer confirmation of his decision could be desired. It was just as if God were twice thundering from heaven. The tribe of Zebulun, therefore, do not occupy the shore of their own accord or by human suffrage, but a divine arrangement fixes their habitation contiguous to the sea. Thus, although men erred, still the light was always seen shining brightly in the darkness. Jacob goes farther, and makes a clear distinction between Zebulun and Issachar. The former tribe will travel far and wide, carrying on trade and commerce; the latter remaining in his tents, will cultivate ease and a sedentary life. (<span class="bvs">Gen_49:13</span>) Hence it is probable that the sea-coast where Zebulun settled, was provided with harbors and well adapted for the various forms of commercial intercourse, <span class="cite-ref">(169)</span> whereas the children of Issachar were contented with their own produce, and consumed the fruits which they had raised by their own labor and culture at home. </p><p>Those who are thought to be well acquainted with these countries, affirm that the land of the tribe of Asher was fertile in corn. <span class="cite-ref">(170)</span> This is in complete accordance both with the letter and the spirit of Jacob’s prophecy. (<span class="bvs">Gen_49:20</span>) From the fact that only a small number of cities are designated by name, we may infer that there were then many ruined cities which were not taken into account, and from the other fact that the people dwelt commodiously, we may also infer that they built many cities, with which it is plain from other passages that the land was adorned. And it is certainly apparent that only a summary of the division is briefly glanced at, and that thus many things were omitted which no religious feeling forbids us to investigate, provided we do not indulge in an excessive curiosity leading to no beneficial result. There cannot be a doubt that those to whom twenty or even only seventeen cities are attributed, had more extensive territories. Therefore, all we have here is a compendious description of the division as it was taken from the general and confused notes of the surveyors. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(168)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estant un vieillard, povre banni, qui n’avoit pas un pied de terre a luy ou il peust marcher</span>;” “Being an old man, a poor exile, who had not a foot of land of his own on which he could walk.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(169)</span> The extent of coast possessed by Zebulun was of very limited extent, but included the large and beautiful bay of Acre, which commences in the north at the promontory on which the town of Acre stands, and is terminated magnificently in the south by the lofty heights of Mount Carmel. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(170)</span> The greater part of it consisted of a rich and undulating plain, diversified by gentle hills, well watered by the Leontes and other streams which derived their supplies from the snowy heights of Lebanon, and sloping gradually to that part of the sea-coast, on which were built the famous cities of Tyre and Sidon. According to Clarke, the plain of Asher and Zebulun bore a considerable resemblance to the southern districts of England. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
