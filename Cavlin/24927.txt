<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob </em>As salvation was promised, in a peculiar manner, to the Jews, (the covenant having been made with their father Abraham, <span class="bvs">Gen_17:7</span>,) and Christ, as Paul informs us, “was a minister of the circumcision,” (<span class="bvs">Rom_15:8</span>,) the angel properly fixed his reign in that nation, as its peculiar seat and residence. But this is in perfect accordance with other predictions, which spread and extend the kingdom of Christ to the utmost limits of the earth. By a new and wonderful adoption, God has admitted into the family of Jacob the Gentiles, who formerly were strangers; though in such a manner that the Jews, as the first-born, held a preferable rank; as it is said, “The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_110:3</span>.) Christ’s throne was, therefore, erected among the people of Israel, that he might thence subdue the whole world. All whom he has joined by faith to the children of Abraham are accounted the true Israel. Though the Jews, by their revolt, have separated themselves from the church of God, yet the Lord will always preserve till the end some “remnants” (<span class="bvs">Rom_11:5</span>;) for his “calling is without repentances” (<span class="bvs">Rom_11:29</span>.) The body of the people is apparently cut off; but we ought to remember the <em>mystery </em>of which Paul speaks, (<span class="bvs">Rom_11:25</span>,) that God will at length gather some of the Jews out of the dispersion. Meanwhile, the church, which is scattered through the whole world, is the spiritual <em>house of Jacob; </em>for it drew its origin from Zion. </p><p><em>For ever </em>The angel points out the sense in which it was so frequently predicted by the prophets that the kingdom of David would be without end. It was only during his own reign and that of Solomon, that it remained wealthy and powerful Rehoboam, the third successor, hardly retained a tribe and a half. The angel now declares that, when it has been established in the person of Christ, it will not be liable to destruction, and, to prove this, employs the words of Daniel, (<span class="bvs">Dan_7:14</span>,) <em>of his kingdom there shall be no end </em><span class="cite-ref">(27)</span> Though the meaning of the words is, that God will for ever protect and defend the kingdom of Christ and the church, so that it shall not perish on the earth “as long as the sun and moon endure,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_72:5</span>,) yet its true perpetuity relates to the glory to come. So then, believers follow each other in this life, by an uninterrupted succession, till at length they are gathered together in heaven, where they shall reign without end. </p><p><strong>(27)</strong> Daniel's prediction referred to runs thus: “His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.” The angel does not employ these words; but his departure from them is not strongly marked, and it can scarcely be doubted that he had this passage in his eye. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
