Accordingly, the kingdom of the Assyrians was formerly like some vast <em>forest</em>; but when <em>the trees </em>have been hewn and thrown down, those which are left are few, and scattered at great distances from each other. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(167)</span><em>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few</em>.
