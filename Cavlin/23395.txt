<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Can the children of the bridegroom mourn? </em>Christ apologizes for his disciples on the score of the season, alleging that God was still pleased to indulge them in joyous feelings, as if they were present at a marriage: for he compares himself to <em>the bridegroom, </em>who enlivens his friends by his presence. <em>Chrysostom </em>thinks that this comparison was taken from the testimony of John the Baptist, <em>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom, </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_3:29</span>.) I have no objection to that view, though I do not think that it rests on solid grounds. Let us be satisfied with Christ’s declaration, that he spares his disciples, and treats them with gentleness, so long as he is with them. That none may envy them advantages which are of short duration, he gives warning that they will very soon be treated with greater harshness and severity. </p><p>The apology rests on this consideration, that fasting and <em>prayers </em>are adapted to sorrow and adversity: extraordinary prayers I mean, such as are here mentioned. Christ certainly intended to accustom them, by degrees, to greater patience, and not to lay on them a heavy burden, till they gained more strength. Hence we ought to learn a twofold instruction. When the Lord sometimes endures the weakness of our brethren, and acts towards them with gentleness, while he treats us with greater severity, we have no right to murmur. Again, when we sometimes obtain relief from sorrow and from vexations, let us beware of giving ourselves up to enjoyments; but let us, on the contrary, remember that the nuptials will not always last. <em>The children of the bridegroom, </em>or <em>of the nuptial bed, </em>is a Hebrew phrase, which denotes the guests at a marriage. <span class="cite-ref">(524)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(524)</span><em>“ </em><em class="lang fr-fr">Les fils de l’espoux, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">(comme il y a en tournant de mot a mot,) par une facon de parler des Hebrieux signifient ceux qui sont appelez au banquet des nopces</span>.” — “<em>The children of the bridegroom, </em>(as the words may be literally rendered,) by a mode of speaking among the Hebrews, denote those who were invited to the marriage banquet.” </p></div></div>
