<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Our recesses full</em>, <em>etc</em>. Some read <em>storehouses</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(272)</span> and I would not reject this meaning. But as the word comes from the same root with <span class="lang he-il">זוה</span>, <em>zavah</em>, which is rendered corner in the previous verse, it seems more agreeable to the etymology to translate the words as I have done — “that the recesses or corners were full.” The participle <span class="lang he-il">מפיקים</span>, <em>mephikim</em>, some take transitively, and read <em>producing</em>, but the meaning comes to the same thing, that abundance of every blessing flowed from all the corners, expression <span class="lang he-il">מזן אל-זן</span>, <em>mizan el-zan</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(273)</span> seems to me to denote the variety and manifold nature of the blessings, rather than, as some interpreters think, so abundant a produce as would issue in the different species being mixed, and forming a confused heap owing to the unmanageable plenty. We have no need to have recourse to this strained hyperbole, and the words as they stand evidently do not favor that sense, for had a confused heap been meant, it would have read simply <span class="lang he-il">זן זן</span>, <em>zan</em>. The meaning in short is, that there prevailed amongst the people such plenty, not only of wheat, but all kinds of produce, that every corner was filled to sufficiency with every variety. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(272)</span><span class="lang he-il">מזוינו</span>, <em>Our garners</em>. This word is to be found in Scripture only once, but it has most probably the same root as <span class="lang he-il">זוית</span>, and it may denote primarily <em>our corners</em>, and then our <em>garners</em>; because garners or storehouses were usually at the ends or corners of edifices.” — <em>Phillips </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(273)</span> Literally, “from kind to kind.” </p></div></div>
