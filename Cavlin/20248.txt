<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah goes on with the same subject; for, after having shown that the calamities of the people were not unknown to God, he now, in an indirect way, exhorts the faithful to deposit their complaints in the bosom of God, and to apply, or appeal to him, as their defender. The design, then, of the Prophet is, (after having explained how grievously the Jews had been afflicted,) to show them that their only remedy was, to flee to God, and to plead their cause before him. </p><p>And this passage is entitled to particular notice, so that we may also learn in extreme evils, when all things seem hopeless, to discover our evils to God, and thus to unburden our anxieties in his bosom. For how is it, that sorrow often overwhelms us, except that we do not follow what God’s Spirit prescribes to us? For it is said in the Psalms, </p><p>“Roll thy cares into God’s bosom, and he will sustain thee, and will not give the righteous to a perpetual change.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_55:23</span>) </p><p>We may, then, by prayer, unburden ourselves, and this is the best remedy: but we murmur, and sometimes clamor, or at least we bite and champ the bridle, according to a common proverb; and, in the meantime, we neglect the chief thing, and what the Prophet teaches us here. </p><p>We ought, then, carefully to mark the design of what is here taught, when it is said, <em>my violence and my flesh </em>be <em>upon Babylon </em>When he adds, <em>Say will </em>(or let) <em>the daughter of Sion, </em>he no doubt shows that the faithful have always this consolation in their extreme calamities, that they can expostulate with God as to their enemies and their cruelty. Then he says, <em>my plunder </em>or violence; some render it “the plunder of me,” which is harsh. But the meaning of the Prophet is not ambiguous, for it follows afterwards, <em>my flesh </em>Then violence was that which was done by enemies. But the people is here spoken of under the name of a woman, according to what is commonly done, <em>Let the inhabitress of Sion say, My plunder and my flesh. </em>By the second word the Prophet shows sufficiently plain what he understood by plunder. <em>My flesh, </em>he says, (even that which the Chaldeans had devoured and consumed,) be <em>on Babylon </em>This is of the greatest weight, for by these words he intimates, that though the Chaldeans thought that they had exercised with impunity their cruelty towards the Jews, yet their innocent blood cried, and was opposed to them as an enemy. </p><p>To the same purpose he afterwards adds, <em>Let Jerusalem say, My blood is upon the Chaldeans. </em></p></div>
