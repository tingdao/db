<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>For Christ is not entered, etc. </em>This is a confirmation of the former verse. He had spoken of the true sanctuary, even the heavenly; he now adds that Christ entered there. It hence follows that a suitable confirmation is required. <em>The holy places </em>he takes for the sanctuary; he says that it is <em>not made with hands, </em>because it ought not to be classed with the created things which are subject to decay; for he does not mean here the <em>heaven </em>we see, and in which the stars shine, but the glorious kingdom of God which is above all the heavens. He calls the old sanctuary the<span class="lang el-gr">ἀντίτυπον, </span> the antitype of the true, that is, of the spiritual; for all the external figures represented as in a mirror what would have otherwise been above our corporeal senses. Greek writers sometimes use the same word in speaking of our sacraments, and wisely too and suitably, for every sacrament is a visible image of what is invisible. </p><p><em>Now to appear, etc. </em>So formerly the Levitical priest stood before God in the name of the people, but typically; for in Christ is found the reality and the full accomplishment of what was typified. The ark was indeed a symbol of the divine presence; But it is Christ who really presents himself before God, and stands there to obtain favor for us, so that now there is no reason why we should flee from God’s tribunal, since we have so kind an advocate, through whose faithfulness and protection we are made secure and safe. Christ was indeed our advocate when he was on earth; but it was a further concession made to our infirmity that he ascended into heaven to undertake there the office of an advocate. So that whenever mention is made of his ascension into heaven, this benefit ought ever to come to our minds, that he appears there before God to defend us by his advocacy. Foolishly, then, and unreasonably the question is asked by some, has he not always appeared there? For the Apostle speaks here only of his intercession, for the sake of which he entered the heavenly sanctuary. </p></div>
