<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_16:4</span><strong>.</strong><em>A wicked and adulterous nation. </em>This passage was explained <span class="cite-ref">(426)</span> under <span class="bvs">Mat_12:38</span>. The general meaning is, that the Jews are never satisfied with any <em>signs</em>, but are continually tickled by a wicked desire to tempt God. He does not call them <em>an adulterous nation </em>merely because they demand some kind of sign, (for the Lord sometimes permitted his people to do this,) but because they deliberately provoke God; and therefore he threatens that, after he has risen from the dead, he will be a prophet like Jonah. So Matthew at least says — for Mark does not mention Jonah — but the meaning is the same; for, strictly speaking, this was intended to serve as a <em>sign </em>to them, that Christ, when he had risen from the dead, would in every place cause the voice of his Gospel to be distinctly heard. </p><p><strong>(426)</strong> See page 93 of this volume. </p></div>
