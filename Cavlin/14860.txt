<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>And all men shall see, and shall declare the work of God. </em>He insists more fully upon the good effects which would result from the judgment executed in leading such as had formerly overlooked a Divine Providence altogether, to catch a spirit of inquiry from the singularity of the spectacle; and acquaint themselves with, and speak one to another of a subject hitherto entirely new to them. He intimates, that the knowledge of what God had so signally wrought would extend far and wide — for he says, <em>all men, </em>etc. The Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">שכל</span><em>, shachal, </em>employed, admits either of the neuter signification, <em>they shall understand, </em>or of the active, <em>they shall cause others to understand. </em>But as it is usual with David to repeat the same thing twice, perhaps the latter or transitive sense is preferable. Another desirable consequence which would flow from the deliverance granted is mentioned in the last verse, that it would afford matter of joy, hope, and holy triumph to the saints, who would be confirmed in expecting the same help from God which he had extended to his servant David. Those formerly called the <em>righteous </em>are now styled <em>the upright in heart, </em>to teach us, that the only righteousness which proves acceptable is that which proceeds from inward sincerity. This truth I have insisted upon at large elsewhere. </p></div>
