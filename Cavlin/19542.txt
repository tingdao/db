The fact that this message was not received by the Jews, was an evidence of extreme and irreclaimable obstinacy. And he enhances their guilt by saying, <em>that ye might provoke me; </em>for he intimates that they were led away to evil by a voluntary purpose, as though they wished to provoke God. The Prophet, then, by saying <em>that ye might provoke me, </em>accuses them of deliberate wickedness.
