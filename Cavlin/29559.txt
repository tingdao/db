<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17</strong><em>Say to Archippus. </em>So far as I can conjecture, this Archippus was, in the mean time, discharging the office of pastor, during the absence of Epaphras; but perhaps he was not of such a disposition as to be sufficiently diligent of himself without being stirred up. Paul, accordingly, would have him be more fully encouraged by the exhortation of the whole Church. He might have admonished him in his own name individually; but he gives this charge to the Colossians that they may know that they must themselves employ incitements, <span class="cite-ref">(482)</span> if they see their pastor cold, and the pastor himself does not refuse to be admonished by the Church. For the ministers of the word are endowed with signal authority, but such at the same time as is not exempt from laws. Hence, it is necessary that they should shew themselves teachable if they would duly teach others. As to Paul’s calling attention again <span class="cite-ref">(483)</span> to his <em>bonds</em>, he intimates by this that he was in no slight degree afflicted. For he was mindful of human infirmity, and without doubt he felt some twinges of it in himself, inasmuch as he was so very urgent that all pious persons, should be mindful of his distresses. It is, however, no evidence of distrust, that he calls in from all quarters the helps that were appointed him by the Lord. The subscription, <em>with his own hand</em>, means, as we have seen elsewhere, that there were even then spurious epistles in circulation, so that it was necessary to provide against imposition. <span class="cite-ref">(484)</span></p><p>END OF THE COMMENTARY ON THE EPISTLE TO<LineBreak />THE COLOSSIANS. </p><p><strong>(482)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’eux — mesmes aussi doyuent faire des remonstrances et inciter leur pasteur</span>;” — “That they must themselves employ remonstrances and stir up their pastor.” </p><p><strong>(483)</strong> Paul had previously made mention of his bonds, in the 3<span class="cite-ref">rd</span> verse of the chapter. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(484)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que des lors on faisoit courir des epistres a faux titre, et sous le nom des seruiteurs de Dieu: a laquelle meschancete il leur estoit force de remedier par quelque moyen</span>;” — “That even then they put into circulation epistles under a false title, and in the name of the servants of God: to which wickedness he was under the necessity of employing a remedy by some means.” </p></div>
