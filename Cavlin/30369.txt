For he who doubts, as one who does not rightly call on God, is unworthy to obtain anything, as we have seen in <span class="bvs">Jas_1:5</span>. Whosoever then really seeks to be heard, must be fully persuaded that he does not pray in vain. </p><p>As James brings before us this special gift, to which the external rite was but an addition, we hence learn, that the oil could not have been rightly used without faith.

Let us then know that it is the only fit remedy for our diseases and other calamities, when we carefully examine ourselves, being solicitous to be reconciled to God, and to obtain the pardon of our sins. </p></div>
