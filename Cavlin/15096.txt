<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>I sought the Lord in the day of my trouble. </em>In this verse he expresses more distinctly the grievous and hard oppression to which the Church was at that time subjected. There is, however, some ambiguity in the words. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">יד</span><em>, yad, </em>which I have translated <em>hand, </em>is sometimes taken metaphorically for <em>a wound; </em>and, therefore, many interpreters elicit this sense, <em>My wound ran in the night, and ceased not, </em><span class="cite-ref">(286)</span> that is to say, My wound was not so purified from ulcerous matter as that the running from it was made to stop. But; I rather take the word in its ordinary signification, which is <em>hand, </em>because the verb <span class="lang he-il">נגרה</span>, <em>niggera, </em>which he uses, signifies not only to run as a sore does, but also to be stretched forth or extended. <span class="cite-ref">(287)</span> Now, when he affirms that he sought the Lord in the day of his trouble, and that his hands were stretched out to him in the night season, this denotes that prayer was his continual exercise, — that his heart was so earnestly and unweariedly engaged in that exercise, that he could not desist from it. In the concluding sentence of the verse the adversative particle <em>although </em>is to be supplied; and thus the meaning will be, that although the prophet found no solace and no alleviation of the bitterness of his grief, he still continued to stretch forth his hands to God. In this manner it becomes us to wrestle against despair, in order that our sorrow, although it may seem to be incurable, may not shut our mouths, and keep us from pouring out our prayers before God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(286)</span> This is the rendering in our English Bible, which Dr Adam Clarke pronounces to be “a most unaccountable translation.” The reading of the margin, however, “my hand,” favours the sense given by our Author. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(287)</span> This is the translation adopted by many critics, and it appears to be the true signification of the passage. Thus Symmachus’ version is, <span class="lang el-gr">ἡ χειρ μου νυκτοςἐκτετατο διηνεκως</span>, “my hand was stretched out by night continually;” and, in like manner, Jerome, “Manus mea nocte extenditur, et non quiescit.” Parkhurst renders the verse thus: “In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; my hand was stretched out by night and ceased not,” or, “without interruption.” With this agree the versions of Horsley, Mant, Fry, Adam Clarke, Walford, and others. The stretching out of the hand was an usual gesture in prayer. Instead of <span class="lang he-il">ידי</span>, the Chaldee reads <span class="lang he-il">עיני</span>, “<em>mine eye </em>trickled down,” which Archbishop Secker and Green think likely to be the true reading. </p></div></div>
