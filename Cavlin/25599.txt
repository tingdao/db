<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_15:10</span><strong>.</strong><em>There will be joy in the presence of the angels. </em>If <em>angels </em>mutually rejoice with each other in heaven, when they see that what had wandered is restored to the fold, we too, who have the same cause in common with them, ought to be partakers of the same <em>joy </em>But. how does he say that the <em>repentance </em>of one ungodly man yields greater joy than the perseverance of many <em>righteous </em>men to <em>angels</em>, whose highest delight is in a continued and uninterrupted course of <em>righteousness </em>? I reply, though it would be more agreeable to the wishes of <em>angels </em>(as it is also more desirable) that men should always remain in perfect integrity, yet as in the deliverance of a sinner, who had been already devoted to destruction, and had been cut off as a rotten member from the body, the mercy of God shines more brightly, he attributes to <em>angels</em>, after the manner of men, a <em>greater joy </em>arising out of an unexpected good. </p><p><em>Over one repenting sinner. </em>The word <em>repentance </em>is specially limited to the conversion of those who, having altogether turned aside from God, rise as it were from death to life; for otherwise the exercise of repentance ought to be uninterrupted throughout our whole life, <span class="cite-ref">(511)</span> and no man is exempted from this necessity, since every one is reminded by his imperfections that he ought to aim at daily progress. But it is one thing, when a man, who has already entered upon the right course, though he stumble, or fall, or even go astray, endeavors to reach the goal; and another thing, when a man leaves a road which was entirely wrong, or only starts in the right course. <span class="cite-ref">(512)</span> Those who have already begun to regulate their life by the standard of the divine law, do not need that kind of <em>repentance </em>which consists in beginning to lead a holy and pious life, though they must groan <span class="cite-ref">(513)</span> under the infirmities of the flesh, and labor to correct them. </p><p><strong>(511)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tant que nous sommes en ce monde</span>;” — “as long as we are in this world.” </p><p><strong>(512)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand celuy qui estoit du tout esgare tourne bride pour commencer a bien faire</span>;” — “when he who had altogether gone astray turns round to begin to do well.” </p><p><strong>(513)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien qu’il soit tousiours necessaire de gemir</span>;” — “though it be necessary for them always to groan.” </p></div>
