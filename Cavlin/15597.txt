<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Great is this sea, and wide in extent </em>After having treated of the evidences which the earth affords of the glory of God, the prophet goes down into the sea, and teaches us that it is a new mirror in which may be beheld the divine power and wisdom. Although the sea were not inhabited by fishes, yet the mere view of its vastness would excite our wonder, especially when at one time it swells with the winds and tempests, while at another it is calm and unruffled. Again, although navigation is an art which has been acquired by the skill of men, yet it depends on the providence of God, who has granted to men a passage through the mighty deep. But the abundance and variety of fishes enhance in no small degree the glory of God in the sea. Of these the Psalmist celebrates especially <em>the leviathan or the whale </em><span class="cite-ref">(196)</span> because this animal, though there were no more, presents to our view a sufficient, yea, more than a sufficient, proof of the dreadful power of God, and for the same reason, we have a lengthened account of it in the book of Job. As its movements not only throw the sea into great agitation, but also strike with alarm the hearts of men, the prophet, by the word <em>sport, </em>intimates that these its movements are only sport in respect of God; as if he had said, The sea is given to the leviathans, as a field in which to exercise themselves. </p><p><strong>(196)</strong> The leviathan, which is described at large in <span class="bvs">Job_40:0</span>., is now generally understood by commentators to be not the whale, but the crocodile, an inhabitant of the Nile. That it should here be numbered with the marine animals, need not surprise us, as the object of the divine poet is merely to display the kingdom of the <em>watery world. </em>Of these wide domains the <em>sea of the Nile </em>forms, in his view, a part. “<span class="lang he-il">ים</span>transfertur ad omnia flumina majora. Est igitur in specie<em>Nilus. </em>Jes. 19, 5; Nab. 3, 8.” — <em>Sire. Lex. Heb. </em>— See volume 3, page 175, note 1. </p></div>
