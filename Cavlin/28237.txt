<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>With regard indeed to the gospel, etc. </em>He shows that the worst thing in the Jews ought not to subject them to the contempt of the Gentiles. Their chief crime was unbelief: but Paul teaches us, that they were thus blinded for a time by God’s providence, that a way to the gospel might be made for the Gentiles; <span class="cite-ref">(368)</span> and that still they were not for ever excluded from the favor of God. He then admits, that they were for the present alienated from God on account of the gospel, that thus the salvation, which at first was deposited with them, might come to the Gentiles; and yet that God was not unmindful of the covenant which he had made with their fathers, and by which he testified that according to his eternal purpose he loved that nation: and this he confirms by this remarkable declaration, — that the grace of the divine calling cannot be made void; for this is the import of the words, — </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(368)</span> They were “enemies” to Paul and the Church, say [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Luther </span>], — to the gospel, says [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>], — to God, says [<span class="bvs">Mede </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>]. The parallel in the next clause, “beloved,” favors the last sentiment. They were become God’s enemies, and alienated through their rejection of the gospel; but they were still regarded as descendants of the Fathers and in some sense on their account “beloved,” as those for whom God entertained love, inasmuch as his “gifts and calling” made in their behalf, were still in force and never to be changed. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
