<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18</strong><em>For he will bless his soul in his lifetime </em>Various meanings have been attached to this verse. Some read, <em>He ought to have blessed his soul during his life </em>Others apply the first clause of the verse to the wicked, while they refer the second to believers, who are in the habit of praising God for all his benefits. Others understand the whole verse as descriptive of believers, but without sufficient ground. There can be little doubt that the reference is to the children of the world. In the first part of the verse it is said that <em>they bless their own soul </em><span class="cite-ref">(233)</span> so long as they live on earth, by which is meant, that they indulge and pamper themselves with earthly pleasures, giving way to the excesses of brutish intemperance, like the rich man, of whom Christ spoke in the parable, who said, </p><p>“Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry,” — (<span class="bvs">Luk_12:19</span>) </p><p>or that they seek their happiness entirely from this world, without cherishing a desire for the life that is to come. Some translate the Hebrew verb, <em>he will do good, </em>and read thus, <em>He will do good to his own soul in his lifetime. </em>But I conceive the phrase to be synonymous in its import with that which is employed by Moses, </p><p>“And it come to pass, that he bless himself in his heart;” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Deu_29:19</span>,) </p><p>that is, flatter himself as if he might despise God with impunity. The inspired penman here represents the stupidity of such as please themselves with a fallacious dream of happiness. In the latter part of the verse the person is changed, and the votary of pleasure is apostrophised; <span class="cite-ref">(234)</span> the prophet insinuating, by the words he uses, that the preposterous pride with which the wicked are inflamed is in part the consequence of the delusive applause of the world, which pronounces them to be happy, and echoes their praises even when they gratify their most unlicensed passions. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(233)</span> That is, themselves. — See note, p. 252. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(234)</span> “There is here a change,” says Walford, “from the oblique to the direct form of speech, by which the writer turns himself to the rich man, who prospers in the world, and says to him, Though you now count yourself happy, and meet with applause from persons of a character resembling your own, yet you shall go to the abode of your fathers, who will never behold the light.” He reads the 19<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, “Thou shalt go to the abode of thy fathers, who will never behold the light.” </p></div></div>
