<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19</strong><em>Wherefore let them that suffer </em>He draws this conclusion, that persecutions ought to be submissively endured, for the condition of the godly in them is much happier than that of the unbelieving, who enjoy prosperity to their utmost wishes. He, however, reminds us that we suffer nothing except according to the permission of God, which tends much to comfort us; when he says, <em>Let them commit themselves to God, </em>it is the same as though he had said, “Let them deliver themselves and their life to the safe keeping of God.” And he calls him a <em>faithful possessor, </em>because he faithfully keeps and defends whatever is under his protection or power. Some render the word “Creator;” and the term <span class="lang el-gr">κτίστης</span> means both; but the former meaning I prefer, for by bidding us to deposit our life with God, he makes him its safe keeper. He adds, <em>in well-doing, </em>lest the faithful should retaliate the wrongs done to them, but that they might on the contrary contend with the ungodly, who injured them, by well-doing. </p></div>
