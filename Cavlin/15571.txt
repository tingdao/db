<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21</strong><em>Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts</em>. By <em>hosts </em>is not to be understood the stars, as some explain it. The subject of the preceding verse is still continued. Nor is the repetition superfluous; for the word <em>hosts </em>teaches us that there are myriads of myriads who stand before the throne of God, ready to receive every intimation of his will. Again, they are called <em>his ministers who do his pleasure, </em>to intimate to us, that they are not there intent in idly beholding God’s glory, but that having been appointed as our ministers and guardians, they are always ready for their work. Instead of <em>word, </em>the term <em>pleasure </em>is here used, and both are employed with much propriety; for although the sun, the moon, and the stars, observe the laws which God has ordained for them, yet being without understanding, they cannot properly be said to obey his word and his voice. The term <em>obey </em>is indeed sometimes transferred to the mute and insensible parts of creation. <span class="cite-ref">(175)</span> It is, however, only in a metaphorical sense that they can be said <em>to hearken to God’s voice, </em>when by a secret instinct of nature they fulfill his purposes. But this in the proper sense is true of angels, who actively obey him upon their understanding from his sacred mouth what he would have them to do. The word <em>pleasure </em>expresses more plainly a joyful and cheerful obedience, implying that the angels not only obey God’s commandments, but also willingly and with the greatest delight receive the intimations of his will, that they may perform what he would have them to do. Such is the import of the Hebrew noun, as has been stated elsewhere. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(175)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Aux creatures muetes et insensibles</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
