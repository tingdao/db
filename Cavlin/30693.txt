<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>But ye, beloved</em>. He shews the manner in which they could overcome all the devices of Satan, that is, by having love connected with faith, and by standing on their guard as it were in their watch-tower, until the coming of Christ. But as he uses often and thickly his metaphors, so he has here a way of speaking peculiar to himself, which must be briefly noticed. </p><p>He bids them first to <em>build themselves on faith</em>; by which he means, that the foundation of faith ought to be retained, but that the first instruction is not sufficient, except they who have been already grounded on true faith, went on continually towards perfection. He calls their faith <em>most holy, </em>in order that they might wholly rely on it, and that, leaning on its firmness, they might never vacillate. </p><p>But since the whole perfection of man consists in faith, it may seem strange that he bids them to build upon it another building, as though faith were only a commencement to man. This difficulty is removed by the Apostle in the words which follow, when he adds, that men build on faith when love is added; except, perhaps, some one may prefer to take this meaning, that men build on faith, as far as they make proficiency in it, and doubtless the daily progress of faith is such, that itself rises up as a building. <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span> Thus the Apostle teaches us, that in order to increase in faith, we must be instant in prayer and maintain our calling by love. </p><p><em>Praying in the Holy Ghost</em>. The way of persevering is, when we are endued with the power of God. Hence whenever the question is respecting the constancy of faith, we must flee to prayer. And as we commonly pray in a formal manner, he adds, <em>In the Spirit</em>; as though he had said, that such is our sloth, and that such is the coldness of our flesh, that no one can pray aright except he be roused by the Spirit of God; and that we are also so inclined to diffidence and trembling, that no one dares to call God his Father, except through the teaching of the same Spirit; for from him is solicitude, from him is ardor and vehemence, from him is alacrity, from him is confidence in obtaining what we ask; in short, from him are those unutterable groanings mentioned by Paul (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:26</span>.) It is not, then, without reason that Jude teaches us, that no one can pray as he ought without having the Spirit as his guide. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(202)</span> It is better to take “faith” here metonymically for the word or doctrine of faith, the gospel; and the sense would be more evident, were we to render <span class="lang el-gr">ἑαυτοὺς</span>, “one another,” as it means in <span class="bvs">1Th_5:13</span></p><p><span class="cite-note">20.</span>“But ye, beloved, building one another on your most holy faith, <LineBreak />(on the most holy doctrine which you believe,) praying by the <LineBreak /><span class="cite-note">21.</span>Holy Spirit, keep one another in love to God, <LineBreak />waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life. <LineBreak />And on some, indeed, have compassion, making a difference; <LineBreak />but others save with fear,” etc. </p><p>The whole passage would read thus better, when their duty towards one another is specifically pointed out. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
