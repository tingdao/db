<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>For the Son of God </em>Here we have the proof — because his preaching <span class="cite-ref">(283)</span> contained nothing but Christ alone, who is the eternal and immutable truth of God. The clause <em>preached by us </em>is emphatic. For, as it may be, and often does happen, that Christ is disfigured by the inventions <span class="cite-ref">(284)</span> of men, and is adulterated, as it were, by their disguises, he declares that it had not been so as to himself or his associates, but that he had sincerely and with an integrity that was befitting, held forth Christ pure and undisguised. Why it is that he makes no mention of Apollos, while he mentions by name Timotheus and Silvanus, does not exactly appear; unless the reason be, as is probable, that the more that individuals were assailed by the calumnies of the wicked, <span class="cite-ref">(285)</span> he was so much the more careful to defend them. </p><p>In these words, however, he intimates that his whole doctrine was summed up in a simple acquaintance with Christ alone, as in reality the whole of the gospel is included in it. Hence those go beyond due limits, who teach anything else than Christ alone, with whatever show of wisdom they may otherwise be puffed up. For as he is the <em>end of the law, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_10:4</span>,) so he is the head — the sum — in fine, the consummation — of all spiritual doctrine. </p><p>In the <em>second </em>place, he intimates that his doctrine respecting Christ had not been variable, or ambiguous, so as to present him from time to time in a new shape after the manner of Proteus; <span class="cite-ref">(286)</span> as some persons make it their sport to make changes upon him, <span class="cite-ref">(287)</span> just as if they were tossing a ball to and fro with their hand, simply for the purpose of displaying their dexterity. Others, with a view to procure the favor of men, present him under various forms, while there is still another class, that inculcate one day what on the next they retract through fear. Such was not Paul’s Christ, nor can that of any true apostle <span class="cite-ref">(288)</span> be such. Those, accordingly, have no ground to boast that they are ministers of Christ, who paint him in various colors with a view to their own advantage. For he alone is the true Christ, in whom there appears that uniform and unvarying <em>yea, </em>which Paul declares to be characteristic of him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(283)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il dit donc que sa parolle n’a point este oui et non, c’est à dire variable; pource que sa predication</span>,” etc.; — “He says, then, that his word had not been yea and nay, that is to say, variable; because his preaching,” etc. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(284)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et mensonges</span>;” — “And fallacies.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(285)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Des calomniateurs et mesdisans</span>;” — “By calumniators and slanderers.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(286)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En sorte qu’il l’ait transfiguré, maintenant en vne sorte, tantost en vne autre, comme les Poëtes disent que Proteus se transformoit en diuerses sortes</span>;” — “So as to present him in different shapes, now in one form, then in another, as the poets say that Proteus transformed himself into different shapes.” The following poets (among others) make mention of the “shape — changing” Proteus: — <em>Virgil</em>, (Georg. 4:387); <em>Ovid</em>, (Met. 8:730); <em>Horace</em>, (Sat. 2:3, 71, Ep.
