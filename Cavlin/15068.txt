<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Give not to the beast the soul of thy turtle dove. </em>The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">חית</span><em>, chayath, </em>which we translate <em>beast, </em>signifies sometimes <em>the soul </em>or <em>life, </em>and so some explain it in the second clause of this verse, where it again occurs. But it is here unquestionably to be taken either for <em>a wild beast </em>or for a <em>multitude. </em>Understood in either of these ways, this form of expression will contain a very apposite comparison between the life of a weak and timorous bird, and a powerful army of men, or a cruel beast. The Church is compared to <em>a turtle dove </em><span class="cite-ref">(243)</span> for, although the faithful consisted of a considerable number, yet so far were they from matching their enemies, that, on the contrary, they were exposed to them as a prey. It is next added, <em>Forget not the soul or congregation of thy poor ones </em>The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">חית</span>, <em>chayath, </em>is again employed, and there is an elegance when, on account of its ambiguity, it is used twice in the same verse, but in different senses. I have preferred translating it <em>congregation, </em>rather than <em>soul, </em>because the passage seems to be a prayer that it would please God to watch over and defend his own small flock from the mighty hosts of their enemies. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(243)</span> As none of the ancient versions have “turtle dove,” and as the reading of the LXX. is, <span class="lang el-gr">ἐξομολογουμένην σοι</span>,<em>confessing thee</em>, it has been thought by some in a high degree probable that the word <span class="lang he-il">תורך</span>, <em>torecha</em>, <em>thy turtle dove </em>in our present Hebrew copies, should be <span class="lang he-il">תודך</span>, <em>todecha</em>, <em>confessing thee</em>; an error which transcribers might easily have committed, by writing <span class="lang he-il">ר</span>, <em>resh</em>, instead of <span class="lang he-il">ד</span>, <em>daleth </em>Houbigant, who approves of this opinion, boldly pronounces the other, which represents the people of God under the figure of <em>a turtle dove</em>, to be “putidum et aliunde conquisitum.” But, says Archbishop Secker, “<em>Turtle dove</em>, which Houbigant calls <em>putidum</em>, should not be called so, considering that, <span class="lang he-il">יונתי</span>, <span class="bvs">Son_2:14</span>, is the same thing.” The passage, as it now stands, agrees with other texts of Scripture which represent the people of God under the image of a bird, <span class="bvs">Num_24:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Jer_22:23</span>. The turtle dove is a defenceless, solitary, timid, and mournful creature, equally destitute of skill and courage to defend itself from the rapacious birds of prey which thirst for its blood. And this gives a very apt and affecting representation of the state of the Church when this psalm was written. She was in a weak, helpless, and sorrowful condition, in danger of being speedily devoured by the inveterate and implacable enemies, who, like birds of prey, were besetting her on all sides, eagerly intent upon her destruction. “With the most plaintive earnestness she pleads her cause with the Almighty, through this and the following verses; continually growing more importunate in her petitions as the danger increases. While speaking, she seems in the last verse to hear the tumultuous clamours of the approaching enemy growing every minute louder as they advance; and we leave the ‘turtle dove’ without the Divine assistance, ready to sink under the talons of the rapacious eagle.” — <em>Mant </em></p><p>“The Psalmist’s expression, <em>thy turtle dove</em>, may perhaps be farther illustrated from the custom, ancient and modern, of keeping doves as favourite birds, (see Theocritus, 5. 96; and Virgil, <em>Eclog</em>. 3, 5, 68, 69,) and from the care taken to secure them from such animals as are dangerous to them.” — <em>Merrick </em>’<em>s Annotations</em>. </p></div></div>
