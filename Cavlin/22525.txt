<div class="comment-content"><p>It follows, <em>And thou shouldest not stand on the going forth</em>. The word <span class="lang he-il">פרק</span><em>perek </em>signifies to break, to dissipate, to rend; hence <span class="lang he-il">פרק</span><em>perek</em>, as a noun, in Hebrew means rending and breaking. Therefore some take it metaphorically for a place where two ways meet, when one road is cut or divided into two. When the two meet then there is a going forth by two ways; hence they take <span class="lang he-il">פרק</span>, <em>perek, </em>for such a place. But we may simply take it for the rending of the people. Though I am certainly pleased with the first explanation, yet I do not confine the word to that meaning; and I prefer the idea of going forth, as it harmonizes better with the context: Thou hast<em>stood </em>then <em>on the going forth; </em>and for what purpose? <em>To destroy those who had escaped, and to stop or to deliver up his remaining captives in the day of affliction. </em>In short, the Prophet means that the Idumeans occupied all the ways, to intercept the miserable exiles, to whom flight was the only way of safety. </p><p>As then the miserable Jews tried by winding outlets to provide for their own safety, the Prophet says that they were intercepted by the Idumeans, lest any of them should escape, and that they were stopped, that afterwards they might be slain by their enemies. Inasmuch as the Assyrians and the Chaldeans were a people far remote from Judea, it is probable that the roads were unknown to them, and that they were afraid of being entrapped; but the Idumeans, who were familiarly acquainted with all their roads, could stand at all the outlets. Some give the following explanation, but it is too frigid: <em>Thou shouldest not stand for the rending of thy brethren, </em>that is, thou should not stand still, but strive to extend a helping hand to the distressed: but this, as I have said, is too frigid and strained. <em>Thou shouldest not </em>then stand on the going forth <em>of the roads to destroy </em>We now see what the Prophet had in view; to destroy, he says, and whom did they destroy? Even those <em>who had </em>already <em>escaped. </em>Expressly then is pointed out here the cruelty to which I have referred, that the Idumeans were not contented with the ruin of the city, and the great slaughter which had been made; but in case any had stealthily escaped, they occupied the outlets of the roads, that they might not flee away: and the same thing is meant when he adds, that all were betrayed or stopped who had remained alive in the day of affliction. </p><p>We now understand the Prophet’s meaning; — that the Idumeans could not complain that God was too severe with them, when he reduced them to nothing, because they had given examples of extreme cruelty towards their own brethren, and at a time when their calamities ought to have obliterated all hatred and old enmities, as it is usually the case even with men the most alienated from one another. Let us proceed — </p></div>
