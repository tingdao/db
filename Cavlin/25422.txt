<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_11:16</span><strong>.</strong><em>And others tempting sought from him a sign. </em>Something similar to this is afterwards related by Matthew, (<span class="bvs">Mat_16:4</span>,) and by Mark, (<span class="bvs">Mar_8:11</span>.) Hence it is evident, that Christ repeatedly attacked them on this subject, so that there was no end to the wickedness of those men who had once resolved <span class="cite-ref">(163)</span> to oppose the truth. There can be no doubt that they ask a sign, in order to plead, as a plausible pretense for their unbelief, that Christ’s calling has not been duly attested. They do not express such submissiveness as to be prepared to yield to two or three miracles, and still less to be satisfied with a single miracle; but as I hinted a little before, they apologize for not believing the Gospel on this pretense, that Christ shows no sign of it from heaven. <span class="cite-ref">(164)</span> He had already performed miracles before their eyes sufficiently numerous and manifest; but as if these were not enough for the confirmation of doctrine, they wish to have something exhibited from heaven, by which God will, as it were, make a visible appearance. They call him <em>Master, </em>according to custom; for such was the appellation given at that time to all scribes and expounders of the law. But they do not acknowledge him to be a prophet of God, till he produce a testimony from heaven. The meaning therefore is: “Since thou professest to be a teacher and Master, if thou desirest that we should be thy disciples, let God declare from heaven that He is the Author of thy teaching, and let Him confirm thy calling by a miracle.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(163)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui une fois s’estoyent endurcis</span>;” — “who had once become hardened.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(164)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Christ ne leur monstre aucun signe d’enhaut qui soit pour seelet ceste doctrine</span>;” — “that Christ shows them no sign from above that is sufficient to seal this doctrine.” </p></div></div>
