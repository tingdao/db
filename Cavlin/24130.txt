<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>75.</strong><em>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus. </em>To the voice of <em>the cock, </em>Luke informs us, there was also added the <em>look </em>of Christ; for previously — as we learn from Mark — he had paid no attention to the <em>cock </em>when <em>crowing. </em>He must, therefore, have received the <em>look </em>from Christ, in order that he might come to himself. We all have experience of the same thing in ourselves; for which of us does not pass by with indifference and with deaf ears — I do not say the varied and numerous songs of birds which however, excite us to glorify God — but even the voice of God, which is heard clearly and distinctly in the doctrine of the Law and of the Gospel? Nor is it for a single day only that our minds are held by such brutal stupidity, but it is perpetual until he who alone turns the hearts of men deigns to <em>look </em>upon us. It is proper to observe, however that this was no ordinary <em>look, </em>for he had formerly <em>looked </em>at Judas who, after all, became no better by it. But in <em>looking at Peter, </em>he added to his eyes the secret efficacy of the Spirit, and thus by the rays of his grace, penetrated into his heart. Let us therefore know, that whenever any one has fallen, his repentance will never begin, until the Lord has <em>looked </em>at him. </p><p><em>And he went out and wept bitterly. </em>It is probable that Peter <em>went out </em>through fear, for he did not venture to <em>weep </em>in presence of witnesses; and here he gave another proof of his weakness. Hence we infer that he did not deserve pardon by satisfaction, but that he obtained it by the fatherly kindness of God. And by this example we are taught that we ought to entertain confident hope, though our repentance be lame; for God does not despise even weak repentance, provided that it be sincere. Yet Peter’s tears, which he shed in secret, testified before God and the angels that his repentance was true; for, having withdrawn from the eyes of men, he places before him God and the angels; and, therefore, those tears flow from the deep feelings of his heart. This deserves our attention; for we see many who shed tears purposely, so long as they are beheld by others, but who have no sooner retired than they have dry eyes. Now there is no room to doubt that tears, which do not flow on account of the judgment of God, are often drawn forth by ambition and hypocrisy. </p><p>But it may be asked, Is weeping requisite in true repentance? I reply, Believers often with dry eyes groan before the Lord without hypocrisy, and confess their fault to obtain pardon; but in more aggravated offenses they must be in no ordinary degree stupid and hardened, whose hearts are not pained by grief and sorrow, and who do not feel ashamed even so far as to shed tears. And, therefore Scripture, after having convicted men of their crimes, exhorts them to <em>sackcloth and ashes, </em>(<span class="bvs">Dan_9:3</span>; <span class="bvs">Jon_3:6</span>; <span class="bvs">Mat_11:21</span>.) </p></div>
