<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>The wicked shall be turned into hell. </em>Many translate the verb in the optative mood, <em>Let the wicked be turned into hell, </em>as if it were an imprecation. But, in my judgment, David here rather confirms himself and all the godly with respect to the future, declaring that whatever the wicked may attempt, it will have a termination disastrous to themselves. By the word <em>turn </em>he means that the issue will be far otherwise than what they imagine; for there is implied in it a tacit contrast between the height of their presumption and the depth of their fall. As they have no fear of God, they exalt themselves above the clouds; and then, as if they had “made a covenant with death,” according to the language of Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_28:15</span>) they become so much the more arrogant and presumptuous. But when we see them raging without apprehension of danger, the prophet warns us that their madness carries them headlong, so that, at length, they fall into the grave, from which they thought themselves to be a great way off. Here, then, is described to us the sudden and unexpected change, by which God, when he pleases, restores to order things which were in confusion. When, therefore, we see the wicked flying aloft devoid of all fear, let us, by the eyes of faith, behold the grave which is prepared for them; and rest assured that the hand of God, although it is unseen, is very near, which can turn them back in the midst of their course in which they aim at reaching heaven, and make them tumble into hell in a moment. The meaning of the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שאולה</span>,<em>sheolah, </em>is doubtful, but I have not hesitated to translate it <em>hell </em><span class="cite-ref">(180)</span> I do not find fault with those who translate it <em>the grave, </em>but it is certain that the prophet means something more than common death, otherwise he would here say nothing else with respect to the wicked than what would also happen to all the faithful in common with them. Though then, he does not speak in express terms of eternal destruction, but only says, <em>They shall be turned into the grave, </em>yet, under the metaphor of <em>the grave, </em>he intimates that all the ungodly shall perish, and that the presumption with which, by every unlawful means, they raise themselves on high to trample righteousness under foot, and to oppress the innocent, shall bring upon them ruin and perdition. The faithful, also, it is true, descend into the grave, but not with such fearful violence as plunges them into it without hope of coming out again. So far is this from being the case, that even when shut up in the grave, they dwell already in heaven by hope. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(180)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le mot Hebreu, pour lequel nous avons traduit </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Enfer </em><span class="lang fr-fr">signifie aussi Sepulchre; mais j’ay mieux aime retenir ceste signification</span>. —<em>Fr. </em>“The Hebrew word which we have translated <em>hell </em>also signifies <em>the grave; </em>but I have preferred to retain the former meaning of the word.” </p></div></div>
