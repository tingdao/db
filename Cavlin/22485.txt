<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet touches the Israelites here, in an indirect way, for taking such delight in their superstitions as to sing in their prosperity, as though God was favorable to them; for the unbelieving are wont to misconstrue both the hatred and the favor of God by the present appearance of things. When the Turks enjoy prosperity, they boast that God is on their side: we see also that the Papists draw the same conclusion. It is the disposition of men not to look so much on themselves as on external circumstances. When, therefore, God indulges them for a time, though they be more than usually wicked, they yet doubt not but that God is favorable to them. So the Sodomites, to the very time in which they were overwhelmed by sudden destruction, thought that they had peace with heaven, (<span class="bvs">Gen_19:14</span>): this also is the reason why Isaiah says, that the ungodly had made, as it were, a covenant with hell and death, (<span class="bvs">Isa_28:15</span>) and we know what Christ says of the time of Noah, that they then heedlessly feasted and built sumptuous houses, (<span class="bvs">Mat_24:38</span>) Such carnal security has prevailed almost in all ages. But a special vice is here noticed by the Prophet, namely, that the people of Israel sang songs in their temples, as though they meant designedly to mock God: for the voices of the Prophets resounded daily, and uttered grievous and terrible threatening; but the people in the meantime sang in their temples. In the same way the Papists act in the present day; while they bellow and chant, they think that God is twice or three times pacified; and they also congratulate themselves in their temples, when they have everything prosperous. This abuse, then, is what the Prophet refers to when he says, <em>Howlings shall be the songs of the temple </em>For melody he mentions howling, as though he said, “God will turn your songs to lamentations, though they be now full of joy.” </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>For many a carcass shall be cast down in every place: </em>but I prefer to render the word passively, “Cast down everywhere with silence shall be many carcases” <span class="cite-ref">(54)</span>. By these words he intimates that there would be such a slaughter as would prevent them from burying the dead bodies. We have said in another place that the right of burial is commonly observed even by enemies; for it is more than hostility to rage against the dead: and all who wish not to be deemed wholly barbarous either bury their dead enemies, or permit them to be buried; and there is a sort of an understanding on this point among enemies, and the right of burial has been usually observed in all ages, and held sacred among all nations. When therefore dead bodies are thrown down in silence, it is an evidence of a most grievous calamity. We hence see why the Prophet distinctly expresses here, that many a dead body would be cast down in every place in silence, that is, that there would be no burying of the dead. But as we see men, though a hundred times proved guilty, yet quarreling with God, when he executes rather a grievous punishment, the Prophet now contends with the Israelites, and again repeats what we have before noticed, — that God did not deal cruelly with them, and that though he should consume and obliterate the whole people, it would yet be for just reasons, inasmuch as they had reached the very extremities of wickedness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(54)</span> The literal rendering of the verse seems to be this — </p><p><em>And they shall howl the songs of the temple: </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Many a dead body </em>shall be <em>in every place; </em>—<em><LineBreak /></em><em>“Cast </em>it<em>away, be silent.” </em></p><p>The expressions are abrupt, but very striking. What would be commonly said is mentioned, “Cast it away,” etc. <em>Newcome </em>translates as follows: — </p><p><em>“ </em>There shall be <em>many dead bodies in every place: </em><em><LineBreak /></em>And men shall say<em>, Cast forth, be silent.” </em></p><p>Very tame is this, compared with the original literally rendered. To introduce, <em>And men shall say, </em>lessens the force of the sentence. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
