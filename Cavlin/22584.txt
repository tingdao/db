<div class="comment-content"><p>And he afterwards adds, that this going forth of God would be terrible, <em>Melt, </em>he says, <em>shall the mountains under him </em>It hence appears, that the Prophet did not speak in the last verse of the departure of God, as though he was going to forsake his own temple, but that he, on the contrary, described his going forth from the temple, that he might ascend his tribunal and execute punishment on the whole people, and thus, in reality, prove that he would be a judge, because he had been very daringly despised. Hence he says, <em>Melt shall the mountains under him, the valleys shall be rent, or cleave, as wax before the fire, as waters rolling into a lower place </em><span class="cite-ref">(63)</span> The Prophets do not often describe God in a manner so awful; but this representation is to be referred to the circumstance of this passage, for he sets forth God here as the judge of the people: it was therefore necessary that he should be exhibited as furnished and armed with powers that he might stake such vengeance on the Jews as they deserved. And other similar passages we shall hereafter meet with, and like to those which we found in Hosea. God then is said to melt the mountains, and he is said to strike the valleys with such terror that they cleave under him; in short, he is said so to terrify all elements, that the very mountains, however stony they may be, melt like wax or like waters which flow, — because he could not otherwise produce a real impression on a people so obstinate, and who, as it has been said, so flattered themselves even in their vices. </p><p>We may further easily learn what application to make of this truth in our day. We find the Papists boasting of the title Church, and, in a manner, with vain confidence, binding God to themselves, because they have baptism, though they have adulterated it with their superstitions; and then, they think that they have Christ, because they still retain the name of a Church. Had the Lord promised that his dwelling would be at Rome, we yet see how foolish and frivolous would be such boasting: for though the temple was at Jerusalem, yet the Lord went forth thence to punish the sins of the people, yea, even of the chosen people. We further know, that it is folly to bind God now to one place, for it is his will that his name should be celebrated without any difference through the whole world. Wheresoever, then, the voice of the Gospel sounds, God would have us to know that he is present there. What the Papists then proudly boast of — that Christ is joined to them — will turn out to their own condemnation; — why so? Because the Lord will prove that he is the avenger of so impious and shameful a profanation, as they not only presumptuously lay claim to his name, but also tear it in pieces, and contaminate it with their sacrilegious abominations. </p><p>Again, since God is said to melt the mountains with his presence, let us hence learn to rouse up all our feelings whenever God comes forth not that we may flee to a distance from him, but that we may reverently receive his word, so that he may afterwards appear to us a kind and reconciled Father. For when we become humble, and the pride and height of our flesh is subdued, he then immediately receives us, as it were, into his gentle bosom, and gives us an easy access to him, yea, he invites us to himself with all possible kindness. That the Lord then may thus kindly receive us, let us learn to fear as soon as he utters his voice: but let not this fear make us to flee away but only humble us, so that we may render true obedience to the word of the Lord. It follows — </p><p><strong>(63)</strong> These two similes, as observed by <em>Marckius </em>and others, refer not to the same thing, but to the two things previously mentioned,—the wax, to the mountains,—and the waters, to the valleys. This kind of order, in a sentence, is common in Hebrew. The <em>Septuagint </em>presents an instance, not uncommon, of an attempt to reconcile what, from not apprehending the sense, appeared incongruous; for <em>motion </em>is ascribed to the mountains— <span class="lang el-gr">σαλευθησεται τα ορη</span>, and <em>melting </em>to the valleys—<span class="lang el-gr">τακησονται</span>, quite contrary to the meaning of the words in Hebrew. <em>Newcome </em>renders the last line thus, — </p><p>“As waters poured down a steep place.” </p><p><em>Henderson </em>renders the last word, “a precipice;” and <em>Marckius, declive </em>—”a declivity.” I would give this version of the whole verse, — </p><p>For, behold, Jehovah shall go forth from his place; <LineBreak />Yea, he shall descend and tread on the high places of the land; <LineBreak />And dissolve shall the mountains under him, <LineBreak />And the valleys shall burst forth; <LineBreak />Like the wax before the fire, <LineBreak />Like waters rolling down a declivity. </p><p>The verb <span class="lang he-il">בקע</span> is applied to express the bursting out of waters from a fountain, of the young when emerging from the egg, and of light dispelling darkness. It is here in Hithpael, and only in one other place, <span class="bvs">Jos_9:13</span>; where it means the bursting of wine bottles, made of leather. The word <span class="lang he-il">מורד</span> is going down, descent, declivity, <span class="lang el-gr">καταβασις</span>, <em>Sept. </em>See <span class="bvs">Jos_10:11</span>; <span class="bvs">Jer_48:5</span></p><p>“Do men trust to the height and strength of mountains, as if they were sufficient to bear up their hopes and bear off their fears? They shall be <em>molten </em>under him. — Do they trust to the fruitfulness of the valleys and their products? They shall be cleft, or rent, — and be wasted away as the ground is by the waters that are poured down a steep place.” — <em>Henry. </em></p></div>
