<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>In righteousness. </em>He means that God will be the maker and architect of his Church. I am aware that there are some who explain it differently, and who think that “righteousness” means “good­works.” And indeed that exposition has some plausibility, arising from the Prophet having spoken about doctrine; for we are taught for this very purpose, that we may lead a pious and holy life. But the Prophet’s meaning was different, namely, that the Church shall be restored under God’s guidance, who wishes to be its guardian and defender, he contrasts “righteousness” with the violence and oppression by which the Church has been thrown down, or, at least, he expresses “stability,” as if he had said that it shall not be a frail building, or one that might impose on men for a short time by mere deceitfulness of appearance; because God will sincerely defend his work, and, being “righteous,” will not only restore it completely, but will afterwards preserve it in safety for a long period. Thus, although men are leagued in every way for the destruction of the Church, they will gain nothing; for the Lord guards her by his “righteousness.” We have formerly <span class="cite-ref">(73)</span> seen this form of expression; and on this account I think that the interpretation which I have given is more simple, though some may think that another interpretation is more plausible. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(73)</span> ‘See Commentary on Isaiah, Vol. 1, p. 488; 3, p. 411. </p></div></div>
