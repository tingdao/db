Balaam, therefore, is compelled to repress this stupid arrogance, by pleading God’s command, and declaring that nothing more was allowed him than to announce what God prescribed. But we must remember that this was only spoken in reference to a particular act, when, as far as his words went, he acted the part of a true prophet, although his feelings were altogether on the other side. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(159)</span> L’authorite de le faire parler comme il veudroit;” the authority to make him speak whatever he chose. —<em>Fr </em></p></div></div>
