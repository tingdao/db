<div class="comment-content"><p>It may now be asked, What was this drunkenness which the Prophet announces? It may be understood in two ways, — either that God would give them up to a reprobate mind, — or that he would make them drunk with evils and calamities; for when God deprives men of a right mind, it is to prepare them for extreme vengeance. But the Prophet seems to have something further in view — that this people would be given up to the most grievous evils, which would wholly fill them with amazement. Yet it appears from the context that the former evil is intended here; for he says, <em>I will dash them one against another, every one against his brother, even the fathers and sons together; </em>and thus they were all to be broken as it were in pieces. God then not only points out the calamity which was nigh the Jews, but also the manner of it; that is, that every one would draw his own brethren to ruin, as though they inflicted wounds on one another. But God says first generally, <em>I will fill all the inhabitants of the land with drunkenness, </em>and then he explains the effect, such as I have stated. </p><p>But he afterwards speaks of the whole people, including the <em>kings, priests, </em>and <em>prophets, </em>so that he excepts no order of men, however honorable; and this express mention of different orders was altogether necessary, for kings thought that they ought not to have been blended with the common people. The priests also regarded themselves as sacred, and a similar pride possessed the false prophets. But Jeremiah includes them all, without exception, in the same bundle, as though he had said, — “The majesty of kings shall not deliver them from God’s judgment, nor shall the priests be safe on account of their dignity, nor shall it avail the false prophets to boast of that noble and illustrious office which they discharge.” This prediction was no doubt regarded as very unjust; for we know with what high commendations God had spoken of the kingdom of David. As to the priesthood, we also know that it was a type of the priesthood of Christ, and also that the whole tribe of Levi was counted sacred to God. It could not therefore be but that Jeremiah must have greatly exasperated the minds of all by thus threatening kings as well as priests. </p><p>But we hence gather, — that there is nothing so high and so illustrious on earth, which ought not to be made to submit, when the power and glory of God, and the authority of celestial truth, are to be vindicated. Whatever then is precious and excellent in the world must come to nothing, if it derogates even in the least degree from the glory of God or from the authority of his truth: and yet kings and priests dared to oppose the word of God. No wonder then, that the Prophet should thrust them down from their elevations and compare them to bottles: he thus treads under foot that frail glory by which they sought to obscure God himself. And as the name of David was, as it were, sacred among that people, in order to shake off this vain confidence, the Prophet says, — “Though kings sit on the throne of David and be his successors and posterity, yet God will not spare them.” <span class="cite-ref">(77)</span> And hence also it appears how foolishly the Papal clergy at this day bring forward against us their privileges and their dignity. Doubtless, whatever these unprincipled men may claim for themselves, they cannot yet make themselves equal to the Levitical priests: and yet we see that it availed them nothing, that God had set them apart for himself, because they had abused their power. There is, therefore, no reason for the Pope and his clergy, the very filth of the world, to be at this day so proud. We now perceive the design of the words, when mention is made of kings, priests, and prophets. </p><p>It must, however, be observed, that, he does not speak here of faithful prophets, but of those who wore the mask, while yet they brought nothing but chaff instead of wheat, as we shall hereafter see. He then uses the word prophets in an improper sense, for he applies it to false teachers, as we do at this day, when we speak of those savages who boast that they are bishops and prelates and governors: we indeed concede to them these titles, but it does not follow that they justly deserve to be counted bishops, though they are so called. In the same way then does Jeremiah speak here of those who were called prophets, who yet were wholly unworthy of the office. </p><p>He then speaks of the collision to which we have referred, — I will cause them to <em>tear </em>or break <em>one another </em>in pieces. Some render the word “scatter;” but scattering does by no means comport with the words, <em>every one, against his brother, </em>etc. <span class="cite-ref">(78)</span> We hence see that the meaning is much more suitable when we render the words, I <em>will dash them, every one against his brother, </em>and then, <em>even the fathers and the sons together; </em>so that they might tear one another by a mutual conflict. And hence, as I have said, Jeremiah not only foretells the destruction of the people, but also points out the manner of it; for they would become so void of common prudence, that they would willfully destroy one another, as though they were given up to mutual slaughter. They gloried, we know, in their number, but the Prophet shews that this would be no protection to them, but, on the contrary, the cause of their ruin; for the Lord would so blind them, that they would fight with one another, and thus perish without any foreign enemy. </p><p>He then adds, <em>I will not spare, I will not spare, </em><span class="cite-ref">(79)</span><em>I will not have mercy </em>He repeats three times that he would not be propitious to them. It would have been sufficient to declare this once, were they so teachable and attentive as really to consider the threatenings announced to them; but being so torpid as they were, it was necessary to repeat the same thing often; not as though there was anything ambiguous or obscure in the message itself, but because hardly any vehemence was sufficient to rouse hearts so obstinate. We hence see why the Prophet repeated the same thing so often. He, however, does not employ words uselessly: whenever God repeats the promises of his favor, he does not utter words heedlessly and without reason; but since he sees that there is in us so much dulness, that one promise is not sufficient, he confirms it by repetitions; so also when he sees that men, owing to their stupidity, cannot be moved nor terrified by his threatenings, he repeats them, that they may have more weight. He in short declares, that it was all over with that people, so that he does not now call the wicked and the rebellious to repentance, but speaks to them as to men past remedy. This is the meaning. </p><p>And he adds, <em>Until I shall consume them </em><span class="cite-ref">(80)</span> This refers to the whole body of the people. God, in the meantime, still preserved, in a wonderful manner and by hidden means, a remnant, as it has appeared elsewhere: but yet God took that vengeance, which is here denounced on the people as a body; for it was as it were a general death, when they were all driven into exile and everywhere scattered. Now as the Lord in so great a ruin never forgot his covenant, but some seed still remained safe and secure; so what is said here, <em>I will not have mercy until I shall consume them, </em>is not inconsistent with the promise of mercy elsewhere given, when he declares that he is long-suffering and plenteous in mercy. (<span class="bvs">Num_14:18</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_103:8</span>) Though God then destroyed his people in so dreadful a manner, yet he did not divest himself of his own nature, nor cast away his mercy; but he executed his judgments on the reprobate in a way so wonderful, that he yet lost nothing of his eternal mercy and remained still faithful as to his election. It follows — </p><p><strong>(77)</strong> The clause, literally rendered, would convey this meaning, — </p><p>And the kings who sit for David on his throne. </p><p>“For David,” that is, as his representatives. “In David’s stead,” is the rendering of <em>Gataker </em>and <em>Blayney. </em>The word “even” before “the kings” in our version, is improper; for what follows is not a specification of what is gone before, as “the inhabitants of Jerusalem,” at the end of the verse, is in contrast with “all the inhabitants of this land,” that is, the people of the country — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(78)</strong> The word seems to mean shattering or breaking in pieces, and in a secondary sense, scattering, as the effect. The early versions give the latter meaning, scattering, but, as <em>Calvin </em>says, inconsistently with the rest of the clause. The <em>Targum </em>gives in effect the first sense, “I will cause them to rush, each on his brother.” The word “dash” is the most suitable, or dash to pieces, — </p><p>And I will dash them to pieces, each against his brother, <LineBreak />Both the fathers and the sons together, saith Jehovah. </p><p>The allusion is to the bottles: they would be broken like brittle vessels, when thrown one against another. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(79)</strong> The verbs are different, and so <em>Calvin </em>renders them in the text; but not here. There is no unanimity in the versions as to these verbs and the one which follows. The first means to be tender so as to relent; the second, to spare so as not to inflict punishment, to connive; and the third, to feel pity or compassion. They may be rendered thus, — </p><p>I will not relent, nor will I spare; <LineBreak />Nor will I pity, so as not to destroy them. </p><p>The two lines announce the same thing, only the last is stronger and more specific. Pitying or commiserating is stronger than relenting, and not destroying describes the act, while sparing is a general term. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(80)</strong> The sentence literally is, “From consuming,” or destroying, “them.” The preposition <span class="lang he-il">מ</span><em>, mem, </em>here has the force of a negative. It is a sort of an elliptic phrase, which, though understood in the original, yet requires a supplement in a translation, — “I will not pity, <em>so as to abstain </em>from consuming them.” But a literal rendering in Welsh would be understood, — </p><p>(lang. cy) Ae ni resynav rhag eu difetha. </p><p>The preposition <em>“ </em>(lang. cy) <em>rhag </em><em>,” </em>which ordinarily means <em>from</em>, signifies here <em>from not, </em>which is exactly the Hebrew. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
