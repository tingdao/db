<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Let your light shine before men </em>After having taught the apostles that, in consequence of the rank in which they are placed, both their vices and their virtues are better known for a good or bad example, he now enjoins them so to regulate their life, as to excite all to glorify God. <em>That they may see your good works: </em>for, as Paul tells us, believers must, </p><p>“provide for honest things, not only in the sight of God, <LineBreak />but also in the sight of men,” (<span class="bvs">2Co_8:21</span>.) </p><p>The command, which he gives shortly afterwards, to seek concealment and a retired situation for their good works, (<span class="bvs">Mat_6:4</span>,) is intended only to forbid ostentation. In the present instance, he has quite a different object in view, to recommend to them the glory of God alone. Now, if the glory of good works cannot be properly ascribed to God, unless they are traced to him, and unless he is acknowledged to be their only Author, it is evident, that we cannot, without offering an open and gross insult to God, extol free will, as if good works proceeded wholly, or in part, from its power. Again, we must observe, how graciously God deals with us, when he calls the good works <em>ours, </em>the entire praise of which would justly be ascribed to himself. </p></div>
