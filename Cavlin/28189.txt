<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong>We here see with what solicitude the holy man obviated offenses; for in order to soften whatever sharpness there may have been in his manner of explaining the rejection of the Jews, he still testifies, as before, his goodwill towards them, and proves it by the effect; for their salvation was an object of concern to him before the Lord, and such a feeling arises only from genuine love. It may be at the same time that he was also induced by another reason to testify his love towards the nation from which he had sprung; for his doctrine would have never been received by the Jews had they thought that he was avowedly inimical to them; and his defection would have been also suspected by the Gentiles, for they would have thought, as we have said in the last chapter, that he became an apostate from the law through his hatred of men. <span class="cite-ref">(319)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(319)</span> [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] <em>’s </em>Latin for this verse is: “Fratres, benevolentia certe cordis mei et deprecatio ad Deum super Israel est in salutem — Brethren, the goodwill indeed of my heart and prayer to God for Israel is for <em>their </em>salvation.” The word for “goodwill<span class="lang el-gr">,” εὐδοκία, </span> means a kind disposition towards another, it means here a benevolent or a sincere desire, or, according to [<span class="bvs">Theophylact </span>], an earnest desire.
