<div class="comment-content"><p>He first asks God to <em>persecute them in wrath, </em>that is, to be implacable to them; for persecution is, when God not only chastises the wicked for a short time, but when he adds evils to evils, and accumulates them until they perish. He then adds, and prays God to <em>destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah </em>This phrase is emphatical; and they extenuate the weightiness of the sentence, who thus render it, “that God himself would destroy the ungodly from the earth.” For the Prophet does not without a design mention the heavens of Jehovah, as though he had said, that though God is hidden from us while we sojourn in the world, he yet dwells in heaven, for heaven is often called the throne of God, — </p><p>“The heaven is my throne.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_66:1</span>.) </p><p>“O God, who dwellest in the sanctuary.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_22:4</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_77:14</span>.) </p><p>By God’s sanctuary is often meant heaven. For this reason, then, the Prophet asked here that the ungodly should be destroyed from under the <em>heaven of Jehovah, </em>that is, that their destruction might testify that he sits in heaven, and is the judge of the world, and that things are not in such a confusion, but that the ungodly must at length render an account before the celestial judge, whom they have yet long neglected. This is the end of the chapter. </p></div>
