<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>The Lord will not spare him</em>. Moses here teaches us that the obstinacy in which the wicked are willfully hardened, shuts against them the door of hope, so that they will find that God is not to be appeased. And assuredly it is the climax of all sins that a wretched man, who is abandoned to vice, should extinguish the light of his own reason, and destroy the image of God within him, so as to degenerate into a beast: and not only so, but also that he should dethrone God, as if He were not the Judge of the world. And this is the insult which they put upon Him who abandon themselves to sin in the confident expectation of impunity. <span class="cite-ref">(273)</span> Thus, by Isaiah, God swears that this was an inexpiable crime, that, when He called them to baldness and to mourning, the Israelites encouraged each other to gladness; and, whilst feasting luxuriously, said in ridicule, “Tomorrow we shall die.” ( <span class="bvs">Isa_22:12</span>.) By the word, <span class="lang he-il">אבה</span>, <em>ahab</em>, Moses altogether shuts out the grace of God. <span class="cite-ref">(274)</span> Meanwhile he contrasts God’s fixed purpose, — that He will not be willing to pardon, — with the depraved pleasures of those who take too much delight in their sins. Behold, then, what poor sinners gain by their proud contempt when they endeavor to cast off God’s judgment together with His fear! </p><p>Further, in order the better to express that God will be irreconcilable to such great perversity, he declares that He will exterminate from the earth those who have so wantonly exulted in iniquity; and finally adds, that He will give them up to be accursed (<em>in anathemata</em>,) so that they shall no longer hold a place among the people of Israel. Now, it is a much more grievous thing to be cut off from the elect people, and to be set apart unto evil, as it is here said, than to be deprived of natural life. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(273)</span> “Car ceux qui sous ombre d’eschapper son jugement s’abandonnent ‘a pecher, luy font ce dishonneur de le despouiller de son empire;” for those who abandon themselves to sin under cover of escaping His judgment, do him this dishonor of despoiling him of his empire. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(274)</span> “Le verbe que nous avons translate <em>condescendre</em>, signifie venir a gre. Ainsi Moyse exclud toutes graces de Dieu;” the verb which we have translated <em>condescend</em>, (the Lord will not <em>condescend </em>to spare him,) signifies to consent. Thus Moses shuts out all the graces of God. — <em>Fr </em><span class="lang he-il">יאבה</span>, <em>acquiescet</em>. — Taylor. </p></div></div>
