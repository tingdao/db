<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>67.</strong><em>Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost </em>We have lately explained this phrase to mean, that the servants of God received more abundantly the grace of the Spirit, of which, at other times, they were not destitute. Thus we read, that the Spirit was given to the prophets: not that on other occasions they wanted it, but that the power of the Spirit was more fully exerted in them, when the hand of God, as it were, brought them into public view, for the discharge of their office. We must observe, therefore, the manner in which Luke connects the two clauses: he <em>was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied </em>This implies that divine inspiration, at that time, rested upon him in an extraordinary measure, in consequence of which he did not speak like a man or private person, but all that he uttered was heavenly instruction. Thus also Paul connects prophecy with the Spirit. </p><p>“Quench not the Spirit: despise not prophesyings,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Th_5:19</span>.) </p><p>which teaches us that to despise instruction is to <em>“quench” </em>the light of “the Spirit.” This was a remarkable instance of the goodness of God, that not only did Zacharias recover the power of speech, which he had not enjoyed for nine months, but his tongue became the organ of the Holy Spirit. </p></div>
