<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>They passing through the valley of weeping, will together make it a well. </em>The meaning of the Psalmist is, that no impediments can prevent the enlightened and courageous worshippers of God from making conscience of waiting upon the sanctuary. By this manner of speaking, he confirms the statement which he had previously made, That nothing is more desirable than to be daily engaged in the worship of God; showing, as he does, that no difficulties can put a stop to the ardent longings of the godly, and prevent them from hastening with alacrity, yea, even though their way should be through dry and barren deserts, to meet together to solemnise the holy assemblies. As the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">הבחא</span>, <em>habbacha, </em>when the final letter is <span class="lang he-il">ה</span>, <em>he, </em>signifies <em>tears, </em>and when the final letter is <span class="lang he-il">א</span><em>, aleph, a mulberry tree, </em>some here read <em>valley of tears, </em>and others, <em>valley of the mulberry. </em>The majority of interpreters adopt the first reading; but the other opinion is not destitute of probability. <span class="cite-ref">(465)</span> There is, however, no doubt, that dry and barren deserts are here to be understood, in travelling through which, much difficulty and privation must be endured, particularly from the want of water; drink being of all other articles the most necessary to persons when travelling. David intended this as an argument to prove the steadfastness of the godly, whom the scarcity of water, which often discourages travelers from prosecuting their journey, will not hinder from hastening to seek God, though their way should be through sandy and and vales. In these words, reproof is administered to the slothfulness of those who will not submit to any inconvenience for the sake of being benefited by the service of God. They indulge themselves in their own ease and pleasures, and allow nothing to interfere with these. They will, therefore, provided they are not required to make any exertion or sacrifice, readily profess themselves to be the servants of God; but they would not give a hair of their head, or make the smallest sacrifice, to obtain the liberty of hearing the gospel preached, and of enjoying the sacraments. This slothful spirit, as is evident from daily observation, keeps multitudes fast bound to their nests, so that they cannot bear to forego in any degree their own ease and convenience. Yea, even in those places where they are summoned by the sound of the church-bell to public prayers <span class="cite-ref">(466)</span> to hear the doctrine of salvation, or to partake of the holy mysteries, we see that some give themselves to sleep, some think only of gain, some are entangled with the affairs of the world, and others are engaged in their amusements. It is therefore not surprising, if those who live at a distance, and who cannot enjoy these religious services and means of salvation, without making some sacrifice of their worldly substance, remain lolling at home. That such may not live secure and self-satisfied in the enjoyment of outward prosperity, David declares, that those who have true heart religion, and who sincerely serve God, direct their steps to the sanctuary of God, not only when the way is easy and cheerful, under the shade and through delightful paths, but also when they must walk through rugged and barren deserts; and that they will rather make for themselves cisterns with immense toil, than be prevented from prosecuting their journey by reason of the drought of the country. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(465)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ou la cloche sonnera pour appeler les gens aux prieres publiques</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(466)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il dit que les fideles y viendront a grand foulle, et a l’envie l’un de l’autre, comme on dit</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
