<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>He that is wounded. </em>What is here delivered respecting those who are mutilated, and who are bastards, has a similar object; lest the Church of God should be onctaminate by foul stains, and thus religion should lose its honor. Moses rejects from the congregation of the faithful two sorts of men, viz, eunuchs and bastards. But, before we treat of the subject itself, the definition of the words is to be considered. The first question is, that it is to enter into the congregation; the second, what it is to be wounded in the stones; the third, who are the <span class="lang he-il">ממזרים</span>, <em>mamzerim</em>, which we have translated bastards, (<em>spurios </em>). Many understand that both are rejected from the church, lest they should undertake any public office in it; others, lest they should marry wives of the seed of Abraham; because it would not be fair that women should be thrown away upon bastards, (<em>Lat, </em><em>mamzeris </em><em>;</em>) and it would be absurd that those who were created to multiply God’s people, should marry impotent persons, (<em>effoeminatis </em>). But both these opinions appear to me to be tame. For what is afterwards added respecting certain foreign nations cannot be so taken, that no government or dignity should be entrusted to them; besides, by “the congregation of the Lord,” the purity and holiness of religion is sufficiently expressed. I do not doubt, then, but that Moses prohibits those who are defiled by these two stains from communicating in the sacrifices. For although they were circumcised as well as the rest of the chosen people, still God would have them bear this mark of their disgrace, that they might be an example to others, and that the people might be more diligent in preserving themselves from all pollution. This, then, is to be concluded that the privilege which was peculiar to the legitimate Israelites, was to be denied them of being participators and associates <span class="cite-ref">(19)</span> in the sacrifices. As to the wounded testicles, the Jews dispute more curiously, in my opinion, that the subject warrants, and after all miss the right meaning. For God intended nothing else than to exclude from the congregation of His people, wherever holy assemblies were held, those who were mutilated or defective in the genital organs; although by <em>synecdoche, </em>He comprehends more than are specified. Finally, by condemning this external bodily defect He commends the excellency of His people that they may remember themselves to be His chosen property, not that they should pride themselves upon it <span class="cite-ref">(20)</span> but that the holiness of their life may correspond with such high nobility. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(19)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et d’entrer au parvis pour faire service solennel a Dieu</span>;” and to enter into the court to perform solemn service to God — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(20)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais afin de se maintenir en sa grace par sainetete de vie</span>;” but that they might keep themselves in His favor by holiness of life—<em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
