<div class="comment-content"><p>We just saw that there were many reprobate in that small number. Hence, therefore, it is easily gathered how desperate was the impiety of the whole people. <em>After this, he </em>says, <em>take: </em>this adverb is used that those who survived after the slaughter of the city should not think that all their punishments were over: <em>after this, </em>says he, that is, when they shall fancy all their difficulties over, <em>thou shalt take from that part which thou hast preserved, and shalt cast it into the fire. Thence, </em>he says, a<em>fire shall go forth through the whole house of Israel </em>He signifies by these words, as we have seen before, that the vision was not illusory, just as many fictitious things are represented in a theater. Hence God says, what he shows by vision to his servant would happen, as the event itself at length proved. But he goes further <em>that the whole house of Israel shall burn in this burning, </em>because indeed the last destruction of the city brought despair to the miserable, exiles, who, while the city was standing, promised themselves a return. But when they saw such utter destruction of the city, they were consumed just as if fire from Judea had crept even to themselves. In the meantime the remnant are always excepted whom the Lord wonderfully preserved, although he was in a vision destroying the whole people. We now see the tendency of this vision. I will not proceed further, because I should be compelled to desist, and so the doctrine would be abrupt. It is sufficient therefore to hold, although the people was divided into many parts so that the condition of each was distinct, yet that all should perish, since God so determined. Hence the confidence of those who thought they would be safe at Jerusalem was broken: then the ten tribes, which were captives, ought also to acknowledge that the last vengeance of God was not <em>complete, </em>until the city itself, the seat of government and the priesthood was destroyed. </p></div>
