<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>All things are of God. </em>He means, all things that belong to Christ’s kingdom. “If we would be Christ’s, we must be regenerated by God. Now that is no ordinary gift.” He does not, therefore, speak here of creation generally; but of the grace of regeneration, which God confers peculiarly upon his elect, and he affirms that it is <em>of God </em>— not on the ground of his being the Creator and Artificer of heaven and earth, but inasmuch as he is the new Creator of the Church, by fashioning his people anew, according to his own image. Thus all flesh is abased, and believers are admonished that they must now live to God, inasmuch as they are a <em>new creature. </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_5:17</span>.) This they cannot do, unless they forget the world, as they are also no longer <em>of the world, </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_17:16</span>,) because they are <em>of God </em></p><p><em>Who hath reconciled us </em>Here there are <em>two </em>leading points — the <em>one </em>relating to the reconciliation of men with God; and the <em>other, </em>to the way in which we may enjoy the benefit of this reconciliation. Now these things correspond admirably with what goes before, for as the Apostle had given the preference to a good conscience above every kind of distinction, (<span class="bvs">2Co_5:11</span>,) he now shows that the whole of the gospel tends to this. He shows, however, at the same time, the dignity of the Apostolical office, that the Corinthians may be instructed as to what they ought to seek in him, whereas they could not distinguish between true and false ministers, for this reason, that nothing but show delighted them. Accordingly, by making mention of this, he stirs them up to make greater proficiency in the doctrine of the gospel. For an absurd admiration of profane persons, who serve their own ambition rather than Christ, originates in our not knowing, what the office of the preaching of the gospel includes, or imports. </p><p>I now return to those <em>two leading points </em>that are here touched upon. The first is — that God <em>hath reconciled us to himself by Christ </em>This is immediately followed by the declaration — <em>Because God was in Christ, </em>and has in his person accomplished reconciliation. The manner is subjoined — <em>By not imputing unto men their trespasses </em>Again, there is annexed a <em>second </em>declaration — <em>Because Christ having been made a sin-offering for our sins, has procured righteousness for us. </em>The <em>second </em>part of the statement is — that the grace of reconciliation is applied to us by the gospel, that we may become partakers of it. Here we have a remarkable passage, if there be any such in any part of Paul’s writings. Hence it is proper, that we should carefully examine the words one by one. </p><p><em>The ministry of reconciliation </em>Here we have an illustrious designation of the gospel, as being an embassy for reconciling men to God. It is also a singular dignity of ministers — that they are sent to us by God with this commission, so as to be messengers, and in a manner sureties. <span class="cite-ref">(553)</span> This, however, is not said so much for the purpose of commending ministers, as with a view to the consolation of the pious, that as often as they hear the gospel, they may know that God treats with them, and, as it were, stipulates with them as to a return to his grace. Than this blessing what could be more desirable? Let us therefore bear in mind, that this is the main design of the gospel — that whereas we are <em>by nature children of wrath, </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_2:3</span>,) we may, by the breaking up of the quarrel between God and us, be received by him into favor. Ministers are furnished with this commission, that they may bring us intelligence of so great a benefit, nay more, may assure us of God’s fatherly love towards us. Any other person, it is true, might also be a witness to us of the grace of God, but Paul teaches, that this office is specially intrusted to ministers. When, therefore, a duly ordained minister proclaims in the gospel, that God has been made propitious to us, he is to be listened to just as an ambassador of God, and sustaining, as they speak, a public character, and furnished with rightful authority for assuring us of this. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(553)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et comme pleges de sa bonne volonte enuers nous</span>;” — “And as it were pledges of his good will toward us.” </p></div></div>
