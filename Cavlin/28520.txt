<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>He that is married careth for the things of the world</em>. By <em>the things of the world </em>you must understand the things that belong to the present life; for the world is taken here to mean the condition of this earthly life. But from this someone will infer, that all, therefore, who are married are strangers to the kingdom of God, <span class="cite-ref">(432)</span> as thinking of nothing but this earth. I answer, that the Apostle speaks only of a portion of the thoughts, as though he had said: “They have one eye directed to the Lord, but in such a way as to have the other directed to their wife; for marriage is like a burden, by which the mind of a pious man is weighed down, so that he does not move God-ward with so much alacrity.” Let us always, however, bear in mind, that these evils do not belong to marriage, but proceed from the depravity of men. Hence the calumnies of Jerome, <span class="cite-ref">(433)</span> who scrapes together all these things for the purpose of bringing marriages into disrepute, fall. For, were any one to condemn agriculture, merchandise, and other modes of life, on this ground, that amidst so many corruption’s of the world, there is not one of them that is exempt from certain evils, who is there that would not smile at his folly? Observe, then, that whatever evil there is in marriage, has its origin somewhere else; for at this day a man would not have been turned away from the Lord by the society of his wife, if he had remained in a state of innocence, and had not corrupted the holy institution of God; but a wife would have been a <em>help-meet to </em>him in everything good, as she was created for that end. (<span class="bvs">Gen_2:18</span>.) </p><p>But some one will say: “If anxieties that are faulty and blameworthy are invariably connected with marriage, how is it possible for married persons to call upon God, and serve him, with a pure conscience?” I answer, that there are <em>three </em>kinds of anxieties. There are some that are evil and wicked in themselves, because they spring from distrust. Of these Christ speaks in <span class="bvs">Mat_6:25</span> : There are others that are necessary, and are not displeasing to God; as, for example, it becomes the father of a family to be concerned for his wife and children, and God does not mean that we should be mere stumps, so as to have no concern as to ourselves. The <em>third </em>class are a mixture of the two former; when we are anxious respecting those things as to which we ought to feel anxiety, but feel too keenly excited, in consequence of that excess which is natural to us. Such anxieties, therefore, are not by any means wrong in themselves, but they are corrupt, in consequence of <span class="lang el-gr">αταξια</span>, that is to say, undue excess. And the Apostle did not intend merely to condemn here those vices by which we contract guilt in the sight of God, but he desires in a general way, that we may be freed from all impediments, so as to be wholly at leisure for the service of God. </p><p><em>And is divided. </em>It is surprising how there has come to be so much diversity upon this passage. For the common Greek version is so widely different from the old Latin translation, that the diversity cannot be ascribed to mistake or inadvertence, in the way in which a mistake often happens in a single letter or a single word. Now the Greeks commonly read it literally, “He that is married thinks of the things of the world, how he may please his wife: a married woman and a virgin are divided: She that is unmarried, thinketh of the things of the Lord,” etc. And <em>being divided </em>they understand as meaning <em>to differ</em>, as if it had been said: “There is a great difference between a married woman and a virgin; for the one is at leisure to attend to the things of God exclusively, while the other is taken up with various matters.” But as this interpretation is somewhat at variance with the simple meaning of the word, I do not approve of it, especially as the meaning of the other reading (which is found also in some Greek manuscripts) is more suitable and less forced. We may, accordingly, understand it in this manner — that a man who is married is <em>divided</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(434)</span> inasmuch as he devotes himself partly to God and partly to his wife, and is not wholly and exclusively God’s. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(432)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Forclos du royaume de Dieu</span>;” — “Shut out from the kingdom of God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(433)</span> See <em>Harmony</em>, volume 2. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(434)</span> Kypke (in his <em>Observationes Sacrae</em>) renders the original word <span class="lang el-gr">μεμέπισται</span>, as Calvin <em>does </em>— <em>divided </em>or <em>perplexed</em>, and brings forward a passage from <em>Achilles Tatius</em>, in which <span class="lang el-gr">εμεμεριστο</span> is used in a similar sense. In the Syriac version, on the other hand, the rendering is as follows: <em>Discrimen autem est inter mulierem et virginem </em> — <em>There is a difference between a wife and a virgin </em>The Greek commentators interpret the clause thus: — <span class="lang el-gr">Μεμέρισται, τουτ ᾿ εστιν, διαφερουσιν αλληλων, και ου την αὐτην εχουσι φροντιδὰ</span> — <em>They differ from one another and have not the same care </em>Bloomfield considers <em>divided </em>or <em>distracted </em>to be a harsh interpretation, and not agreeable to the context, and renders the clause — “There is a difference between.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
