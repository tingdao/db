<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>56.</strong><em>Your father Abraham. </em>He grants to them, in words only, what he formerly took from them, that <em>Abraham is their father </em>But he shows how idle is the objection drawn from the name of <em>Abraham </em>“He had no other object,” says he, “during his whole life, than to see my kingdom flourish. He longed for me when I was absent, you despise me when I am present.” What Christ here asserts concerning Abraham alone, applies to all the saints. But this doctrine has greater weight in the person of Abraham, because he is the father of the whole Church. Whoever then desires to be reckoned in the number of the godly, let him rejoice, as he ought to do, in the presence of Christ, for which Abraham ardently longed. </p><p><em>Exulted to see my day. </em>The word <em>exult </em>expresses a vehement zeal <span class="cite-ref">(248)</span> and ardent affection. We must now supply the contrast. Though the knowledge of Christ was still so obscure, Abraham was inflamed by so strong a desire, that he preferred the enjoyment of it to everything that was reckoned desirable. How base then is the ingratitude of those who despise and reject him, when he is plainly offered to them? The word<em>day </em>does not, in this passage, denote eternity, (as Augustine thought,) but the time of Christ’s kingdom, when he appeared in the world clothed with flesh, to fulfill the office of Redeemer. </p><p>But a question now arises, How did Abraham behold, even with the eyes of faith, the manifestation of Christ? For this appears not to agree with another statement of Christ, </p><p>Many kings and prophets desired to see the things which you see, <LineBreak />and yet did not see them, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Luk_10:24</span>.) </p><p>I reply, faith has its degrees in beholding Christ. Thus the ancient prophets beheld Christ at a distance, as he had been promised to them, and yet were not permitted to behold him present, as he made himself familiarly and completely visible, when he came down from heaven to men. </p><p>Again, we are taught by these words that, as God did not disappoint the desire of <em>Abraham</em>, so he will not now permit any one to breathe after Christ, without obtaining some good fruit which shall correspond to his holy desire. The reason why he does not grant the enjoyment of himself to many is — the wickedness of men; for few desire him. <em>Abraham </em>’<em>s joy </em>testifies that he regarded the knowledge of the kingdom of Christ as an incomparable treasure; and the reason why we are told that he<em>rejoiced to see the day of Christ </em>is, that we may know that there was nothing which he valued more highly. But all believers receive this fruit from their faith, that, being satisfied with Christ alone, in whom they are fully and completely happy and blessed, their consciences are calm and cheerful. And indeed no man knows Christ aright, unless he gives him this honor of relying entirely upon him. </p><p>Others explain it to mean, that Abraham, being already dead, enjoyed the presence of Christ, when he appeared to the world; and so they make the time of <em>desiring </em>and the time of <em>seeing </em>to be different. And indeed it is true, that the coming of Christ was manifested to holy spirits after death, of which coming they were held in expectation during the whole of their life; but I do not know if so refined an exposition agrees with Christ’s words. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(248)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Un vehement zele</span>.” </p></div></div>
