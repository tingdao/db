<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>The works of Jehovah are great </em>He now proceeds to inform us that there are abundant materials for praising God, supplied by his works, to which at present he makes only a general reference, and which he, subsequently, defines more explicitly in relation to the government of the Church. The magnitude of God’s works is a subject which, generally, eludes the observation of men, and, therefore, few of them are acquainted with it. This ignorance the prophet ascribes to the indifference and ingratitude of men, comparatively few of whom condescend to notice the great wisdom, goodness, justice, and power, which shine forth in these works. Expositors are divided in their sentiments about the second clause of the verse. Some translate it, <em>sought out for all their delights; </em>and, indeed, the Hebrew term <span class="lang he-il">חפף</span>, <em>chaphets, </em>signifies <em>good pleasure; </em>but as this is too harsh an interpretation of the word, it is better to understand it as an adjective, expressing the idea of <em>loving </em>or <em>desiring. </em>As to the participle, <em>sought out, </em>which, according to the Hebrew verb, <span class="lang he-il">דרש</span>, <em>darash, </em>properly denotes, <em>to search with diligence, </em>we yet find that the works of Jehovah are, in this place, called <span class="lang he-il">דרושים</span>, <em>derushim, </em>that is, <em>perceived or found out. </em>Hence, in <span class="bvs">Isa_65:1</span>, it is said, “I was found of them who sought, me not.” I must, however, not lose sight of the prophet’s design, namely, that in consequence of so few applying themselves to the study of the works of God, he teaches us that that is the reason why so many are blind amidst a flood of light; for, when he says that the excellency of the works of God is known to all who desire it, he means that none are ignorant of it, except such as are wilfully blind, or rather, malignantly and contemptuously quench the light which is offered to them. We must, however, attend to the means which we possess for arriving at the knowledge of these words because we know, that as long as the faithful are on earth, their understandings are dull and weak, so that they cannot penetrate the mysteries, or comprehend the height of the works of God. But, incomprehensible as is the immensity of the wisdom, equity, justice, power, and mercy of God, in his works, the faithful nevertheless acquire as much knowledge of these as qualifies them for manifesting the glory of God; only it becomes us to begin the study of his works with reverence, that we may take delight in them, contemptible though they be in the estimation of the reprobate, who treat them with impious scorn. The LXX. having rendered it, <em>sought out in all his wills, </em>Augustine has therefore taken occasion, with philosophic finesse, to ask, How can there be, or, at least, appear to be, a plurality of wills in God? And it is indeed a pleasing consideration, that though God manifest his will in his law, nevertheless there is another secret purpose by which he is guided in the wonderful management of human affairs. This doctrine, however, is, foreign to the exposition of this passage. </p></div>
