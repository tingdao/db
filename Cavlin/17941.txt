<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>How art thou fallen from heaven! </em>Isaiah proceeds with the discourse which he had formerly begun as personating the dead, and concludes that the tyrant differs in no respect from other men, though his object was to lead men to believe that he was some god. He employs an elegant metaphor, by comparing him to <em>Lucifer</em>, and calls him the <em>Son of the Dawn</em>; <span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> and that on account of his splendor and brightness with which he shone above others. The exposition of this passage, which some have given, as if it referred to Satan, has arisen from ignorance; for the context plainly shows that these statements must be understood in reference to the king of the Babylonians. But when passages of Scripture are taken up at random, and no attention is paid to the context, we need not wonder that mistakes of this kind frequently arise. Yet it was an instance of very gross ignorance, to imagine that <em>Lucifer </em>was the king of devils, and that the Prophet gave him this name. But as these inventions have no probability whatever, let us pass by them as useless fables. </p><p><em>Casting the lot upon the nations, </em>or <em>weakening the nations. </em><span class="cite-ref">(221)</span> Translators have mistaken the meaning of this clause, by rendering the participle <span class="lang he-il">הולש</span> (<em>holesh</em>) passively, <em>Thou art become weak</em>, for its signification is active. But as the verb from which it is derived signifies <em>to cast a lot</em>, and as the preposition <span class="lang he-il">על</span>, (<em>gnal</em>,) <em>upon</em>, is here added, it is best to take it in this meaning, that, as the ruler and disposer of all countries, he directed them by lot, or held them as his own possessions. And yet I do not reject the other meaning, that he <em>weakened the nations </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(220)</span><em>Son of the morning</em>. — Eng.
