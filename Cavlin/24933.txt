<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>And Mary arising </em>This departure mentioned by Luke proves that Mary’s faith was not of a transitory nature: for the promise of God does not fade away with the presence of the angel, but is impressed upon her mind. The <em>haste </em>indicates a sincere and strong affection. We may infer from it that the Virgin disregarded every thing else and formed a just estimate of this grace of God. But it may be inquired, what was her object in undertaking this journey? It certainly was not made for the mere purpose of inquiry: for she cherished in her heart by faith the Son of God as already conceived in her womb. Nor do I agree with those who think that she came for the purpose of congratulating Elisabeth. <span class="cite-ref">(41)</span> I think it more probable that her object was, partly to increase and strengthen her faith, and partly to celebrate the grace of God which both had received. <span class="cite-ref">(42)</span></p><p>There is no absurdity in supposing, that she sought to confirm her faith by a view of the miracle, which had been adduced to her with no small effect by the angel. For, though believers are satisfied with the bare word of God, yet they do not disregard any of his works which they find to be conducive to strengthen their faith. Mary was particularly bound to receive the assistance which had been offered, unless she chose to reject what the Lord had freely given to her. Besides, the mutual interview might arouse both Elisabeth and herself to higher gratitude, as is evident from what follows. The power of God became more remarkable and striking by taking in at one view both favors, the very comparison of which gave no small additional luster. Luke does not name the city in which Zacharias dwelt, but only mentions that it belonged to the tribe of Judah, and that it was situated in a hilly district. Hence we infer that it was farther distant than Jerusalem was from the town of Nazareth. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(41)</span> “Gratulandi causa;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">pour faire caresse a sa cousine</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(42)</span> “Illustrandae ultro citroque gratiae Dei;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">de celebrer et magnifier la grace de Dieu faite a l'une et a l'autre</span>.” </p></div></div>
