<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>If we had been in the days of our fathers. </em>Not without good reason did Christ introduce this sentiment; for though he does not blame them for the conduct of their fathers, and does not make it the chief ground of accusation that they are the children of murderers: yet he takes a passing glance of their foolish boasting, in being accustomed to glory in their ancestors, while they were descended from the bloody enemies of God. The appeal may be thus stated: “You look upon the veneration which you pay to the deceased <em>prophets </em>as some sort of expiation for the wickedness of your <em>fathers. </em>Now then I have this to urge, that it is in vain for you to boast of a sacred ancestry, since you are descended from wicked and ungodly parents. Go now, and screen your crimes by the piety of those whose hands, you acknowledge, were stained with innocent blood. But it is an additional and far more heinous crime, that the sacrilegious fury of the <em>fathers, </em>which you condemn by raising sepulchers for the dead, is imitated by you in the murder of the living.” </p></div>
