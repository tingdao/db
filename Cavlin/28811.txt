<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>That the gift bestowed upon us through means of many persons. </em>As there is some difficulty in Paul’s words, interpreters differ as to the meaning. I shall not spend time in setting aside the interpretations of others, nor indeed is there any need for this, provided only we are satisfied as to the true and proper meaning. He had said, that the prayers of the Corinthians would be an assistance to him. He now adds a second advantage that would accrue from it — a higher manifestation of God’s glory. “For whatever God will confer upon me,” says he, “being as it were <em>obtained through means of many persons, </em>will, also, by <em>many </em>be celebrated with praises:<em>” </em>or in this way — “Many will give thanks to God in my behalf, because, in affording help to me, he has favorably regarded the prayers, not merely of one but of many.” In the first place, while it is our duty to allow no favor from God to pass without rendering praise, it becomes us, nevertheless, more especially when our prayers have been favorably regarded by him, to acknowledge his mercy with thanksgiving, as he commands us to do in <span class="bvs">Psa_50:15</span>. Nor ought this to be merely where our own personal interest is concerned, but also where the welfare of the Church in general, or that of any one of our brethren is involved. Hence when we mutually pray one for another, and obtain our desire, the glory of God is so much the more set forth, inasmuch as we all acknowledge, with thanksgiving, God’s benefits — both those that are conferred publicly upon the whole Church, and also those that are bestowed privately upon individuals. </p><p>In this interpretation there is nothing forced; for as to the circumstance that in the Greek the article being introduced between the two clauses <em>by many persons, </em>and the <em>gift conferred upon me </em>appears to disjoin them, <span class="cite-ref">(254)</span><em>that </em>has no force, as it is frequently found introduced between clauses that are connected with each other. Here, however, it is with propriety introduced in place of an adversative particle; <span class="cite-ref">(255)</span> for although it had come forth from many persons, it was nevertheless peculiar to Paul. To take the phrase <span class="lang el-gr">διὰ πολλῶν </span> (<em>by means of many</em>) in the neuter gender, <span class="cite-ref">(256)</span> as some do, is at variance with the connection of the passage. </p><p>It may, however, be asked, why he says <em>From many persons, </em>rather than <em>From many men, </em>and what is the meaning of the term <em>person </em>here? I answer, it is as though he had said — <em>With respect to many. </em>For the favor was conferred upon Paul in such a way, that it might be given to many. Hence, as God had respect to many, he says on that account, that many persons were the cause of it. Some Greek manuscripts have <span class="lang el-gr">ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν </span> — <em>on your account; </em>and although this appears to be at variance with Paul’s design, and the connection of the words, it may, nevertheless, be explained with propriety in this manner: “When God shall have heard you in behalf of my welfare, and that too for your own welfare, thanks will be given by many on your account.” </p><p><strong>(254)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car à suyure l’ordre du texte Grec il y auroit ainsi mot à mot, Afin que de plusieurs personnes, à nous le don conferé, par plusieurs soit recognu en action de graces pour nous</span>;” — “For, following the order of the Greek text, it would be literally thus: In order that from many persons the gift conferred upon us, may by many be acknowledged with thanksgiving on our account.” </p><p><strong>(255)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En lieu de quelque article aduersative qu’on appelle, comme Toutesfois ou Neantmoins</span>;” — “In place of some adversative particle, as it is called, as for example, Notwithstanding or Nevertheless.” </p><p><strong>(256)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De rapporter ce mot </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Par plusieurs</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, aux choses</span>;” — “To take this phrase, <em>By means of many</em>, as referring to <em>things</em>. ” </p></div>
