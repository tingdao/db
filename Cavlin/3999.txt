And, indeed, God Himself had appointed the New-moons (<em>Neomenias, vel novilunia</em>) and the other solemnities; but, lest any change should occur, since men are ever daring in their innovations, He would have their lawful observation sanctioned by the sound of the trumpets; as if, by the mouth of the priests, He Himself published the holy assemblies. The sacrifices, which others have translated “of your peace-offerings,” <span class="cite-ref">(78)</span> I translate, and not without reason, “of your prosperities.” For this is what <span class="lang he-il">שלמיכם</span>, <em>shalmecem, </em>properly means; and it was the name they gave to their supplications and testimonies of thanksgiving, when they had been delivered from some great danger, or were visited by some extraordinary blessing from God. But Moses says that the trumpets were to be “for a memorial before their God;” because when they should have assembled at His command, He would look upon them, and honor them with His paternal favor. </p><p><strong>(78)</strong> So <em>A.V </em><span class="lang he-il">שלמיכם</span>, <em>Pacificorum vestrorum </em><em>, </em>is the rendering of <em>SM. </em>To justify rendering this form of the word <em>your prosperities, </em>the vowel-points should be different. <em>Your sacrifices of thanksgiving, </em>is the ordinary interpretation of the lexicographers. — <em>W </em></p></div>
