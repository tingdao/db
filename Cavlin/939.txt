<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies </em><span class="cite-ref">(103)</span> Although this expression sounds harsh to Latin ears, the sense is not obscure. Jacob confesses, that greater mercies of God had been heaped upon him than he had dared to hope for: and therefore, far be it from him that he should plead anything of dignity or merit, for the purpose of obtaining what he asks. He therefore says, that he is less than God’s favors; because he felt himself to be unworthy of those excellent gifts which the Lord had so liberally bestowed upon him. Moreover, that the design of the holy patriarch may more clearly appear, the craft of Satan is to be observed: for, in order to deter us from praying, through a sense of our unworthiness, he would suggest to us this thought, “Who art thou that thou shouldst dare to enter into the presence of God?” Jacob early anticipates this objection, in declaring beforehand that he is unworthy of God’s former gifts, and at the same time acknowledges that God is not like men, in ever becoming weary to continue and increase his acts of kindness. Meanwhile, Jacob collects materials for confidence from the fact, that he has so often found God benignant towards him. Therefore, he had a double end in view; first, because he wished to counteract the distrust which might steal upon him in consequence of the magnitude of God’s gifts; and then, he turns those gifts to a different purpose, to assure himself that God would be the same to him that he had hitherto been. He uses two words, <em>mercies </em>and <em>truth</em>, to show that God is inclined by his mere goodness to benefit us; and in this way proves his own faithfulness. This combination of mercy with truth frequently occurs in the Scriptures, to teach us that all good things flow to us through the gratuitous favor of God; but that we are made capable of receiving them, when by faith we embrace his promises. </p><p><em>For with my staff </em><span class="cite-ref">(104)</span> Jacob does not enumerate separately the mercies of God, but under one species comprises the rest; namely, that whereas he had passed over Jordan, a poor and solitary traveler, he now returns rich, and replenished with abundance. The antithesis between a <em>staff </em>and <em>two troops </em>is to be noticed; in which he compares his former solitude and poverty with his present affluence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(103)</span>Minor sum cunctis misericordiis : “I am less than all the mercies.” — Margin of <em>English Translation</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(104)</span> That is, “poor, naked, and weak.” — <em>Rivet</em>. in Gen., p. 676. </p></div></div>
