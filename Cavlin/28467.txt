<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Put away that wicked person. </em>This is commonly explained as referring to the person who was guilty of an illicit connection with his mother-in-law. For as to those who understand the expression to mean — “Put away <em>evil </em>or <em>wickedness</em>, ” they are refuted by the Greek words made use of by Paul, the article (<span class="lang el-gr">τὸν</span>) being in the masculine gender, But what if you should view it as referring to the devil, who, undoubtedly in the person of a wicked and unprincipled man, <span class="cite-ref">(309)</span> is encouraged to establish his throne among us? For <span class="lang el-gr">ὁ πονηρος</span> (the wicked one) taken simply and without any addition, denotes the prince of all crimes, <span class="cite-ref">(310)</span> rather than some wicked man. If this meaning is approved of, Paul shows how important it is <span class="cite-ref">(311)</span> not to tolerate wicked persons, as by this means Satan is expelled from his kingdom which he keeps up among us, when indulgence is given to the wicked. <span class="cite-ref">(312)</span> If any one, however, prefers to understand it as referring to a <em>man</em>, I do not oppose it. Chrysostom compares the rigor of the law with the mildness of the gospel, inasmuch as Paul was satisfied with excommunication in case of an offense for which the law required the punishment of death, but for this there is no just ground. For Paul is not here addressing judges that are armed with the sword, but an unarmed multitude <span class="cite-ref">(313)</span> that was allowed merely to make use of brotherly correction. </p><p><strong>(309)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand on supporte un homme meschant et mal-vivant</span>;” — “When a wicked and unprincipled man is allowed to continue.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(310)</strong> It is well observed by Witsius in his Dissertations on the Lord’s Prayer, (Biblical Cabinet, No. 24,) that the appellation of <em>the evil One </em>is properly applied to Satan, “because he does nothing but what is evil — because all the evil that exists in the universe originated with him — because in doing evil, and in persuading others to do evil, he finds his only delight, the wicked and malignant solace of his desperate misery.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(311)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien il est utile et necessaire</span>;” — “How useful it is and necessary.” </p><p><strong>(312)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand il y a vne license de malfaire, et les meschans sont soufferts</span>;” — “When there is a license to do evil, and the wicked are tolerated.” </p><p><strong>(313)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Desnuee de puissance externe</span>;” — “Destitute of external power.” </p></div>
