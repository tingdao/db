<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>How long shall I take counsel in my soul? </em>We know that men in adversity give way to discontent, and look around them, first to one quarter, and then to another, in search of remedies. Especially, upon seeing that they are destitute of all resources, they torment themselves greatly, and are distracted by a multitude of thoughts; and in great dangers, anxiety and fear compel them to change their purposes from time to time, when they do not find any plan upon which they can fix with certainty. David, therefore, complains, that while thinking of different methods of obtaining relief, and deliberating with himself now in one way, and now in another, he is exhausted to no purpose with the multitude of suggestions which pass through his mind; and by joining to this complaint the <em>sorrow </em>which he felt daily, he points out the source of this disquietude. As in severe sickness the diseased would desire to change their place every moment, and the more acute the pains which afflict them are, the more fitful and eager are they in shifting and changing; so, when sorrow seizes upon the hearts of men, its miserable victims are violently agitated within, and they find it more tolerable to torment themselves without obtaining relief, than to endure their afflictions with composed and tranquil minds. The Lord, indeed, promises to give to the faithful “the spirit of counsels” (<span class="bvs">Isa_11:2</span>) but he does not always give it to them at the very beginning of any matter in which they are interested, but suffers them for a time to be embarrassed by long deliberation without coming to a determinate decision, <span class="cite-ref">(271)</span> or to be perplexed, as if they were entangled among thorns, not knowing whither to turn, <span class="cite-ref">(272)</span> or what course to take. Some explain the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">יומם</span>, <em>yomam, </em>as meaning <em>all the day long. </em>But it seems to me, that by it is rather meant another kind of continuance, namely, that his sorrow returned, and was renewed every day. In the end of the verse he deplores another evil, that his adversaries triumph over him the more boldly, when they see him wholly enfeebled, and as it were wasted by continual languor. Now this is an argument of great weight in our prayers; for there is nothing which is more displeasing to God, and which he will less bear with, than the cruel insolence which our enemies display, when they not only feast themselves by beholding us in misery, but also rise up the higher against us, and treat us the more disdainfully, the more they see us oppressed and afflicted. </p><p><strong>(271)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais permet que pour un temps ils s’entortillent en de longs discours sans venir au poinct</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(272)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne sachans on se tourner</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p></div>
