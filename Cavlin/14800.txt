<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>I will intrust his strength to thee </em>The obscurity of this passage has led to a variety of opinions amongst commentators. The most forced interpretation which has been proposed is that which supposes a change of person in the relative <em>his, </em>as if David, in speaking of himself, employed the third person instead of the first, <em>I will intrust my strength to thee </em>The Septuagint, and those who adopt this interpretation, have probably been led to it by the insufficient reason, that in the last verse of the psalm it is said, <em>I will ascribe with praises </em>my <em>strength to thee, </em>or, my <em>strength is with thee, I will sing, etc. </em>But on coming to that part of the psalm, we will have occasion to see that David there, with propriety, asserts of himself what he here in another sense asserts of Saul. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the relative is to be here understood of Saul. Some consider that the first words of the sentence should be read apart from the others — <em>strength is his </em>— meaning that Saul had the evident superiority in strength, so as at the present to be triumphant. Others join the two parts of the sentence, and give this explanation: Although thou art for the present moment his strength, in so far as thou dost sustain and preserve him on the throne, yet I will continue to hope, until thou hast raised me to the kingdom, according to thy promise. But those seem to come nearest the meaning of the Psalmist who construe the words as one continuous sentence — <em>I will put in trust his strength with thee; </em>meaning that, however intemperately Saul might boast of his strength, he would rest satisfied in the assurance that there was a secret divine providence restraining his actions. We must learn to view all men as subordinated in this manner, and to conceive of their strength and their enterprises as depending upon the sovereign will of God. In my opinion, the following version is the best — <em>His strength is with thee, </em><span class="cite-ref">(365)</span><em>I will wait. </em>The words are parallel with those in the end of the psalm, where there can be no doubt that the nominative case is employed, <em>My strength is with thee; I will sing. </em>So far as the sense of the passage is concerned, however, it does not signify which of the latter interpretations be followed. It is evident that David is here enabled, from the eminence of faith, to despise the violent opposition of his enemy, convinced that he could do nothing without the divine permission. But by taking the two parts of the sentence separately, in the way I have suggested, — <em>His strength is with thee, I will wait, </em>— the meaning is more distinctly brought out. First, David, in vindication of that power by which God governs the whole world, declares that his enemy was under a secret divine restraint, and so entirely dependent for any strength which he possessed upon God, that he could not move a finger without his consent. He then adds, that he would wait the event, whatsoever it might be, with composure and tranquillity. For the word which we have translated, <em>I will intrust, </em>may here be taken as signifying <em>I will keep myself, </em>or quietly wait the pleasure of the Lord. In this sense we find the word used in the conjugation <em>Niphal, </em><span class="bvs">Isa_7:4</span>. Here it is put in the conjugation <em>Kal, </em>but that is no reason why we may not render it, “I will silently wait the issue which God may send.” It has been well suggested, that David may allude to the guards which had been sent to besiege his house, and be considered as opposing to this a watch of a very different description, which he himself maintained, as he looked out for the divine issue with quietness and composure. <span class="cite-ref">(366)</span></p><p><strong>(365)</strong> In the Latin edition, from which we now translate, it reads, “Fortitude <em>mea </em>ad re.” This is evidently a mistake of the printer for “<em>fortitudo ejus </em>,” and has misled the former English translators. This is the more wonderful, as they thus make the Author adopt the very transposition of person which he had immediately before rejected. Of course, the French version reads, “<em class="lang fr-fr">Sa </em><span class="lang fr-fr">forte est a toy: je garderay</span>.” </p><p><strong>(366)</strong> Hammond translates, “His strength I will ward, or avoid, or beware, or take heed of at thee.” And the amount of his explanation is: Saul having sent a party to guard, that is, to besiege the house in which David was, in order to kill him, as is mentioned in the title of the psalm, David resolves to guard, or look to, or beware of the strength of his persecutor, by fleeing to God as his refuge. </p></div>
