We need not wonder that men unaccustomed to the doctrine of Christ are carried away by immoderate zeal, when it is not called for. Yet what they unwisely attempted to do, was made by Christ to promote his own glory; for not only was the miracle made known, but the whole of that district, in despising the Author of heavenly gifts, was rendered inexcusable. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(424)</span> Harmony, vol. 1. p. 374. </p></div></div>
