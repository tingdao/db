<div class="comment-content"><p>It is, indeed, an abrupt phrase when he says, Good and he will wait; for these words are without a subject; but as it is a general statement, there is no ambiguity. The Prophet means that it is <em>good to hope and to be silent as to the salvation, of God. </em>Then the verbs in the future tense ought to be rendered its subjunctives, as though it was said, “It is good when any one hopes in the salvation of Jehovah, and is silent, that is, bears patiently all his troubles until God succors him.” <span class="cite-ref">(185)</span></p><p>But; the Prophet here reminds us, that we are by no means to require that God should always appear to us, and that his paternal favor should always shine forth on our life. This is, indeed, a condition sought for by all; for the flesh inclines us to this, and hence we shun adversities. We, then, naturally desire God’s favor to be manifested to us; how? In reality, so that all things may go on prosperously, that no trouble may touch us, that we may be tormented by no anxiety, that no danger may be suspended over us, that no calamity may threaten us: these things, as I have said, we all naturally seek and desire. But in such a case faith would be extinguished, as Paul tells us in his Epistle to the Romans, </p><p>“For we hope not,” he says, “for what appears, but we hope for what, is hidden.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_8:24</span>.) </p><p>It is necessary in this world that the faithful should, as to outward things, be miserable, at one time exposed to want, at another subject to various dangers — at; one time exposed to reproaches and calumnies, at another harassed by losses: why so? because there would be no occasion for exercising hope, were our salvation complete. This is the very thing which the Prophet now teaches us, when he declares that it is good for us to learn in silence to wait for the salvation of God. </p><p>But to express more clearly his mind, he first says, He will wait, or hope. He teaches the need of patience, as also the Apostle does, in <span class="bvs">Heb_10:36</span>; for otherwise there can be no faith. It hence appears, that where there is no patience, there is not even a spark of faith in the heart of man; how so? because this is our happiness, to wait or to hope; and we hope for what is hidden. But in the second clause he explains himself still more clearly by saying, and <em>will be silent </em>To be silent means often in Scripture to rest, to be still; and here it signifies no other thing than to bear the troubles allotted to us, with a calm and resigned mind. He is then said to be silent to God, who remains quiet even when afflictions supply occasion for clamoring; and hence this quietness is opposed to violent feelings; for when some trouble presses on us, we become turbulent, and are carried away by our fury, at one time we quarrel with God, at another we pour forth various complaints. The same thing also happens, when we see some danger, for we tremble, and then we seek remedies here and there, and that with great eagerness. But he who patiently bears his troubles, or who recumbs on God when dangers surround him, is said to be silent or to rest quietly; and hence the words of Isaiah, “In hope and silence;” for he there exhorts the faithful to patience, and shews where strength is, even when we trust in God, so as willingly to submit to His will, and to be ready to bear his chastisements, and then when we doubt not but that he will be ready to bring us help when we are in danger. (<span class="bvs">Isa_30:15</span>.) </p><p>We now perceive what the Prophet means when he says, that it. is <em>good if we wait and be silent as to the salvation of God; </em>even because our happiness is hid, and we are also like the dead, as Paul says, and our life is hid in Christ. (<span class="bvs">Col_3:3</span>.) As then it is so, we must necessarily be silent as to God’s salvation, and cherish hope within, though surrounded with many miseries. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(185)</strong> It may be thus rendered, — </p><p>Good <em>it is </em>when he hopes and waits quietly <LineBreak />For the salvation of Jehovah. </p><p>The <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> may often be rendered when. This verse, the preceding, and following, begin with “good,” which renders the passage very striking, — </p><p>  </p><p><strong>25.</strong>Good is Jehovah to him who waits for him, <LineBreak />To the soul who seeks him: </p><p><strong>26.</strong>Good it is when he hopes and waits quietly <LineBreak />For the salvation of Jehovah: </p><p><strong>27.</strong>Good it is for man <LineBreak />That he bears the yoke in his youth. </p><p>— <em>Ed </em></p></div>
