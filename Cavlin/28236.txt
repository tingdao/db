<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>And, this is my covenant with them, etc. </em>Though Paul, by the last prophecy of Isaiah, briefly touched on the office of the Messiah, in order to remind the Jews what was to be expected especially from him, he further adds these few words from Jeremiah, expressly for the same purpose; for what is added is not found in the former passage. <span class="cite-ref">(365)</span> This also tends to confirm the subject in hand; for what he said of the conversion of a people who were so stubborn and obstinate, might have appeared incredible: he therefore removes this stumblingblock, by declaring that the covenant included a gratuitous remission of sins. For we may gather from the words of the Prophet, — that God would have no more to do with his apostate people, until he should remit the crime of perfidy, as well as their other sins. </p><p><strong>(365)</strong> The former part of it is, “This is my covenant,” but not the latter, “when I shall take away their sins.” Some suppose that this is taken from <span class="bvs">Isa_27:9</span>, where we find this phrase in the <em>Septuagint</em>, “When I shall take away his sins<span class="lang el-gr">,” τὴν ἁμαρτίαν αὐτου: </span> but the Hebrew is somewhat different and farther from the form of the sentence here. We must therefore consider it as an abridgment of what is contained in <span class="bvs">Jer_31:33</span>, and quoted in <span class="bvs">Heb_8:10</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
