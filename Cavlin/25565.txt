<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled. </em>This clause makes it evident that ambition was the subject of which Christ was speaking; for he does not state what usually happens in the ordinary life of men, but declares that God will be their Judge, who <em>resisteth the proud, </em>and humbleth their haughtiness, <em>but giveth grace to the humble, </em>(<span class="bvs">Jas_4:6</span>; <span class="bvs">1Pe_5:5</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_138:6</span>.) Scripture is full of similar testimonies, that God is an enemy to all who desire to exalt themselves, as all who claim for themselves any merit must of necessity make war with Him. It is a manifestation of pride to boast of the gifts of God, as if there were any excellence in ourselves, that would exalt us on the ground of our own merit. Humility, on the other hand, must be not only an unfeigned abasement, but a real annihilation of ourselves, proceeding from a thorough knowledge of our own weakness, the entire absence of lofty pretensions, and a conviction that whatever excellence we possess comes from the grace of God alone. </p></div>
