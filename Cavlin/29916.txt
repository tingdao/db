<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Sound speech, unblamable </em><span class="cite-ref">(245)</span> “Sound speech” relates (in my opinion) to ordinary life and familiar conversation; for it would be absurd to interpret it as relating to public instruction, since he only wishes that Titus, both in his actions and in his words, shall lead a life that agrees with his preaching. He therefore enjoins that his words shall be pure and free from all corruption. </p><p><em>Unblamable </em>may apply either to the words or the person of Titus. I prefer the latter view, that the other nouns in the accusative case (which the Greek syntax easily allows) may depend upon it in this sense — “that thou mayest shew thyself unblamable in gravity, in integrity, and in sound words.” </p><p><em>That the adversary may be ashamed</em>. Although a Christian man ought to look at other objects, yet this must not be neglected, to shut the mouth of wicked men, as we are everywhere taught that we should give no occasion for slander. Everything that they can seize on as improper in our conduct is maliciously turned against Christ and his doctrine. The consequence is, that, through our fault, the sacred name of God is exposed to insult. Accordingly, the more we perceive that we are keenly observed by enemies, let us be the more attentive to guard against their calumnies, and thus let their malignity strengthen in us the desire of doing well. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(245)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Irreprehensible, ou qu’on ne puisse condemner</span>.” — “Unblamable, or that cannot be condemned.” </p></div></div>
