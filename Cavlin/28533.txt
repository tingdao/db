<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>But to us there is but one God, the Father </em>Though Paul says these things by anticipation, he repeats the excuse made by the Corinthians, in such a way as at the same time to convey instruction. For, from what is more especially peculiar to God, he proves that there is but one God: “Whatever has its origin from what is foreign to itself, is not eternal, and, consequently, is not God. All things have their origin from one Being: he alone, therefore, is God.” Again — “<em>He </em>is assuredly God who gives existence to all, and from whom all things flow, as from the supreme source; but there is only <em>One</em>, from whom all things flow, and hence <em>there is but one God</em>. ” When he adds — and <em>we in him</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">εἰς αὐτόν,</span>) he means, that we subsist in God, as it was by him that we were once created. For this clause might, indeed, seem to have another signification — that as we have our beginning from him, so we ought to devote our life to him as its end; and it is used in this sense in <span class="bvs">Rom_11:36</span>. Here, however, it is taken for <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, which is commonly made use of by the Apostles. His meaning, therefore, is, that as we were once created by God, so it is by his power that we are preserved in our present condition. That this is its meaning, is evident from what he affirms respecting Christ immediately afterwards — that we are <em>by him </em>For he designed to ascribe the same operation to the Father and to the Son, adding, however, the distinction which was suitable to the Persons. He says, then, that we subsist <em>in </em>the Father, and that it is <em>by </em>the Son, because the Father is indeed the foundation of all existence; but, as it is by the Son that we are united to him, so he communicates to us through him the reality of existence. </p><p><em>One Lord </em>These things are affirmed respecting Christ relatively, that is, in relationship to the Father. For all things that are God’s are assuredly applicable to Christ, when no mention is made of persons; but as the person of the Father is here brought into comparison with the person of the Son, it is with good reason that the Apostle distinguishes what is peculiar to them. </p><p>Now the Son of God, after having been manifested in the flesh, received from the Father dominion and power over all things, that he might reign alone in heaven and on earth, and that the Father might exercise his authority through his hands. For this reason our Lord is spoken of as one. <span class="cite-ref">(466)</span> But in respect of dominion being ascribed to him alone, this is not to be taken as meaning that worldly distinctions <span class="cite-ref">(467)</span> are abolished. For Paul speaks here of spiritual dominion, while the governments of the world are political; as when he said a little before — <em>there are many that are called lords </em>— (<span class="bvs">1Co_8:5</span>) — he meant that, not of kings, or of others who excel in rank and dignity, but of idols or demons, to whom foolish men ascribe superiority and rule. While, therefore, our religion acknowledges but one Lord, this is no hindrance in the way of civil governments having many lords, to whom honor and respect are due in that <em>one Lord </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(466)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour ceste raison quand il est parle de nostre Seigneur, il est dit que nous n’en auons qu’vn, assauoir Christ</span>;” — “For this reason, when mention is made of our Lord, it is declared that we have only one, namely, Christ.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(467)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les degrez, estats, et gouuernemens du monde</span>;” — “Ranks, conditions, and governments of the world.” </p></div></div>
