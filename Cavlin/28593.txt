<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>The earth is the Lord’s </em>He establishes, from the testimony of David, the liberty which he had allowed. (<span class="bvs">Psa_24:1</span>, and <span class="bvs">Psa_50:12</span>.) But it will be asked by some one, “What has this to do with the point?” I answer, If <em>the fullness of the earth </em><span class="cite-ref">(599)</span><em>is the Lord’s</em>, there is nothing in the world that is not sacred and pure. We must always keep in view, what the question is of which the Apostle treats. It might be doubted, whether the creatures of God were polluted by the sacrifices of the wicked. Paul says they are not, inasmuch as the rule and possession of the whole earth remain always in the hands of God. Now, what things the Lord has in his hands, he preserves by his power, and consequently sanctifies them. The sons of God, therefore, have the pure use of everything, because they receive them no otherwise than from the hand of God. </p><p>The <em>fullness of the earth</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(600)</span> is an expression which is made use of by the Prophet to denote the abundance of blessings, with which the earth is furnished and adorned by the Lord. For if the earth were stripped of trees, herbs, animals, and other things, it would be like a house devoid of furniture and every kind of utensil: nay more, it would be mutilated and disfigured. Should any one object, that the earth is cursed on account of sin, the answer is easy — that he has an eye to its pure and perfect nature, because Paul is speaking of believers, to whom all things are sanctified through Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(599)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est ‘a dire, le contenu d’icelle</span>;” — “That is to say, what it contains.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(600)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lequel mot nous auons traduit, Le contenu de la terre</span>;” — “Which expression we have rendered — What the earth contains.” </p></div></div>
