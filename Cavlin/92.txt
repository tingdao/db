<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>When thou tillest the ground</em>. This verse is the exposition of the former; for it expresses more clearly what is meant by being cursed <em>from </em>the earth, namely, that the earth defrauds its cultivators of the fruit of their toil. Should any one object that this punishment had before been alike inflicted on all mortals, in the person of Adam; my answer is, I have no doubt that something of the benediction which had hitherto remained, was now further withdrawn with respect to the murderer, in order that he might privately feel the very earth to be hostile to him. For although, generally, God causes his sun daily to rise upon the good and the evil, (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:45</span>,) yet, in the meantime, (as often as he sees good,) he punished the sins, sometimes of a whole nation, and sometimes of certain men, with rain and hail, and clouds, so far, at least, as is useful to give determinate proof of future judgment; and also for the purpose of admonishing the world, by such examples, that nothing can succeed when God is angry with and opposed to them. Moreover in the first murder, God designed to exhibit a singular example of malediction, the memory of which should remain in all ages. </p><p><em>A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be </em><span class="cite-ref">(246)</span> Another punishment is now also inflicted; namely, that he never could be safe, to whatever place he might come. Moses uses two words, little differing from each other, except that the former is derived from <span class="lang he-il">נוע</span><em>noa</em>, which is to <em>wander</em>, the other from <span class="lang he-il">נדד</span><em>nadad</em>, which signifies to <em>flee</em>. The distinction which some make, that <span class="lang he-il">נע</span><em>na </em>is he who never has a settled habitations but <span class="lang he-il">נד</span><em>nad</em>, he who knows not which way he ought to turn; as it is defective in proof, is with me of no weight. The genuine sense then of the words is, that wherever Cain might come, he should be <em>unsettled </em>and a <em>fugitive</em>; as robbers are wont to be, who have no quiet and secure resting-place; for the face of every man strikes terror into them; and, on the other hand, they have a horror of solitude. But this seems to some by no means a suitable punishment for a murderer, since it is rather the destined condition of the sons of God; for they, more than all others, feel themselves to be strangers in the world. And Paul complains that both he and his companions are without a certain dwelling-place, (<span class="bvs">1Co_4:11</span><span class="cite-ref">(247)</span>) To which I answer, that Cain was not only condemned to personal exile, but was also subjected to still more severe punishment; namely, that he should find no region of the earth where he would not be of a restless and fearful mind; for as a good conscience is properly called ‘a brazen walls’ so neither a hundred walls, nor as many fortresses, can free the wicked from disquietude. The faithful are strangers upon the earth, yet, nevertheless, they enjoy a tranquil temporary abode. Often, constrained by necessity, they wander from place to place, but wheresoever the tempest bears them, they carry with them a sedate mind; till finally by perpetual change of place, they so run their course, and pass through the world, that they are everywhere sustained by the supporting hand of God. Such security is denied to the wicked, whom all creatures threaten; and should even all creatures favor them, still the mind itself is so turbulent that it does not suffer them to rest. In this manner, Cain, even if he bad not changed his place, could not have shaken off the trepidation which God had fixed in his mind; nor did the fact, that he was the first man who built a city, prevent him from being always restless even in his own nest. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(246)</span> “<span class="lang el-gr">στένων κάι τρέμων</span>.” “Groaning and trembling.” — <em>Sept </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(247)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Instabiles esse conqueritur.” </p></div></div>
