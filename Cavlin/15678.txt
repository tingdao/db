<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>And he lifted up. </em>He describes another example of the vengeance of God, the recollection of which ought to have been deeply seated in their hearts, so that cherishing a constant fear of him, they might watch over themselves with the utmost solicitude. No good having ensued from all this, it is obvious that the madness of that people was incurable. At that time God did restrain his anger, in that he did not disperse their offspring throughout various parts of the earth; but his threatening of itself ought to have sufficed for the subduing of their pride, had they not been incorrigible. <em>To lift up the hand </em>is in this passage susceptible of two meanings. In Scripture God is frequently said to lift up his hand to inflict punishment. But as it is generally admitted that the prophet is here speaking of swearing, <span class="cite-ref">(256)</span> with this opinion I most readily coincide. The practice of lifting up the hand, as if they would have called God down from heaven, was a solemn usual rite among them, accompanying an oath; and is therefore improperly applied to God, whose sublimity rises above all things, and who, as the apostle says, cannot swear by a greater than himself, (<span class="bvs">Heb_6:13</span>) In employing it, therefore, it must be understood that he borrows it from the common customs which prevail among men. Had not the Holy Land been preserved to the people by the prayers of Moses, awful indeed would their dispersion have been. </p><p><strong>(256)</strong> The passage refers to the oath which God swore against that people recorded in <span class="bvs">Num_14:21</span>. To the same oath there is an allusion in <span class="bvs">Psa_95:11</span>. The Chaldee paraphrast has, “He lifted up his hand with an oath.” </p></div>
