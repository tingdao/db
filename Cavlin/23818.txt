<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>You know that the princes of the Gentiles rule over them. </em>It is first said that Christ <em>called them to him, </em>that he might reprove them in private; and next we learn from it that, being ashamed of their ambition, they did not openly complain, but that a sort of hollow murmur arose, and every one secretly preferred himself to the rest. He does not explain generally how deadly a plague ambition is, but simply warns them, that nothing is more foolish than to fight about nothing. <span class="cite-ref">(662)</span> He shows that the primacy, which was the occasion of dispute among them, has no existence in his kingdom. Those persons, therefore, who extend this saying indiscriminately to all the godly are mistaken; for Christ only takes occasion from the present occurrence to show that it is absurd in the apostles to dispute about the degree of power and honor in their own rank, because the office of teaching, to which they were appointed, has no resemblance to the governments of the world. I do acknowledge that this doctrine applies both to private persons and to kings and magistrates; for no man deserves to be reckoned one of Christ’s flock, unless he has made such proficiency under the teacher of humility, as to claim nothing for himself, but condescend to cultivate brotherly love. This is, no doubt, true; but the design of Christ was, as I have said, to distinguish between the spiritual government of his Church and the empires of the world, that the apostles might not look for the favors of a court; for in proportion as any of the nobles is loved by kings, he rises to wealth and distinction. But Christ appoints pastors of his Church, not to <em>rule</em>, but to <em>serve </em></p><p>This reflects the error of the Anabaptists, who exclude kings and magistrates from the Church of God, because Christ declares <span class="cite-ref">(663)</span> that they are not like his disciples; though the comparison is here made not between Christians and ungodly men, but between the nature of their offices. Besides, Christ did not look so much at the persons of men as at the condition of his Church. For it was possible that one who was governor of a village or of a city might, in a case of urgent necessity, discharge also the office of teaching; but Christ satisfied himself with explaining what belongs to the apostolic office and what is at variance with it. </p><p>But a question arises, Why does Christ, who appointed separate orders in his Church, disown in this passage all degrees? For he appears to throw them all down, or, at least, to place them on a level, so that not one rises above the rest. But natural reason prescribes a very different method; and Paul, when describing the government of the Church, (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:11</span>,) enumerates the various departments of the ministry, in such a manner as to make the rank of apostleship higher than the office of pastors. Timothy and Titus also, are unquestionably enjoined by him to exercise authoritative superintendence over others, according to the command of God. I reply, if we carefully examine the whole, it will be found that even kings do not rule justly or lawfully, unless they serve; but that the apostolic office differs from earthly government in this respect, that the manner in which kings and magistrates serve does not prevent them from governing, or indeed from rising above their subjects in magnificent pomp and splendor. Thus David, Hezekiah, and others of the same class, while they were the willing servants of all, used a scepter, a crown, a throne, and other emblems of royalty. But the government of the Church admits nothing of this sort; for Christ allowed the pastors nothing more than to be ministers, and to abstain entirely from the exercise of authority. Here, to it ought to be observed, that the discourse relates to the thing itself rather than to the disposition. Christ distinguishes between the apostles and the rank of kings, not because kings have a right to act haughtily, but because the station of royalty is different from the apostolic office. While, therefore, both ought to be humble, it is the duty of the apostles always to consider what form of government the Lord has appointed for his Church. </p><p>As to the words which Matthew employs, <em>the princes of the Gentiles rule over them, </em>Luke conveys the same import by saying, <em>they are called benefactors; </em>which means, that kings possess great wealth and abundance, in order that they may be generous and bountiful. For though kings have greater delight in their power, and a stronger desire that it should be formidable, than that it should be founded in the consent of the people, still they desire the praise of munificence. <span class="cite-ref">(664)</span> Hence, too, they take the name in the Hebrew language, <span class="lang he-il">נדיבים</span>, <em>(nedibim ) </em>They are so called from <em>bestowing gifts; </em><span class="cite-ref">(665)</span> for taxes and tributes are paid to them for no other purpose than to furnish the expense necessary to the magnificence of their rank. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(662)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il n’y a point de folie plus grande, que de debattre d’une chose qui n’est point</span>;” — “that there is no greater folly than to debate about a thing which does not exist.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(663)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sous couleur de ce que Christ dit</span>;” — “under the pretense of what Christ says.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(664)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Toutesfois ils appetent d’avoir la louange d’estre magnifiques et liberaux</span>;” — “yet they desire to have the praise of being sumptuous and liberal.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(665)</span><span class="lang he-il">נדיב</span><em>(nadib</em>, <em>)alvrince</em>, which is derived from <span class="lang he-il">נדב</span><em>(nadab</em>, <em>) to be bountiful, </em>is the very word to which allusion is supposed to be made in the passage, ( <span class="bvs">Luk_22:25</span>,) where it is said that the name <em>princes </em>( <span class="lang he-il">נדיבים</span><em>, nedibim</em>) signifies <em>benefactors</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
