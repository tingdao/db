<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And if a stranger sojourn with you. </em>He does not mean all strangers, but only those who, descending from heathen nations, had professedly turned to God, and thus had been received into the body of the Church; for the uncleanness of those who remained in uncircumcision excluded them from the legal service. I conceive that there were two reasons why God would have one and the same form observed;<em>first, </em>that the proselytes who had been lately incorporated might more cheerfully devote themselves to the exercises of piety, when they saw themselves placed in the same position as the children of Abraham; and <em>secondly, </em>lest if any distinction should be made, corrupt mixtures should immediately creep in. Lest, therefore, the purity of Godâ€™s worship should be gradually corrupted by absurd imitation, the gate was shut against that variety which usually draws men aside in different directions. </p></div>
