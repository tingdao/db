<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>Thou shalt not delay. </em>We may gather from this passage that the first-fruits were offered, to the end that the Israelites should devote themselves and their possessions to God; for Moses enjoins these two things in conjunction, that they should not delay to consecrate to God of the abundance of their fresh fruits, and their first-born. But we know that, in offering the first-born, the recollection of their deliverance was revived, by the acknowledgment of the preservation of their race, and of their cattle. And there was, moreover, added to the grace of their redemption, the continual supply of food to them from day to day. I do not assent to their opinion who restrict the word <em>fullness </em><span class="cite-ref">(339)</span> to wine, because it flows more abundantly from the press, and take the word <em>tear </em><span class="cite-ref">(340)</span> to mean oil, because it runs less freely; nor do I approve of their notion who apply<em>fullness </em>only to dry fruits. It seems to me more proper to take <em>fullness </em>as the generic term, whilst <em>tear </em>is taken to denote liquids, as if Moses commanded them not only to offer grapes, and olive-berries, but the very drops which were expressed from the fruit. The other passages confirm this command, that they should not defraud God of the first-fruits, and so bury the remembrance of their redemption, and profane themselves in their very eating and drinking, but rather by this portion of the fruits sanctify the food of the whole year. Nor is it causelessly that Moses so often inculcates a point by no means obscure, since all these admonitions were despised and neglected by the Jews, as soon as they had returned from the Babylonish captivity, as Malachi complains in his third chapter. </p><p><strong>(339)</strong><em>Vide </em>margin, — <em>A.
