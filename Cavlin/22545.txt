<div class="comment-content"><p>This verse shows that the sailors and the rest were more inclined to mercy, when they saw that the holy Prophet was willing to undergo the punishment which he had deserved. When therefore, he confessed that he was guilty, and refused not to be punished, they became anxious to spare his life, though they were heathens, and also for the most part barbarians: and as each of them could not but be frightened with his immediate danger, the wonder is increased, that they had such regard for the life of one who alone was in fault, and who had now freely confessed this. But the Lord so turned their hearts, that they now saw more clearly how grievous a sin it was to flee away from the call of God, and not to yield obedience, as we have before observed, to his command. Many think that this is a light offense, and readily indulge themselves in it: but it is not in the power of men to weigh sins; the balance is deceitful when men estimate their sins according to their own judgment. Let us then learn to ascribe to God his own honor, — that he alone is Judge, and is far above us, and can alone determine how grievous or how slight any sin is. But common sense, except when men willfully deceive themselves by vain flatteries, clearly teaches this, — that it is no light offense when we evade the command of God; for, as we have stated, men do thus take away from God his supreme authority; and what is left to God, when he governs not the creatures whom he has formed, and whom he sustains by his power? The Lord, then, designed to show here, that his displeasure could not be otherwise pacified than by drowning Jonah in the sea; though, as we shall presently see, he had something greater in view. But, in the meantime, this is worthy of being observed, — that the Lord intended to make Jonah an example, that all may now know that he is not to be trifled with, but that he ought to be obeyed as soon as he commands any thing. </p><p>The word which the Prophet uses has been variously explained by interpreters. <span class="lang he-il">חתר</span>, <em>chetar, </em>is properly, to dig; so that some think it to be a metaphorical expression, as rowers seem to dig the sea; and this sense is not unsuitable. Others carry the metaphor still higher, — that the sailors searched out or sought means by which they might drive the ship to land. But the other metaphor, as being less remote, is more to be approved. The Latins call it to toil, (<em>moliri </em>) when the rowers not only apply gently their oars, but when they make a greater effort. <em>The sailors, </em>then, <em>toiled to bring back the ship </em><span class="cite-ref">(29)</span> But for what purpose? To spare the life of the man who had already confessed that he was guilty before God, and that the storm, which threatened them all with a shipwreck, had arisen through his fault: but he says that they could not, for the sea was tempestuous, as we have already seen in our yesterday’s lecture. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(29)</span> Literally, “and the men labored to return to dry land.” The ideal meaning of <span class="lang he-il">חתר</span> is to dig, or to dig through, <span class="bvs">Job_24:16</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_12:7</span> : but it is here in its secondary sense of laboring or toiling. <span class="lang he-il">להשיב</span>, to return, must be taken here intransitively, though generally it bears in Hiphil a transitive sense. “<span class="lang el-gr">Καί παρεβιαζοντο οι ανδρες του επιστρεψαι προς την γην</span> — And the men strove to return to land.” — <em>Sept. </em>And the men rowed hard to regain the land.” — <em>Henderson. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
