<div class="comment-content"><p>This shows how little attention Luke paid to observing the order of dates; for, after having detailed the miracle, he now relates what happened in the city of <em>Jericho </em>He tells us that, while Christ presented himself to the view of all, as he went along the streets, <em>Zaccheus </em>alone was very desirous to see him. For it was an evidence of intense desire that he <em>climbed up a tree; </em>since <em>rich </em>men are, for the most part, haughty, and plume themselves on affected gravity. It is possible, indeed, that others entertained the same wish, but this man was most properly singled out by Luke, both on account of his rank, and on account of his wonderful conversion, which took place suddenly. Now, though faith was not yet formed in <em>Zaccheus</em>, yet this was a sort of preparation for it; for it was not without a heavenly inspiration that he desired so earnestly to get a sight of Christ; I mean, in reference to that design which immediately appeared. Some were led, no doubt, by vain curiosity to run even from distant places, for the purpose of seeing Christ, but the event showed that the mind of <em>Zaccheus </em>contained some seed of piety. In this manner, before revealing himself to men, the Lord frequently communicates to them a secret desire, by which they are led to Him, while he is still concealed and unknown; and, though they have no fixed object in view, He does not disappoint them, but manifests himself in due time. </p></div>
