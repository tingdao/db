<div class="comment-content"><p>The angel treats here of Ptolemy Euergetes, the third king of Egypt, who succeeded his father Philadelphus. He collected large forces to revenge the insult offered to his sister, and thus carried on the war with Seleucus Callinicus, who had become king after his father’s death. The angel, therefore, now touches shortly on this war, by saying, <em>There shall stand up a shoot from the root of that queen. </em>Very possibly he was younger than his sister Berenice. He says, <em>He shall stand in his own degree, </em>meaning, in the royal rank. The interpretation of those who translate, He shall stand in his father’s rank, is forced. What is it then? <em>He shall stand in his own rank; </em>that is, he shall arrive at his own rank by hereditary right. Although, therefore, at first all thought the death of Berenice would be unrevenged through her father being dead, here the angel announces that her brother should be like a branch, and become the avenger of this great wickedness. <em>He shall stand, </em>then, <em>in his </em>rank, meaning, he shall arrive at the royal throne, <em>from </em>the <em>branch </em>or germ <em>of her root, </em>namely, Berenice. <em>He shall come with an army against Callinicus. </em>Profane writers bear witness to this. <em>And he shall come even to the fortification of the king of the north </em>He entered Syria, and caused so great a terror that many fortified cities surrendered themselves to him. During this war he drew to himself many cities which seemed impregnable; whence it is not surprising to find the angel stating his arrival at the fortifications. Some translate it “<em>dwelling-place, </em>” but without reason, and thus injure the Prophet’s meaning. <em>He shall come unto the very fortification, </em>meaning, he shall arrive in Syria, and shall posses many fortified cities. </p><p>He next adds, <em>And he shall work on them, </em>meaning, he shall prosper; for this word when used without any addition, implies in Hebrew performing great exploits. <em>He shall proceed </em>and acquire power over the greater part of Syria, <em>and shall prevail. </em>By this last word he explains how superior he should be to Callinicus. For this king sent for his younger brother whose fidelity he suspected, and thought it the safest course to treat with his enemy. But young Hierax, the hawk, determined to use that expedition to his own advantage. He was not content with his own province of Asia Minor, but he anticipated being his father’s sole heir, especially as he had hired some troops from Gaul, who had invaded Asia Minor, Bithynia, and other provinces. He was greatly puffed up, and betrayed his own covetousness. Seleucus Callinicus preferred making peace with his enemy to fostering his brother’s resources. At length Hierax more and more developed the perversity of his mind. For he openly declared war against his brother, to whose assistance he pretended to have come, after having been sent for according to agreement. His brother Seleucus had promised him a portion of Asia as far as Mount Taurus; and when he saw himself the victim of his impious and disgraceful snares, he openly waged war with his brother. But he was conquered at length, and thus received the reward of his impiety. Thus Ptolemy Euergetes prevailed, while he departed from Syria after spoiling his enemy, according to what follows — </p></div>
