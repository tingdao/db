<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Therefore my heart is glad. </em>In this verse the Psalmist commends the inestimable fruit of faith, of which Scripture every where makes mention, in that, by placing us under the protection of God, it makes us not only to live in the enjoyment of mental tranquillity, but, what is more, to live joyful and cheerful. The principal, the essential part of a happy life, as we know, is to possess tranquillity of conscience and of mind; as, on the contrary, there is no greater infelicity than to be tossed amidst a multiplicity of cares and fears. </p><p>But the ungodly, however much intoxicated with the spirit of thoughtlessness or stupidity, never experience true joy or serene mental peace; they rather feel terrible agitations within, which often come upon them and trouble them, so much as to constrain them to awake from their lethargy. In short, calmly to rejoice is the lot of no man but of him who has learned to place his confidence in God alone, and to commit his life and safety to his protection. When, therefore, encompassed with innumerable troubles on all sides, let us be persuaded, that the only remedy is to direct our eyes towards God; and if we do this, faith will not only tranquillise our minds, but also replenish them with fullness of joy. David, however, not only affirms that he is glad inwardly; he also makes his <em>tongue, </em>yea, even his<em>flesh, </em>sharers of this joy. And not without cause, for true believers not only have this spiritual joy in the secret affection of their heart, but also manifest it by the tongue, inasmuch as they glory in God as He who protects them and secures their salvation. The word <span class="lang he-il">כבוד</span>, <em>kabod, </em>properly signifies glory and excellence. I have, however, no doubt of its being here taken for <em>the tongue, </em><span class="cite-ref">(331)</span> as it is in <span class="bvs">Gen_49:6</span>; for otherwise the division which is obviously made in this verse of the person into three parts is not so distinct and evident. Farther, although the body is not free from inconveniences and troubles, yet as God defends and maintains not only our souls, but also our bodies, David does not speak groundlessly when he represents the blessing of dwelling in safety as extending to his flesh in common with his soul. </p><p><strong>(331)</strong> The reading of the Septuagint is, “<span class="lang el-gr">γλωσσα μου</span> ” “my tongue.” This is unquestionably the meaning. David uses the word <em>glory </em>for the organ by which God is glorified or praised. The Apostle Peter, in quoting this passage, (<span class="bvs">Act_2:26</span>,) reads, “my tongue.” See also <span class="bvs">Psa_36:12</span></p></div>
