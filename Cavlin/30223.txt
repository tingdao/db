<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Now no chastening, etc. </em>This he adds, lest we should measure Godâ€™s chastisements by our present feelings; for he shows that we are like children who dread the rod and shun it as much as they can, for owing to their age they cannot yet judge how useful it may be to them. The object, then, of this admonition is, that chastisements cannot be estimated aright if judged according to what the flesh feels under them, and that therefore we must fix our eyes on the end: we shall thus receive the <em>peaceable fruit of righteousness. </em>And by the <em>fruit of righteousness </em>he means the fear of the Lord and a godly and holy life, of which the cross is the teacher. He calls it<em>peaceable, </em>because in adversities we are alarmed and disquieted, being tempted by impatience, which is always noisy and restless; but being chastened, we acknowledge with a resigned mind how profitable did that become to us which before seemed bitter and grievous. <span class="cite-ref">(251)</span></p><p><strong>(251)</strong> See Appendix S 2. </p></div>
