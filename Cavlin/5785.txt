<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>I said, I would scatter them. </em>God again represents Himself in the character of a man, as if He were meditating opposite determinations, and restrained His vehemence in consideration of the impediments He encountered. What it amounts to, however, is this, that God suspended His final judgment upon them for no other reason but because He had regard to His own glory, which would else have been subjected to the taunts of the Gentiles. Hence the Jews were reminded that, whereas they had deserved certain destruction, they were preserved on no other grounds but because God was unwilling to give the reins to the insolence of the Gentiles. The expression <em>wrath, </em>is here used for arrogant boasting, because in their prosperity ungodly and profane men burst forth into cruelty; unless it be preferred to render it simply <em>irritation, </em><span class="cite-ref">(273)</span> in which sense it is used in <span class="bvs">2Kg_23:0</span> Immediately afterwards it is explained, “lest the adversaries should behave themselves strangely.” <span class="lang he-il">נכר</span>, <em>nacar, </em>signifies sometimes to be strange, sometimes to put on a different face, sometimes to acknowledge. Thus I do not doubt but that Moses meant to express the arrogance of those who in a manner transform themselves that they may dazzle the eyes of the simple by their pomp and empty exaltation. If any approve of a different sense, i.e., lest they should separate themselves from God, and arrogate to themselves what belongs to Him alone, I make no objection: and this, indeed, seems to agree with what follows, <span class="cite-ref">(274)</span> “Our high hand, and not the Lord, has done this:” for when men indulge in such unbridled license, they go so far astray as to have nothing in common with God. Thus the judgment of God, which should have been conspicuous in these punishments, would have been put out of sight, when the enemies appropriated to themselves the glory of the people’s destruction. Nevertheless the ungodly did not cease to pride themselves on their victories, (as God complains by Isaiah, and Habakkuk confirms;) <span class="cite-ref">(275)</span> although their insolence was in some measure repressed, as long as there were some remnants of the elect people preserved. <span class="cite-ref">(276)</span></p><p>It is only figuratively that God says, he feared this insolence, which He might have easily remedied and restrained: but I have already stated, that He speaks after the manner of men, to show the Israelites that they escaped rather on account of their enemies, than by their own merits. The question, however, arises, how such a consultation as this could have taken place after God had determined to <em>consume </em>them with the fire of His wrath; <span class="cite-ref">(277)</span> I reply, that the <em>consump </em>tion there indicated was not such as totally to annihilate the nation, so that no ruins should remain as witnesses of their former state; whereas He now speaks of the destruction, which should altogether blot out the name of the nation, as if it had never been chosen by God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(273)</span><em>Hebr., </em><span class="lang he-il">כעס</span><em>, cagnas, </em>used in the plural number in <span class="bvs">2Kg_23:26</span>, and translated in <em>A.
