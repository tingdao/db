<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet was also reminded to be attentive to the vision — <em>What seest thou? </em>Then there was presented to him a sight which we have described; but the Prophet by seeing could have seen nothing, had he not been instructed by the Angel. We must also observe, that this tardiness of the Prophet is useful to us; for we hence more surely conclude, that nothing was represented without a design; but that the whole was introduced for his benefit, though he overlooked, as with closed eyes, what God showed to him by the Angel. We then conclude that there was nothing done by chance, but that the Prophet was really under a divine guidance, so that he might learn what he was afterwards faithfully to deliver to others. </p><p>The vision is then narrated — that a candlestick of God was shown to him. The substance of the candlestick was intended to set forth a mystery. It is indeed true that gold is corruptible; but as we cannot otherwise understand what exceeds the things of the world, the Lord, under the figure of gold, and silver, and precious stones, sets forth those things which are celestial, and which surpass in value the earth and the world. It was for this purpose that God commanded a candlestick to be made of gold for him, not that he needed earthly wealth or riches, or was pleased with them as men are, whose eyes are captivated by the sight of gold and silver. We indeed know that all these things are counted as nothing before God; but regard was had in these symbols to this — that they might know that something sublime and exalted was to be understood whenever they looked on the golden candlestick. Hence by the gold the Prophet must have learnt, that what was here set forth was not worthless or mean, but unusual and of great importance. </p><p>He afterwards says that there was a <em>vessel</em>, or some render it a pot; but it was a round vessel, and it was <em>on the top of the candlestick</em>; for the lamps burned on the very summit of the candlestick. Now there was a pot or bowl; and here there was a little difference between the candlestick of the temple and that of which the Prophet speaks now; for in the candlestick of the temple there were many pots or bowls, but here the Prophet says that there was but one; and also that there were seven pourers or postings; for by this term we may understand the very act of pouring, as well as the instruments themselves. But it is better to refer this to the pourers, which distilled the oil continually, that the wick might not become dry, but gather always new strength. He says that there were seven pourers to the lamps on the top; <span class="cite-ref">(45)</span> and also that there were <em>two olive-trees</em>, which supplied new abundance, so that the oil was always flowing. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(45)</span> Literally it is, “seven and seven pourers,” or pipes, or tubes “to the lamps” or lights. Some, as <em>Henderson</em>, regard the first “seven” as an interpolation, and it is not in the <em>Septuagint </em>nor <em>Vulgate</em>. Others, as <em>Newcome</em>, receive it, and place it before lamps — “to the seven lamps.” If “seven and seven” be taken as a form to express fourteen, then there were two pipes to convey the oil from the bowl to each lamp, answerable to the two olive-trees which supplied the oil; and it may be that this was expressed in order to intimate with more distinctness that the oil proceeded equally to each lamp from the two olive-trees. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
