<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>. She who is in luxury</em>. After having described the marks by which real widows may be known, he now contrasts them with others that ought not to be received. The Greek participle which he employs<span class="lang el-gr">, σπαταλῶσα, </span> means one who allows herself every indulgence, and leads an easy and luxurious life. Accordingly, Paul (in my opinion) censures those who abuse their widowhood for this purpose, that, being loosed from the marriage yoke, and freed from every annoyance, they may lead a life of pleasant idleness; for we see many who seek their own freedom and convenience, and give themselves up to excessive mirth. </p><p><em>Is dead while she liveth </em>When Paul says that such persons “are dead while they live,” this is supposed by some to mean that they are unbelievers; an opinion with which I do not at all agree. I think it more natural to say that a woman “is dead,” when she is useless, and does no good; for to what purpose do we live, if it be not that our actions may yield some advantage? And what if we should say that the emphasis lies in the word liveth? For they who covet an indolent life, that they may live more at their ease, have constantly in their mouth the proverbial saying: — </p><p><em>“For life is not to live, but to be well.” </em><span class="cite-ref">(89)</span></p><p>The meaning would therefore be: “If they reckon themselves happy, when they have everything to their heart’s wish, and if they think that nothing but repose and luxury can be called life, for my part, I declare that they are dead.” But as this meaning might seem liable to the charge of excessive ingenuity, I wished merely to give a passing glimpse of it, without making any positive assertion. This at least is certain, that Paul here condemns indolence, when he calls those women dead who are of no use. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(89)</span>Non est vivere, sed valere vita. </p></div></div>
