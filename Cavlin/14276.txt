<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Prove me, </em><span class="cite-ref">(568)</span><em>O Jehovah! </em>The more that David observed himself basely and undeservedly pursued with calumnies, the more powerfully was he excited by the vehemence of his grief fearlessly to assert his rectitude. Nor does he merely clear himself of outward sins; he glories also in the uprightness of his heart, and the purity of its affections, tacitly comparing himself, at the same time, with his enemies. As they were gross hypocrites, proudly boasting of their reverence for God, he lays open before him their shameless effrontery and hardihood. This protestation, too, shows how intimately acquainted he was with himself, when he durst offer to submit the whole recesses of his heart to the examination of God. It is to be observed, however, that it was the wickedness of his enemies which forced him to commend himself so much. Had he not been unjustly condemned by men, he would have humbly deprecated such an examination, as he well knew, notwithstanding his zeal to act aright, that he was far from perfection. But when he felt himself to be falsely accused, the injustice and cruelty of men emboldened him to appeal to God’s judgment-seat without hesitation. And as he knew that an external appearance of innocence was of no avail there, he brings forward the honest uprightness of his heart. The distinction which some make here, that <em>the heart </em>signifies the higher affections, and <em>the reins </em>those that are sensual (as they term them) and more gross, is more subtle than solid. We know that the Hebrews understood by the term <em>reins </em>that which is most secret in men. David, therefore, conscious of his innocence, offers the whole man to the examination of God; not like careless, or rather stupid men, who, flattering themselves, imagine that they will deceive God with their pretences. It is evident, on the contrary, that he had honestly and thoroughly searched himself, before he presented himself with such confidence in the divine presence. And this we must especially bear in mind, if we would desire to obtain the approbation of God, that when unjustly persecuted, we must not only abstain from retaliation, but also persevere in a right spirit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(568)</span> The primary signification of the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">צרף</span>, <em>tsaraph </em>is to try as the refiner tries his gold by dissolving and melting it, In this sense it is used in <span class="bvs">Psa_66:10</span>, “Thou hast tried us as silver is tried.” </p></div></div>
