<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>For the day will declare it </em>In the old translation it is <em>the day of the Lord</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(179)</span> but it is probable that the words <em>of the Lord </em>were added by some one by way of explanation. The meaning unquestionably is complete without that addition. For with propriety we give the name of <em>day </em>to the time when darkness and obscurity are dispelled, and the truth is brought to light. Hence the Apostle forewarns us, that it cannot always remain a secret who have acted fraudulently in the work of the Lord, or who have conducted themselves with fidelity, as though he had said: “The darkness will not always remain: the light will one day break forth; which will make all things manifest.” That day, I own, is God’s — not man’s, but the metaphor is more elegant if you read simply — <em>the day</em>, because Paul in this way conveys the idea, that the Lord’s true servants cannot always be accurately distinguished from false workmen, inasmuch as virtues and vices are concealed by the darkness of the night. That night, however, will not always continue. For ambition is blind — man’s favor is blind — the world’s applause is blind, but this darkness God afterwards dispels in his own time. Take notice, that he always discovers the assurance of a good conscience, and with an unconquerable magnanimity despises perverse judgments; <em>first</em>, in order that he may call back the Corinthians from popular applause to a right rule of judgment; and <em>secondly</em>, for the purpose of confirming the authority of his ministry. </p><p><em>Because it will be revealed by fire. </em>Paul having spoken of doctrine metaphorically, now also applies metaphorically the name of<em>fire </em>to the very touchstone of doctrine, that the corresponding parts of the comparison may harmonize with each other. The <em>fire</em>, then, here meant is the Spirit of the Lord, who tries by his touchstone what doctrine resembles <em>gold </em>and what resembles <em>stubble </em>The nearer the doctrine of God is brought to this fire, so much the brighter will be its luster. On the other hand, what has had its origin in man’s head will quickly vanish, <span class="cite-ref">(180)</span> as stubble is consumed in the fire. There seems also to be an allusion to <em>the day </em>of which he makes mention: “Not only will those things which vain ambition, like a dark night, concealed among the Corinthians, be brought to light by the brightness of the sun, but there will also be a strength of heat, not merely for drying up and cleansing away the refuse, but also for burning up everything wrong.” For however men may look upon themselves, as forming acute judgments, their discernment, notwithstanding, reaches no farther than appearance, which, for the most part, has no solidity. There is nothing but that <em>day </em>to which the Apostle appeals, that tests everything to the quick, not merely by its brightness, but also by its fiery flame. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(179)</span> It is so in two of the old English versions. In Wiclif’s version (1380) the rendering is as follows: <em>For the dai of the Lord schal declare</em>. The Rheims version (1582) reads thus: <em>For the day of our Lord will declare</em>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(180)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Celle, qui aura este forgee au cerveau des hommes s’esuanouira tout incontinent, et s’en ira en fumee</span>;” — “That which has been forged in man’s brain, will quickly vanish, and go off in smoke.” </p></div></div>
