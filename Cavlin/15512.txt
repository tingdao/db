<div class="comment-content"><p>The prophet next makes mention of the great benefits received from God, and, in an especial manner, desires the faithful to meditate upon them. To say <em>God made us </em>is a very generally acknowledged truth; but not to advert to the ingratitude so usual among men, that scarcely one among a hundred seriously acknowledges that he holds his existence from God, although, when hardly put to it, they do not deny that they were created out of nothing; yet every man makes a god of himself, and virtually worships himself, when he ascribes to his own power what God declares belongs to him alone. Moreover, it must be remembered that the prophet is not here speaking of creation in general, (as I have formerly said,) but of that spiritual regeneration by which he creates anew his image in his elect. Believers are the persons whom the prophet here declares to be God’s workmanship, not that they were made men in their mother’s womb, but in that sense in which Paul, in <span class="bvs">Eph_2:10</span>, calls them, <span class="lang el-gr">Τὸ ποιημα</span>, <em>the workmanship </em>of God, because they are created unto good works which God hath before ordained that they should walk in them; and in reality this agrees best with the subsequent context. For when he says, <em>We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture, </em>he evidently refers to that distinguishing grace which led God to set apart his children for his heritage, in order that he may, as it were, nourish them under his wings, which is a much greater privilege than that of merely being born men. Should any person be disposed to boast that he has of himself become a new man, who is there that would not hold in abhorrence such a base attempt to rob God of that which belongs to him? Nor must we attribute this spiritual birth to our earthly parents, as if by their own power they begat us; for what could a corrupt seed produce? Still the majority of men do not hesitate to claim for themselves all the praise of the spiritual life. Else what mean the preachers of free-will, unless it be to tell us that by our own endeavors we have, from being sons of Adam, become the sons of God? In opposition to this, the prophet in calling us the <em>people of God, </em>informs us that it is of his own good will that we are spiritually regenerated. And by denominating us <em>the sheep of his pasture, </em>he gives us to know that through the same grace which has once been imparted to us, we continue safe and unimpaired until the end. It might be otherwise rendered, <em>he made us his people, </em>etc. <span class="cite-ref">(124)</span> But as the meaning is not altered, I have retained that which was the more generally received reading. </p><p><strong>(124)</strong> The Hebrew text has a keri, which is <span class="lang he-il">ולו אנחנו</span>, “and we are his,” instead of <span class="lang he-il">ולא אנחנו</span> “and not ourselves.” The Septuagint supports the latter reading, the ketib, <span class="lang el-gr">καὶ οὐχ ἡμεῖς</span>, “and not we ourselves;” in which it is followed by the Syriac and Vulgate versions. Jerome agrees with the keri, <em>Ipse fecit nos</em>, <em>et ipsius sumus </em>; and so does the Chaldee. “I am persuaded,” says Lowth, in Merrick’s Annotations, “that the Masoretical correction, <span class="lang he-il">ולו</span>, (and we are <em>his</em>,) is right: the construction and parallelism both favour it.” </p></div>
