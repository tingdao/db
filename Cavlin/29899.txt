<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>For a bishop ought to be blameless, as a governor of the house of God </em>He again repeats, that they who aspire to the office of a bishop ought to retain an unspotted reputation; and he confirms it by this argument, that, because the Church is the house of God, every person who is appointed to govern it — is constituted, as it were, governor of the house of God. Now, he would be ill spoken of among men, who should take a scandalous and infamous person, and make him his steward; and therefore it would be far more base and intolerable to appoint such persons to be rulers of the household of God. The Latin word <em>dispensator </em> (steward or manager) — employed in the old translation, and retained by Erasmus — does not at all express Paul’s meaning; for, in order that greater care may be exercised in the election, he adorns the office of a bishop within this honorable eulogy, that it is a government of the house of God, as he says to Timothy, </p><p>“That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to conduct thyself in the house of the living God, the pillar and foundation of truth.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:15</span>.) </p><p>This passage plainly shows that there is no distinction between a presbyter and a bishop; for he now calls indiscriminately, by the latter name, those whom he formerly he employs both names in the same sense, without any distinction; as Jerome has remarked, both in his Commentary on this passage, and in his Epistle to Evagrius. And hence we may perceive how much greater deference has been paid to the opinions of men than ought to have been paid to them; for the language of the Holy Spirit, has been set aside, and the custom introduced by the arbitrary will of man has prevailed. For my own part, I do not find fault with the custom which has existed from the very beginning of the Church, that each assembly of bishops shall have one moderator; <span class="cite-ref">(221)</span> but that the name of office which God has given to all, shall be conveyed to one alone, and that all the rest shall be deprived of it, is both unreasonable and absurd. Besides, to pervert the language of the Holy Spirit — in such a manner that the same words shall have a different meaning from what he intended — is excessive and profane hardihood. <span class="cite-ref">(222)</span></p><p><em>Not self-willed </em>With good reason does he condemn this vice in a bishop, whose duty it is not only to receive kindly those who come to him of their own accord, but also to allure those who withdraw themselves, that he may conduct all in like manner to Christ. Now<span class="lang el-gr">, αὐθάδεια </span> (as Plato says in one of his Epistles to Dion)<span class="lang el-gr">τὢς ἐρημίας ἐστὶ ξύνοικος </span> that is, “self-will is closely allied to solitude;” for society and friendship cannot be cherished, when every man pleases himself to such an extent as to refuse to yield and accommodate himself to others. And, indeed, every (<span class="lang el-gr">αὐθάδης</span>) “self-willed” person, as soon as an occasion presents itself, will instantly become a fanatic. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(221)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Un gouverneur ou superintendaet</span>.” — “A governor or superintendent.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(222)</span> “Those whom he formerly called presbyters he now calls bishops, (which means overseers or superintendents,) and he gives this name to all whose duty it is to preach the word of God. And so it was a corruption and abuse in Popery — that is, in the ancient Church — that one individual was called bishop; for that was to change the language of the Holy Spirit, and we ought to speak in accordance with the Scripture. Now we see that Satan labors incessantly to draw us aside from the simplicity of the word of God.” — <em>Fr. Ser. </em></p></div></div>
