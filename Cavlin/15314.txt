<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>Free among the dead, lie the slain who lie in the grave. </em>The prophet intended to express something more distressing and grievous than common death. First, he says, that <em>he was free among the dead, </em>because he was rendered unfit for all the business which engages human life, and, as it were, cut off from the world. The refined interpretation of Augustine, that Christ is here described, and that he is said to be free among the dead, because he obtained the victory over death by a special privilege, that it might not have dominion over him, has no connection with the meaning of the passage. <span class="cite-ref">(510)</span> The prophet is rather to be understood as affirming, that having finished the course of this present life, his mind had become disengaged from all worldly solicitude; his afflictions having deprived him of all feeling. <span class="cite-ref">(511)</span> In the next place, comparing himself with <em>those who have been wounded, </em>he bewails his condition as worse than if, enfeebled by calamities, he were going down to death by little and little; for we are naturally inspired with horror at the prospect of a violent death. </p><p>What he adds, that <em>he is forgotten of God, and cut off from his hand </em>or <em>guardianship, </em>is apparently harsh and improper, since it is certain that the dead are no less under the Divine protection than the living. Even wicked Balaam, whose purpose it was to turn light into darkness, was, nevertheless, constrained to cry out, </p><p>“Let me die the death of the righteous, <LineBreak />and let my last end be like his,” (<span class="bvs">Num_23:10</span>.) </p><p>To say, then, that God is no longer mindful of man after he is dead, might seem to be the language of a heathen. To this it may be answered, That the prophet speaks according to the opinion of the generality of men; just as the Scriptures, in like manner, when treating of the providence of God, accommodate their style to the state of the world as presented to the eye, because our thoughts ascend only by slow degrees to the future and invisible world. I, however, think, that he rather gave utterance to those confused conceptions which arise in the mind of a man under affliction, than that he had an eye to the opinion of the ignorant and uninstructed part of mankind. Nor is it wonderful that a man endued with the Spirit of God was, as it were, so stunned and stupified when sorrow overmastered him, as to allow unadvised words to escape from his lips. Although faith in the truth that God extends his care both to the living and the dead is deeply rooted in the hearts of all his genuine servants, yet sorrow often so overclouds their minds as to exclude from them for the time all remembrance of his providence. From perusing the complaints of Job, we may perceive, that when the minds of the godly are preoccupied with sorrow, they do not immediately pierce to the consideration of the secret providence of God, which yet has been before the subject of their careful meditation, and the truth of which they bear engraven on their hearts. Although the prophet, then, was persuaded that the dead also are under the Divine protection, yet, in the first paroxysm of his grief, he spoke less advisedly than he ought to have done; for the light of faith was, as it were, extinguished in him, although, as we shall see, it soon after shone forth. This it will be highly useful particularly to observe, that, should we be at any time weakened by temptation, we may, nevertheless, be kept from falling into despondency or despair. </p><p><strong>(510)</strong><span class="lang he-il">גבר</span><em>geber</em>, therefore, denotes a <em>man </em>“when in vigorous manhood; who is neither a boy nor an old man, yet it is applied to Balaam, when old, in <span class="bvs">Num_24:4</span>.” — <em>Bythner </em></p><p><strong>(511)</strong> “‘Free among the dead,’ <em>inter mortuos liber</em>, ” says Dr Adam Clarke, “has been applied by the Fathers to our Lord’s voluntary death: all others were <em>obliged </em>to die; He alone <em>gave up his life</em>, and could take it again, (<span class="bvs">Joh_10:18</span>.) He went into the grave and came out when he <em>chose</em>. The dead are <em>bound </em>in the grave: <em>He </em>was <em>free</em>, and not obliged to continue in that state as they were.” </p></div>
