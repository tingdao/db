<div class="comment-content"><p>He says that they had <em>sown much</em>, and that <em>small was the produce</em>. They who render the clause in the future tense, wrest the meaning of the Prophet: for why did he say, apply your heart to your ways, if he only denounced a future punishment? But, as I have already stated, he intimates, that they very thoughtlessly champed the bridle, for they perceived not that all their evils were inflicted by God’s hand, nor did they regard his judgement as righteous. Hence he says, that they had sowed much, and that the harvest had been small; and then, that they <em>ate </em>and <em>were not satisfied</em>; that they <em>drank </em>and had not their <em>thirst quenched</em>; that they <em>clothed themselves </em>and were <em>not warmed</em>. How much soever they applied those things which seemed necessary for the support of life, they yet availed them nothing. And God, we know, does punish men in these two ways either by withdrawing his blessings, by rendering the earth and and the heavens dry; or by making the abundant produce unsatisfying and even useless. It often happens that men gather what is sufficient for support, and yet they are always hungry. It is a kind of curse, which appears very evident when God takes away their nourishing power from bread and wine, so that they supply no support to man. When therefore fruit, and whatever the earth produces for the necessities of man, give no support, God proves, as it were by an outstretched arm, that he is an avenger. But the other curse is more frequent; that is, when God smites the earth with drought, so that it produces nothing. But our Prophet refers to both these kinds of evils. Behold, he says, <em>Ye have sown much and ye gather little</em>; and then he says, Though ye are supplied with the produce of wine and corn, yet with eating and drinking ye cannot satisfy yourselves; nay, your very clothes do not make you warm. They might have had a sure hope of the greatest abundance, had they not broken off the stream of God’s favor by their sins. Were they not then extremely blind this experience must have awakened them, according to what is said in the <span class="bvs">Joe_1:0</span>. </p><p>He says at the end of the verse, <em>He who gains wages, gains then for a perforated bag</em>. By these words he reminds them, that the vengeance of God could not only be seen in the sterility of the earth, and in the very hunger of men, who by eating were not satisfied; but also in their work, for they wearied themselves much without any profit, as even the money cast into the bag disappeared. Hence he says, even your work is in vain. It was indeed a most manifest proof of God’s wrath, when their money, though laid up, yet vanished away. <span class="cite-ref">(136)</span></p><p>We now see what the Prophet means: As his doctrine appeared frigid to the Jews and his warnings were despised, he treats them according to the perverseness of their disposition. Hence he shows, that though they disregarded God and his Prophets, they were yet sufficiently taught by his judgements, and that still they remained indifferent. He therefore goads them, as though they were asses, that they might at length acknowledge that God was justly displeased with them, and that his wrath was conspicuous in the sterility of the land, as well as in everything connected with their life; for whether they did eat or abstained from food, they were hungry; and when they diligently labored and gathered wages, their wages vanished, as though they had cast them into a perforated bag. It follows— </p><p><strong>(136)</strong> There seems to be an irregularity in the construction of the whole verse. Literally it is as follows— </p><p>Ye have sown much, but the coming in is little; <LineBreak />There is eating, but not to satisfaction; <LineBreak />They drink, but not to fullness; <LineBreak />There is clothing, but there is no warmth in it; <LineBreak />And earn does the earner for a perforated bag. </p><p>This change in the mode of construction takes away the monotony which would have otherwise appeared. The word [<span class="lang he-il">הבא</span> ], [<span class="lang he-il">אכול</span> ], and [<span class="lang he-il">לבוש</span> ], are not infinitives, as some suppose, but participles used as nouns; which is often the case in Hebrew, as well as in Welsh, and often too in English, such as teaching, drinking, clothing, etc.—<em>Ed. </em></p></div>
