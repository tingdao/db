<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And Moses made haste, and bowed his head </em>This haste shews that Moses was astounded when he first beheld the brightness; for thus does God, when He reveals Himself, immediately ravish the godly into such admiration of Him, that there is no time for delay. <span class="cite-ref">(384)</span> This prayer follows, that God would journey with His people, and bear with their frowardness; for, since God had said that He could not possibly dwell with so stiff-necked and intractable a people, Moses proposes the remedy, viz., after he has confessed that the people are of a hardened and stubborn spirit, he still expresses a hope of their safety, if God will be pitiful in sparing them. What follows is worthy of observation, “that thou mayest possess us;” <span class="cite-ref">(385)</span> for the <em>copula </em>has the force of the causal particle, as if he had said, That God could not enjoy the inheritance He had chosen, unless by pardoning their sins. And surely so it is; for such is man’s frailty, that they would straightway fall from grace were they not reconciled to God. Nor was this spoken only of this ancient people, but refers also to us; for, in order that God should <em>possess </em>us too, it is needful that our sins should be constantly pardoned, as this embassy, according to Paul, daily resounds in the Church. (<span class="bvs">2Co_5:20</span>.) Consequently, not only does the origin of our salvation flow from gratuitous adoption, but its continual progress even to the end can only be accomplished by God’s freely reconciling us to Himself. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(384)</span> “Qu’ils n’ont point loisir de deliberer de ce qu’ils ont a faire, mais sont du premier coup abatus;” that they have no time to deliberate as to what they should do, but are abashed at once. — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(385)</span> “And take us for thine inheritance.” — <em>A.
