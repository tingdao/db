<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Do we begin </em>It appears that this objection also was brought forward against him — that he was excessively fond of publishing his own exploits, and brought against him, too, by those who were grieved to find that the fame, which they were eagerly desirous to obtain, was effectually obstructed in consequence of his superior excellence. They had already, in my opinion, found fault with the former Epistle, on this ground, that he indulged immoderately in commendations of himself. To <em>commend </em>here means to boast foolishly and beyond measure, or at least to recount one’s own praises in a spirit of ambition. Paul’s calumniators had a plausible pretext — that it is a disgusting <span class="cite-ref">(359)</span> and odious thing in itself for one to be the trumpeter of his own praises. Paul, however, had an excuse on the ground of <em>necessity, </em>inasmuch as he gloried, only because he was shut up to it. His design also raised him above all calumny, as he had nothing in view but that the honor of his apostleship might remain unimpaired for the edification of the Church; for had not Christ’s honor been infringed upon, he would readily have allowed to pass unnoticed what tended to detract from his own reputation. Besides, he saw that it was very much against the Corinthians, that his authority was lessened among them. In the first place, therefore, he brings forward their calumny, letting them know that he is not altogether ignorant as to the kind of talk, that was current among them. </p><p><em>Have we need? </em>The answer is suited (to use a common expression) to the person rather than to the thing, though we shall find him afterwards saying as much as was required in reference to the thing itself. At present, however, he reproves their malignity, inasmuch as they were displeased, if he at any time reluctantly, nay even when they themselves constrained him, made mention of the grace that God had bestowed upon him, while they were themselves begging in all quarters for epistles, that were stuffed entirely with flattering commendations. He says that he has no need of commendation in words, while he is abundantly commended by his deeds. On the other hand, he convicts them of a greedy desire for glory, inasmuch as they endeavored to acquire favor through the suffrages of men. <span class="cite-ref">(360)</span> In this manner, he gracefully and appropriately repels their calumny. We must not, however, infer from this, that it is absolutely and in itself wrong to receive recommendations, <span class="cite-ref">(361)</span> provided you make use of them for a good purpose. For Paul himself recommends many; and this he would not have done had it been unlawful. Two things, however, are required here — <em>first</em>, that it be not a recommendation that is elicited by flattery, but an altogether unbiassed testimony; <span class="cite-ref">(362)</span> and <em>secondly</em>, that it be not given for the purpose of procuring advancement for the individual, but simply that it may be the means of promoting the advancement of Christ’s kingdom. For this reason, I have observed, that Paul has an eye to those who had assailed him with calumnies. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(359)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mal sonnante aux aureilles</span>;” — “Sounding offensively to the ears.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(360)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par la faueur et recommandation des hommes</span>;” — “By the favor and recommendation of men.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(361)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Letres recommandatoires</span>;” — “Recommendatory letters.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(362)</span> “Enucleatum testimonium;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vn vray tesmoignage rendu d’vn iugement entier auec prudence et en verite</span>;” — “A true testimony, given with solid judgment, with prudence, and with truth.” Cicero makes use of a similar expression, which Calvin very probably had in his eye — “Enucleata suffragia;” — “Votes given judiciously, and with an unbiassed judgment.” — (Cic. Planc. 4.) — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
