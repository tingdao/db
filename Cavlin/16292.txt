<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>I cried unto thee, O Jehovah </em>! With a view to hasten God’s interposition, David complains of the low estate he was reduced to, and of his extremity; the term cry denoting vehemence, as I have elsewhere noticed. He speaks of deliverance as being plainly needed, since he was now held a prisoner. By <em>prison </em>some suppose he alludes to the cave where he was lodged, but this is too restricted a meaning. The subsequent clause, <em>the righteous shall compass me</em>, is translated differently by some, <em>they shall wait me</em>. I have retained the true and natural sense. I grant that it is taken figuratively for surrounding, intimating that he would be a spectacle to all, the eyes of men being attracted by such a singular case of deliverance. If any consider the words not to be figurative, the sense will be, That the righteous would not only congratulate him, but place a crown upon his head in token of victory. Some explain the passage, They will assemble to congratulate me, and will stand round me on every side like a crown. As the words literally read, <em>they will crown </em>upon me, some supply another pronoun, and give this sense, that the righteous would construe the mercy bestowed upon David as a glory conferred upon themselves; for when God delivers any of his children he holds out the prospect of deliverance to the rest, and, as it were, gifts them with a crown. The sense which I have adopted is the simplest, however, That the mercy vouchsafed would be shown conspicuously to all as in a theater, proving a signal example to the righteous for establishment of their faith. The verb <span class="lang he-il">גמל</span>, <em>gamal</em>, in the Hebrew, is of a more general signification than to repay, and means <em>to confer a benefit</em>, as I have shown elsewhere. </p></div>
