<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Then the soldiers of the governor. </em>It is not without reason that these additional insults are related. We know that it was not some sort of ludicrous exhibition, when God exposed his only-begotten Son to every kind of reproaches. First, then, we ought to consider what we have deserved, and, next, the satisfaction offered by Christ ought to awaken us to confident hope. Our filthiness deserves that God should hold it in abhorrence, and that all the angels should <em>spit </em>upon us; but Christ, in order to present us pure and unspotted in presence of the Father, resolved to be <em>spat upon, </em>and to be dishonored by every kind of reproaches. For this reason, that disgrace which he once endured on earth obtains for us favor in heaven, and at the same time restores in us the image of God, which had been not only stained, but almost obliterated, by the pollutions of sin. Here, too, is brightly displayed the inconceivable mercy of God towards us, in bringing his only-begotten Son so low on our account. This was also a proof which Christ gave of his astonishing love towards us, that there was no ignominy to which he refused to submit for our salvation. but these matters call for secret meditation, rather than for the ornament of words. </p><p>We are also taught that the kingdom of Christ ought not to be estimated by the sense of the flesh, but by the judgment of faith and of the Spirit. For so long as our minds grovel in the world, we look: upon his kingdom not only as contemptible, but even as loaded with shame and disgrace; but as soon as our minds rise by faith to heaven, not only will the spiritual majesty of Christ be presented to us, so as to obliterate all the dishonor of the cross, but the <em>spittings, scourgings, blows, </em>and other indignities, will lead us to the contemplation of his glory; as Paul informs us, that </p><p>God hath given him a name, and the highest authority, that before him every knee might bow, because he willingly emptied himself (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐκένωσε</span>) even to the death of the cross, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Phi_2:8</span>.) </p><p>If, therefore, even in the present day, the world insolently mocks at Christ, let us learn to rise above these offenses by elevated faith; and let us not stop to inquire, what unworthy opposition is made to Christ by wicked men, but with what ornaments the Father hath clothed him, with what scepter and with what crown he hath adorned him, so as to raise him high, not only above men, but even above all the angels. </p><p>Mark uses the word <em>purple </em>instead of <em>scarlet; </em>but though these are different colors, we need not trouble ourselves much about that matter. That Christ was clothed with a costly garment is not probable; and hence we infer that it was not <em>purple, </em>but something that bore a resemblance to it, as a painter counterfeits truth by his likenesses. </p></div>
