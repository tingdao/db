<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>For we are the circumcision </em>—that is, we are the true seed of Abraham, and heirs of the testament which was confirmed by the sign of circumcision. For the true circumcision is <em>of the spirit </em>and <em>not of the letter, </em>inward, and situated in the heart, not visible according to the flesh. (<span class="bvs">Rom_2:29</span>.) </p><p>By <em>spiritual worship </em>he means that which is recommended to us in the gospel, and consists of confidence in God, and invocation of him, self-renunciation, and a pure conscience. We must supply an antithesis, for he censures, on the other hand, legal worship, which was exclusively pressed upon them by the false Apostles. </p><p>“They command that God should be worshipped with outward observances, and because they observe the ceremonies of the law, they boast on false grounds that they are the people of God; but we are the truly circumcised, who worship God in spirit and in truth.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_4:23</span>.) </p><p>But here some one will ask, whether <em>truth excludes </em>the sacraments, for the same thing might be said as to Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. I answer, that this principle must always be kept in view, that figures were abolished by the advent of Christ, and that circumcision gave way to baptism. It follows, also, from this principle, that the pure and genuine worship of God is free from the legal ceremonies, and that believers have the true circumcision without any figure. </p><p><em>And we glory in Christ </em>We must always keep in view the antithesis. “We have to do with the reality, while they rest in the symbols: we have to do with the substance, while they look to the shadows.” And this suits sufficiently well with the corresponding clause, which he adds by way of contrast— <em>We have no confidence in the flesh </em>For under the term <em>flesh </em>he includes everything of an external kind in which an individual is prepared to glory, as will appear from the context, or, to express it in fewer words, he gives the name of <em>flesh </em>to everything that is apart from Christ. He thus reproves, and in no slight manner, the perverse zealots the law, because, not satisfied with Christ, they have recourse to grounds of glorying apart from him. He has employed the terms <em>glorying, </em>and <em>having confidence, </em>to denote the same thing. For confidence lifts up a man, so that he ventures even to glory, and thus the two things are connected. </p></div>
