<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Arise, O Jehovah? </em><span class="cite-ref">(134)</span> Such language as this, inviting the great God who fills heaven and earth to come into a new place of residence, might seem strange and harsh, but the external symbols of religion which God had appointed are spoken of in these exalted terms to put honor upon them, and the better to ensure to them the regard of God’s people. Should God institute no medium of intercourse, and call us to a direct communication with heaven, the great distance at which we stand from him would strike us with dismay, and paralyze invocation. Although, therefore, he does not thereby change place himself, he is felt by us to draw sensibly nearer. It was thus that he descended amongst his ancient people by the Ark of the Covenant, which he designed to be a visible emblem of his power and grace being present amongst them. Accordingly, the second clause of the verse is of an exegetical <em>character, </em>informing the Church that God was to be understood as having come in the sense of making a conspicuous display of his power in connection with the Ark. Hence it is called the <em>Ark of his strength, </em>not a mere dead idle shadow to look upon, but what certainly declared God’s nearness to his Church. By the <em>rest </em>spoken of we are to understand Mount Zion, because, as we shall see afterwards, God was ever afterwards to be worshiped only in that place. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(134)</span><em>Arise, O Jehovah! </em>were the words which Moses used (<span class="bvs">Num_10:35</span>) whenever in the journey through the wilderness the Ark moved forward; and this and the two following verses form a part of the prayer which Solomon offered at the dedication of the Temple, (<span class="bvs">2Ch_6:41</span>,) which might be considered as the resting­place of God and of the Ark. The Ark is here called “the Ark of thy strength” ­ that is, the symbol of thy power and majesty. This phrase is found only in this place and in the passage above cited. </p></div></div>
