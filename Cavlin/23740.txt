<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>What think you? </em>Luke carries the occasion of this parable still farther back, as having arisen from the <em>murmurings </em>of the <em>Pharisees and scribes </em>against our Lord, whom they saw conversing daily with sinners. Christ therefore intended to show that a good teacher ought not to labor less to recover those that are <em>lost</em>, than to preserve those which are in his possession; though according to Matthew the comparison proceeds farther, and teaches us not only that we ought to treat with kindness the disciples of Christ, but that we ought to bear with their imperfections, and endeavor, when they wander, to bring them back to the road. For, though they happen sometimes to wander, yet as they are <em>sheep </em>over which God has appointed his Son to be shepherd, so far are we from having a right to chase or drive them away roughly, that we ought to gather them from their wanderings; for the object of the discourse is to lead us to beware of <em>losing </em>what God wishes to be <em>saved </em>The narrative of Luke presents to us a somewhat different object. It is, that the whole human race belongs to God, and that therefore we ought to gather those that have gone astray, and that we ought to rejoice as much, when they that are <em>lost </em>return to the path of duty, as a man would do who, beyond his expectation, recovered something the loss of which had grieved him. </p></div>
