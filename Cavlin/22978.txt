<div class="comment-content"><p>Some think that at the beginning of this chapter the people are reproved for their unfaithfulness, because they conducted themselves towards God in a way they ought not to have done, as they had violated that sacred marriage which God had been pleased to contract with them; for it is a common mode of speaking for God to compare himself to jealous husbands, when he sees his Church dealing with him unfaithfully. But this meaning is inadmissible: for the verb <span class="lang he-il">קנא</span>, <em>kona</em>, connected as it is here, is to be taken in a good sense, as signifying concern or affection, inasmuch as <span class="lang he-il">ל</span>, <em>lamed</em>, means, “on account of,” or “for;” and we have in the first chapter a similar sentence; <span class="bvs">Zec_1:1</span> and it is evident that in many other places the meaning is no other, but that God burned with wrath against all the enemies of his Church, as he regarded his Church with singular love. Emulation then here does not mean jealousy, but is to be taken in a different sense, as signifying that concern which God had for the protection of his Church. The whole then of this chapter proves that God would be the defender of his people, and that such was his care for the safety of all the godly, that he resolved to oppose the whole world, if necessary, for their protection. This is the sum of the whole. </p></div>
