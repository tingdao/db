<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Which he shed, </em>(or, <em>whom he shed.) </em>In the Greek, the relative may apply either to the “washing” or to the “Spirit;” for both of the nouns<span class="lang el-gr">— λουτρόν </span> and <span class="lang el-gr">Πνεῦμα </span> — are neuter. It makes little difference as to the meaning; but the metaphor will be more elegant, if the relative be applied to<span class="lang el-gr">λουτρόν </span> the “washing” Nor is it inconsistent with this opinion, that all are baptized without any distinction; for, while he shews that the “washing” is “shed,” he speaks not of the sign, but rather of the thing signified, in which the truth of the sign exists. </p><p>When he, says, <em>abundantly, </em>he means that, the more any of us excels in the abundance of the gifts which he has received, so much the more is he under obligations to the mercy of God, which alone enriches us; for in ourselves we are altogether poor, and destitute of everything good. If it be objected that not all the children of God enjoy so great abundance, but, on the contrary, the grace of God drops sparingly on many; the answer is, that no one has received so small a measure that he may not be justly accounted rich; for the smallest drop of the Spirit (so to speak) resembles an ever-flowing fountain, which never dries up. It is therefore a sufficient reason for calling it “abundance,” that, how small soever the portion that has been given to us it is never exhausted. </p><p><em>Through Jesus Christ </em><span class="cite-ref">(261)</span> It is he alone in whom we are adopted; and therefore, it is he alone, through whom we are made partakers of the Spirit, who is the earnest and witness of our adoption. Paul therefore teaches us by this word, that the Spirit of regeneration is bestowed on none but those who are the members of Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(261)</span> “When we wish to ascertain the method of our salvation, we must begin with the Son of God. For it is he who hath washed us <em>by </em>his blood — it is he who hath obtained righteousness for us by his obedience — it is he who is our Advocate, and through whom we now find grace — it is he who procured for us the adoption by which we are made children and heirs of God. Let us carefully observe that we must seek all the parts of our salvation in Jesus Christ; for we shall not find a single drop of it anywhere else.” — <em>Fr. Ser. </em></p></div></div>
