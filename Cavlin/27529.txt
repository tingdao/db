<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Those men who have troubled the whole world. </em>This is the state of the gospel, to have those uproars which Satan raiseth imputeth to it. This is also the malicousness of the enemies of Christ, to lay the blame of tumults upon holy and modest teachers, which they themselves procure. Assuredly, the gospel is not preached to this end that it may set men together by the ears;<span class="cite-ref">(255)</span> but rather that it may keep them in peace, being reconciled to God. When Christ doth meekly will us<span class="cite-ref">(256)</span> there to come unto him, Satan and the wicked rage;<span class="cite-ref">(257)</span> therefore, Paul and Silas might easily have defended themselves; but it was requisite for them to suffer this false slander for a time; and so long as they were not heard, to put it up quietly. And the Lord meant by their example to teach us, that we must not give place to slanders and false reports; but we must stand stoutly in maintaining the truth, being ready to hear evil for things done well. Wherefore, away with the perverse wisdom of some, who, to the end they may escape false slanders, cease [hesitate] not to betray Christ and his gospel through their treacherous moderation, as though their good name were more precious than Paul’s and such like, yea, than the sacred name of God, which is not free from blasphemies.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(255)</span></p><p>“ Ut homines ad mutuous conflictus accendat,” that it may inflame men to mutual conflict. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(256)</span></p><p>“ Ad se benigne invitet,” benignity invite us to himself. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(257)</span></p><p>“ Tumultuanture,” make a tumult. </p></div></div>
