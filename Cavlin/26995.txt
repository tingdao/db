<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>46.</strong><em>Continuing in the temple </em>We must note that they did frequent the temple for this cause, because there was more opportunity and occasion offered there to further the gospel. Neither were they drawn with the holiness of the place, seeing they knew that the shadows of the law were ceased; neither meant they to draw others by their example to have the temple in any such reverence; <span class="cite-ref">(154)</span> but because there was there great concourse of people, who having laid aside their private cares, wherewith they had been drawn away elsewhere, <span class="cite-ref">(155)</span> did seek the Lord; they were continually in the temple, that they might gain such unto Christ. There might be another reason which might induce them hereunto, that they might have a mutual conference and imparting of doctrine amongst themselves, which they could not have done so conveniently in a private house, especially seeing they were so, many. </p><p><em>Breaking bread from house to house. </em>Luke signifieth unto us, that they did not only show some token of true godliness publicly, but that the course and tenor of their private life was alone in that respect. For whereas some do think that in this place, by breaking of bread is meant the Holy Supper, it seemeth to me that Luke meant no such thing. He signifieth, therefore, unto us, that they used to eat together, and that thriftily. <span class="cite-ref">(156)</span> For those which make sumptuous banquets do not eat their meat together so familiarly. Again, Luke addeth, <em>in singleness of heart; </em>which is also a token of temperance. In sum, his meaning is to declare, that their manner of living was brotherly and sober. Some do join simplicity and gladness with the praise of God; and both texts may well be allowed. <span class="cite-ref">(157)</span> But because there can be no singleness of heart in praising God, unless the stone be also in all parts of the life, therefore it is certain, that there is mention made thereof in this sense, that the faithful did always use the same in all places. <span class="cite-ref">(158)</span> And we must also note the circumstance of time, that, being environed and beset with many dangers, they were merry and joyful. The knowledge of God’s love toward us, and the hope of his protection, do bring us this goodness with them, that we praise God with quiet minds, whatsoever the world doth threaten. And as Luke spoke a little before of the public estate of the Church, so he declareth now what form and manner of life the faithful did use; that we may learn by their example a thrifty fellowship in our manner of living, and in all our whole life to embrace singleness, to enjoy the spiritual joy, and to exercise ourselves in the praises of God. Furthermore, the singleness of heart reacheth far; but if you join it in this place with breaking of bread, it shall signify as much as sincere love, where one man dealeth plainly with another, neither doth any man craftily hunt after his own profit. Yet had I rather set the same against that carefulness, wherewith worldly men <span class="cite-ref">(159)</span> do too much torment themselves. For when as we do not cast our care upon the Lord, this reward hangeth over our heads, that we tremble and quake even when we take our rest. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(154)</span> “Ad templi cultum,” to worship the temple. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(155)</span> “Quibus alibi magis distracti fuissent,” with which elsewhere they might have been more distracted. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(156)</span> “Frugaliter,” frugally. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(157)</span> “Et probabilis est uterque contextus,” and the context makes this probable. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(158)</span> “Eam ubique coluerunt,” did cultivate it everywhere. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(159)</span> “Providi homines,” the provident, or over careful. </p></div></div>
