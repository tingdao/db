Not a whit more admissible is the allegory which certain persons have contrived about the <em>ass </em>and the <em>colt </em>“The <em>she-ass,” </em>they tell us, “is a figure of the Jewish nation, which had been long subdued, and accustomed to the yoke of the Law. The Gentiles, again, are represented by <em>the colt, on which no man ever sat. </em>Christ sat first on the <em>ass </em>for this reason, that it was proper for him to begin with the Jews; and afterwards he passed over to the <em>colt</em>, because he was appointed to govern the Gentiles also in the second place.” And indeed Matthew appears to say that he rode on both of them; but as instances of <em>Synecdoche </em>occur frequently in Scripture, we need not wonder if he mentions two instead of one. From the other Evangelists it appears manifestly that the <em>colt </em>only was used by Christ; and all doubt is removed by Zechariah, (<span class="bvs">Zec_9:9</span>,)who twice repeats the same thing, according to the ordinary custom of the Hebrew language. <span class="cite-ref">(716)</span></p><p><em>And immediately you will find </em>That the disciples may feel no hesitation about immediate compliance, our Lord anticipates and replies to their questions. First, he explains that he does not send them away at random, and this he does by saying that, at the very entrance into the village, they will find an <em>ass-colt with its mother; </em>and, secondly, that nobody will hinder them from leading him away, if they only reply that He <em>hath need of him </em>In this way he proved his Divinity; for both to know absent matters, and to bend the hearts of men to compliance, <span class="cite-ref">(717)</span> belonged to God alone. It was, no doubt, possible that the owner of the ass, entertaining no unfavorable opinion of Christ, would cheerfully grant it; but to foresee if he would be at home, if it would then be convenient for him, or if he would place confidence in unknown persons, was not in the power of a mortal man. Again, as Christ strengthens the disciples, that they may be more ready to obey, so we see how they, on the other hand, yield submission. The result shows that the whole of this affair was directed by God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(714)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car il y avoit si pen de la iusques en Ierusalem, qu’il y fust aisee-merit alle a pied</span>;” — “for it was so short a distance from that place to Jerusalem, that he would easily have gone thither on foot.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(715)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin qu’on ne pensast point qu’il prinst cela a desplaisir, et qu’on lui attribuast l’honneur de Roy contre son vouloir</span>;” — “that it might not be thought that he took offense at this, and that the honor of King was given to him in opposition to his will.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(716)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car voyla ses mots, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Estant monte sur an asne</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">et sur un asnon poullain d’asnesse </em><em>; </em>” — “for his words are these, <em>Sitting on an ass</em>, <em>and on an ass-colt</em>, <em>the foal of an ass</em>. <em>” </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(717)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et de faire flechir les coeurs des hommes, pour accorder ce qu’il luy plaist</span>;” — “and to bend the hearts of men to grant what he pleases.” </p></div></div>
