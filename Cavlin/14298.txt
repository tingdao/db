<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Give me not up to the desire of mine oppressors. </em>The Hebrew noun <span class="lang he-il">נפש</span>, <em>nephesh, </em>signifies <em>lust, will, </em>or <em>desire; </em>and the language of David implies, Deliver me not up to the pleasure or lust of mine enemies, and thus he intimates, that they greedily gaped for his destruction. God delivers his people in two ways; either by appeasing the cruelty of the wicked, and rendering them meek; or, if he permit them to burn with fury, by restraining their power and violence, so that they desire and endeavor in vain to do mischief. The Psalmist afterwards adds, that he is persecuted both with slanders and false accusations, and also by open violence; for when he says, that they <em>bring forth violence, </em><span class="cite-ref">(589)</span> he means that they speak of nothing but of war and slaughter. We thus see that the holy man was miserably oppressed on every side. Even his integrity, which we know to have been singular, could not free him from bitter and deadly calumnies, and he was at the same time overwhelmed by the violence and force of his enemies. If the ungodly, therefore, should at any time rise against us, not only with menaces and cruel violence, but to give the semblance of justice to their enmity, should slander us with lies, let us remember the example of David, who was assaulted in both ways; nay, let us recall to mind that Christ the Son of God suffered no less injury from lying tongues than from violence. <span class="cite-ref">(590)</span> Moreover, this prayer was dictated for our comfort, to intimate that God can maintain our innocence, and oppose the shield of his protection to the cruelty of our enemies. </p><p><strong>(589)</strong><em>Hammond </em>renders the words “breathers or <em>speakers of injury </em>or <em>rapine; </em><span class="lang he-il">חמס</span>, signifying <em>injury </em>or <em>rapine, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">פוח</span>, <em>speak.” Ainsworth </em>reads, “He that breatheth or puffeth out violent wrong. </p><p><strong>(590)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De glaives et autre tels efforts</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “From the sword and other such weapons.” </p></div>
