<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And Stephen </em>Luke reciteth in this place a new combat of the Church, whereby it appeareth that the glory of the gospel was always joined with the cross and divers troubles. And this is the sum, that the Church was assaulted in the person of one man. Whereby it came to pass that the enemies were the more bold, and being imbrued with innocent blood, did rage sorer than they had wont; for they had not gone as yet beyond the prison and rods. But to the end we may know that the name of Christ was glorified as well in the life as in the death of Stephen, Luke saith at the first, that he was<em>full of faith and power. </em>Whereby he signifieth that his faith was excellent, and that he excelled in power to do miracles. Neither ought we to imagine perfection of faith, because he is said to be full of faith; but this manner of speaking is much used in the Scripture, to call those full of the gifts of God who are abundantly endued with the same. I take<em>power </em>(without question) for ability to do miracles. <em>Faith </em>comprehendeth not only the gift of understanding, but also the ferventness of zeal. Forasmuch as his name was famous by reason of his excellency, it came thereby to pass that the rage of the wicked was bent against him, as it were, with one consent, to overthrow him. <span class="cite-ref">(354)</span> For so soon as the force and grace of the Spirit doth show itself, the fury of Satan is by and by provoked. </p><p>And it shall appear by the text that Stephen was diligent and courageous in spreading abroad the doctrine of the gospel; but Luke passeth over that, being content to have commended his faith, which could not be slothful and sluggish. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(354)</span> “Uno quasi impetu in eum versa fuerit,” was, as it were, with one impulse directed against him. </p></div></div>
