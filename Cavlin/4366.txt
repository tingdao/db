<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Num_21:25</span><em>And Israel took all these cities. </em>As if speaking of something present, he uses the demonstrative pronoun, and says, “these cities,” just as if he were pointing them out to the eyes of his readers. The word which we have rendered “towns” <em>(oppida,) </em><span class="cite-ref">(130)</span> others translate “country-houses” <em>(villas,) </em>or “hamlets” <em>(viculos.) </em>In the Hebrew, Moses calls by the name of “daughters” all the villages and lesser towns, whose mother-city <em>(metropolis) </em>was Heshbon. By these words, however, Moses indicates that, by the right of war, all these places had fallen into the hands of the Israelites, as the lot of their inheritance; for, as I have lately said, God had not yet openly declared that they should be masters of this part of the country. They would consequently have over-passed their boundaries, unless these had been added to the land of Canaan. This is the reason why God openly declares that they possessed them by His authority. But when he says that the cities were destroyed, and all their inhabitants exterminated, so that neither women nor children were spared, let us understand that they dealt not thus cruelly of their own impulse, or in heedless violence, but that whatsoever was on the other side of Jordan was devoted to destruction by God, that they might always have their minds fixed on the promised land, and might never give way to listlessness, which would have been the case if an easy occupation of it had invited them to repose. Although, therefore, God delivered over the land to them hereafter, and suffered them to enrich themselves with its booty and spoils, yet He would not have it retained as a place of residence, and therefore commanded them to destroy its cities and villages, in order that they might seek their rest elsewhere. In fine, since they were abundantly disposed to be slothful, it was expedient that all snares should be removed, and that by the very desolation they might be urged forward whither God called them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(130)</span> “ ]Par ce mot, que nous avons translate <em>villages, </em>il nous faut aussi entendre les bourgades, et metairies;“ by this word, which we have translated <em>villages, </em>we must also understand the hamlets and farm-houses. — <em>Fr. </em>See marg.<em>A.V. </em></p></div></div>
