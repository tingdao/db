<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Before your pots can feel the fire of your thorns. </em>Some obscurity attaches to this verse, arising partly from the perplexed construction, and partly from the words being susceptible of a double meaning. <span class="cite-ref">(357)</span> Thus the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">סירות</span>,<em>siroth, </em>signifies either<em>a pot </em>or <em>a thorn. </em>If we adopt the first signification, we must read, <em>before your pots feel the fire which has been kindled by thorns; </em>if the second, <em>before your thorns grow to a bush, </em>that is, reach their full height and thickness. What, following the former sense, we have translated <em>flesh yet raw, </em>must be rendered, provided we adopt the other, <em>tender, or not yet grown. </em>But the scope of the Psalmist in the passage is sufficiently obvious. He refers to the swiftness of that judgment which God would execute upon his enemies, and prays that he would carry them away as by a whirlwind, either before they arrived at the full growth of their strength, like the thorn sprung to the vigorous plant, or before they came to maturity and readiness, like flesh which has been boiled in the pot. The latter meaning would seem to be the one of which the passage is most easily susceptible, that God, in the whirlwind of his anger, would carry away the wicked like flesh not yet boiled, which may be said scarcely to have felt the heat of the fire. </p><p><strong>(357)</strong> This verse has been deemed one of the most difficult passages in the Psalter, and has greatly perplexed commentators. Bishop Horsley reads — </p><p>“Before your pots feel the bramble,<LineBreak />In whirlwind and hurricane he shall sweep them away.” </p><p>He supposes that the language is proverbial, and that the Psalmist describes the sudden eruption of the divine wrath; sudden and violent as the ascension of the dry bramble underneath the housewife’s pot. Walford reads — </p><p>“Before your cooking vessels feel the fuel;<LineBreak />Both the green and the dry a whirlwind shall scatter.” </p><p>The passage is supposed by this author and others to contain an allusion to the manners of the Arabs, who, when they want to cook their food, collect bushes and brambles, both green and withered, with which they kindle a fire in the open air. But before their culinary vessels are sensibly afflicted with the heat, a whirlwind not unfrequently arises and scatters the fuel. And this strikingly expresses the sudden and premature destruction of the wicked. Fry gives a somewhat different explanation. He reads — </p><p>“Sooner than your vessels can feel the <em>blazing </em>thorn,<LineBreak />The hot blast shall consume them, as well the green as the dry.” </p><p>And he observes, that “<span class="lang he-il">שער</span>, or <span class="lang he-il">סער</span>, no doubt expresses the action of the hot wind of the desert.” This wind is eminently destructive, and has not unfrequently been known to entomb and destroy whole caravans. Sidi Hamet, describing his journey across the great desert to Tombuctoo with a caravan consisting of above one thousand men and four thousand camels, relates that, “after travelling upwards of a month they were attacked by the Shume, the burning blast of the desert, carrying with it clouds of sand. They were obliged to lie for two days with their faces on the ground, only lifting them occasionally to shake off the sand and obtain breath. Three hundred never rose again, and two hundred camels also perished.” — (<em>Murray </em>’<em>s Discoveries in Africa</em>, <em>volume </em>1, pp. 515, 516.) Estius gives this sense: “Before your thorns shall arrive to their full growth into a bush, the rage of a tempest shall snatch them away, as it were, in the flower of their age and growing to maturity.” The words <span class="lang he-il">כמו-חי</span>, <em>kemo-chai</em>, which Calvin renders <em>flesh yet raw</em>, are used in this sense in <span class="bvs">Lev_13:16</span>, and <span class="bvs">1Sa_11:15</span></p></div>
