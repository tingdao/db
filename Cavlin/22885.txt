<div class="comment-content"><p>He then immediately adds, <em>But my words and my statutes </em><span class="cite-ref">(15)</span><em>which I have committed to my Prophets, have they not laid hold on your fathers? </em>We have seen that he made a concession in the last verse; but here God expressly declares what I have stated — that though men vanish, or are hence removed after a short time, yet heavenly truth is ever firm, and retains its own power. But the Prophet uses another form of expression, <em>My words</em>, he says, <em>which I have committed to my servants, the Prophets, have they not laid on </em><span class="cite-ref">(16)</span><em>your father? </em>that is, “ought the remembrance of the punishment, by which I intended to teach you, and your children, and your grandchildren, that ye might not provoke my wrath as your fathers did, to be lost by you? Since the ye see the effect of my doctrine in your fathers, why do ye not consider, that as I am always the same, my words cannot possibly be in vain at the present day, or be without effect?” We now see how clearly the Prophet distinguishes between the word of God and the condition of men; for God does not declare what is empty, nor give utterance to words which produce no effect; but he executes whatever he has committed to his Prophets. </p><p>He then adds, <em>They returned and said, </em><span class="cite-ref">(17)</span><em>As Jehovah of hosts had purposed to do to us on account of our ways and our works, so he hath done</em>. Added here is a confession, which ought to have perpetually stimulated the Jews, while they saw that the obstinacy of their fathers had been subdued by the scourges of God. It is indeed true, that though they been sharply chastised, many of them did not yet really repent. God however extorted from them the confession that they were justly punished. Even the ungodly then had been constrained to give glory to God, and to confess that they were justly treated as guilty; but their children became immediately forgetful — was this a stupidity capable of being excused? He at the same time indirectly warns posterity that they might not imitate the negligence of their fathers, who would not have repented had they not been severely chastised; but that they might, on the contrary anticipate the judgment of God. We then see why the Prophet mentions that the Jews, who had been severely treated, freely confessed that they had been chastised by the hand of God; but we must notice the words. </p><p>He says, that the fathers had <em>returned</em>. Though their repentance was not sincere, yet God intimates that such was their punishment that it drew from them the confession that is here mentioned. What then could their posterity mean? or how could they become so audaciously mad against God, when they saw that their fathers and their obstinacy had been, as it were, broken down by the severe strokes by which God had smitten them? He then subjoins, <em>and said</em>, <em>As Jehovah hath prepared to do</em>. They confessed that they suffered evils not through chance, but that the purpose of God was thus fulfilled, which they had previously despised and almost derided. They further confessed, that they justly suffered; and they referred to their works and to their course of life. Since, then, the father had made this confession, who had hardened themselves long in their sins, their posterity were wholly without excuse in going on still to their own ruin, in containing impenitent, though warned by examples so memorable. This is the import of the passage. It now follows — </p><p><strong>(15)</strong> “Statuta mea,” [<span class="lang he-il">חקי</span> ]; “decreta,” <em>Dathius</em>; “decrees,” <em>Henderson</em>. The word means what is defined or appointed, as an order or a course, or a portion. It signifies here the portion defined and allotted to the Jews, the judgments denounced on them, which had been executed. They were God’s defined and allotted portions, what he had exactly described and defined by his Prophets. He says first, “my words,” a general term, and then, to express more distinctly what was intended, he adds, “my decrees,” or my appointments, or my allotted portions. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(16)</strong> “Overtake” is adopted by <em>Newcome </em>and <em>Henderson</em>; “supervenerunt “ — came upon,” <em>Grotius</em>. God’s judgments pursued and overtook them as a hunter his prey, or an enemy a flying enemy. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(17)</strong> “Adeo ut reversi dixerint — so that when they returned they said,” <em>Jun. </em>et <em>Trem., </em>and <em>Piscator</em>; “so that they turned and said,” <em>Henderson</em>. <em>Newcome </em>continues the question from the preceding line, “and did they <em>not </em>return and say?” The “return” here seems not to have been from a sinful course, but from exile. The confession was made by those who returned from Babylon. The sentence may be thus rendered, “when they returned, they said.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
