<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>47.</strong><em>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. </em>No new instruction is here given by Christ; but what he formerly taught is confirmed by another parable, that the Church of God, so long as it exists in the world, is a mixture of the good with the bad, and is never free from stains and pollutions. And yet the design of this parable is perhaps different. It may be that Christ intends not only to remove the offense which perplexes many weak minds, because they do not find in the world all the purity that might be desired, but likewise to employ the influence of fear and modesty, in restraining his disciples from delighting themselves with the empty title, or mere profession, of faith. For my own part, I cheerfully adopt both views. Christ informs us, that a mixture of the good and the bad must be patiently endured till <em>the end of the word; </em>because, till that time, a true and perfect restoration of the Church will not take place. Again, he warns us, that it is not enough, and—what is more—that it is of little consequence to us, to be gathered into the fold, unless we are his true and chosen sheep. To this effect is the saying of Paul, </p><p>The Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one that calleth on the name of the Lord depart from iniquity, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Ti_2:19</span>.) </p><p>The preaching of the Gospel is justly compared to a <em>net </em>sunk beneath the water, to inform us that the present state of the Church is confused. </p><p>Our God is the God of order, and not of confusion, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_14:33</span>,) </p><p>and, therefore, recommends to us discipline; but he permits hypocrites to remain for a time among believers, till the last day, when he will bring his kingdom to a state of perfection. So far as lies in our power, let us endeavor to correct vices, and let us exercise severity in removing pollutions; but the Church will not be free from every spot and blemish, until Christ shall have <em>separated the sheep from the goats, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_25:32</span>.) </p></div>
