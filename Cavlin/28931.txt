<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>His bowels more abundantly. </em>As the <em>bowels </em>are the seat of the affections, the term is on that account employed to denote compassion, love, and every pious affection. <span class="cite-ref">(657)</span> He wished, however, to express emphatically the idea, that while Titus had loved the Corinthians previously, he had been, at that time, more vehemently stirred up to love them; and that, from the innermost affections of his heart. Now, by these words he insinuates Titus into the affections of the Corinthians, as it is of advantage that the servants of Christ should be loved, that they may have it in their power to do the more good. He at the same time encourages them to go on well, that they may render themselves beloved by all the good. </p><p><em>With fear and trembling. </em>By these two words he sometimes expresses simply <em>respect, </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_6:5</span>,) and this perhaps would not suit ill with this passage, though I should have no objection to view the <em>trembling </em>as mentioned particularly to mean, that, being conscious of having acted amiss, they were afraid to face him. It is true that even those, that are resolute in their iniquities, tremble at the sight of the judge, but voluntary trembling, that proceeds from ingenuous shame, is a sign of repentance. Whichever exposition you may choose, this passage teaches, what is a right reception for the ministers of Christ. Assuredly, it is not sumptuous banquets, it is not splendid apparel, it is not courteous and honorable salutations, it is not the plaudits of the multitude, that gratify the upright and faithful pastor. He experiences, on the other hand, an overflowing of delight, when the doctrine of salvation is received with reverence from his mouth, when he retains the authority that belongs to him for the edification of the Church, when the people give themselves up to his direction, to be regulated by his ministry under Christ’s banners. An example of this we see here in Titus. He at length, in the close, confirms again, what he had previously stated — that he had never been offended to such a degree, as altogether to distrust the Corinthians. </p><p><strong>(657)</strong> “The word <span class="lang el-gr">σπλάγχνα,</span> ” as is observed by <em>Barnes </em>in his Notes on <span class="bvs">2Co_6:12</span>, “commonly means in the Bible the tender affections. The Greek word properly denotes the <em>upper </em>viscera — the heart, the lungs, the liver. It is applied by Greek writers to denote those parts of victims which were eaten during or after the sacrifice. Hence it is applied to the <em>heart, </em>as the seat of the emotions and passions; and <em>especially </em>the tender affections — compassion, pity, love, etc. Our word <em>bowels </em>is applied usually to the <em>lower </em>viscera, and by no means expresses the idea of the word which is used in <em>Greek. </em>” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
