But when he has narrated how the two sons of Eliab had been destroyed with their company, he briefly adverts to the clemency of God towards the sons of Korah, in that He spared them. And surely this was no common exercise of mercy not only to preserve them uninjured from the calamity, but afterwards to raise up shoots from the accursed root, in whom His spiritual riches might shine forth for the general advantage of the Church: for we know what honorable mention is often made of this family; and it is probable that certain of them were the authors of some of the Psalms, and thus were endued with the Spirit of prophecy, when possibly at that time none of the priests was possessed of this gift. This is that profound abyss in the various and unequal judgments of God, which it becomes us to adore with sober humility. Meanwhile, in a single word, Moses hints at the reason why he repeats this same history, whereby the formidable mode of their death might be held up as a perpetual example: for the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">נס</span>, <em>nes, </em>which is primarily a standard <span class="cite-ref">(193)</span> or banner, is often used for some portentous thing, which strikes men’s senses with astonishment, and at the same time fills their minds with fear. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(193)</span> “Un mot Hebrieu qui signifie tant banniere, que mas de navire, ou une haute perche;” a Hebrew word which signifies a banner, as well as the mast of a ship, or a high pole. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
