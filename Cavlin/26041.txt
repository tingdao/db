<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>49.</strong><em>And, lo, I send. </em>That the apostles may not be terrified by their weakness, he invites them to expect new and extraordinary grace; as if he had said, though you feel yourselves to be unfit for such a charge, there is no reason why you should despond, because I will send you from heaven that power which I know that you do not possess. The more fully to confirm them in this confidence, he mentions that <em>the Father had promised to them the Holy Spirit; </em>for, in order that they might prepare themselves with greater alacrity for the work, God had already encouraged them by his <em>promise, </em>as a remedy for their distrust. Christ now puts himself in the place of the Father, and undertakes to perform the promise; in which he again claims for himself divine power. To invest feeble men with heavenly power, is a part of that <em>glory </em>which God swears that <em>he will not give to another: </em>and, therefore, if it belongs to Christ, it follows that he is that God who formerly spoke by the mouth of the prophet, (<span class="bvs">Isa_42:8</span>.) And though God promised special grace to the apostles, and Christ bestowed it on them, we ought to hold universally that no mortal is of himself qualified for preaching the gospel, except so far as God clothes him with his Spirit, to supply his nakedness and poverty. And certainly, as it is not in reference to the apostles alone that Paul exclaims, </p><p>(<span class="bvs">2Co_2:16</span>,) <LineBreak />And who shall be found sufficient for these things? </p><p>so all whom God raises up to be ministers of the gospel must be endued with the heavenly Spirit; and, therefore, in every part of Scripture he is promised to all the teachers of the Church without exception. </p><p><em>But remain you in the city of Jerusalem. </em>That they may not advance to teach before the proper time, Christ enjoins on them silence and repose, until, sending them out according to his pleasure, he may make a seasonable use of their labors. And this was a useful trial of their obedience, that, after having been endued with the understanding of the Scripture, and after having had the grace of the Spirit <em>breathed on them, </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_20:22</span>;) yet because the Lord had forbidden them to speak, they were silent as if they had been dumb. For we know that those who expect to gain applause and admiration from their hearers are very desirous to appear in public. Perhaps, too, by this delay, Christ intended to punish them for indolence, because they did not, in compliance with his injunction, set out immediately, on the same day, for Galilee. However that may be, we are taught by their example, that we ought to attempt nothing but as the Lord calls us to it; and, therefore, though they may possess some ability to teach in public, let men remain in silence and retirement, until the Lord lead them by the hand into the public assembly. When they are commanded to <em>remain at Jerusalem, </em>we must understand this to mean, after they had returned from Galilee. For, as we shortly afterwards learn from Matthew, though he gave them an opportunity of seeing him at Jerusalem, still he did not change his original intention <em>to go to Galilee, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_26:32</span>.) The meaning of the word, therefore, is, that after having given them injunctions at the appointed place, he wishes them to remain silent for a time, until he supplies them with new rigor. </p></div>
