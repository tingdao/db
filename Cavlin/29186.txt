<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>And they that are Christ’s</em>. He adds this, in order to show that all Christians have renounced the flesh, and therefore enjoy freedom. While he makes this statement, the apostle reminds the Galatians what true Christianity is, so far as relates to the life, and thus guards them against a false profession of Christianity. The word <em>crucified </em>is employed to point out that the mortification of the flesh is the effect of the cross of Christ. This work does not belong to man. By the grace of Christ </p><p>“we have been planted together in the likeness of his death” (<span class="bvs">Rom_6:5</span>,) </p><p>that we no longer might live unto ourselves. If we are buried with Christ, by true self-denial, and by the destruction of the old man, we shall then enjoy the privilege of the sons of God. The flesh is not yet indeed entirely destroyed; but it has no right to exercise dominion, and ought to yield to the Spirit. The <em>flesh </em>and its<em>lusts </em>are a figure of speech of exactly the same import with the <em>tree </em>and its <em>fruits</em>. The <em>flesh </em>itself is the depravity of corrupt nature, from which all evil actions proceed. (<span class="bvs">Mat_15:19</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_7:21</span>.) Hence it follows, that the members of Christ have cause to complain, if they are still held to be in bondage to the law, from which all who have been regenerated by his Spirit are set free. </p></div>
