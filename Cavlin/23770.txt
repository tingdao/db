<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Why then did Moses order? </em>They had thought of this calumny, <span class="cite-ref">(597)</span> if, which was more probable, Christ should demand a proper cause to be shown in cases of divorce; for it appears that whatever God permits by his law, whose will alone establishes the distinction between what is good or evil, is lawful. But Christ disarms the falsehood and slander by the appropriate reply, that Moses permitted it on account of their obstinacy, and not because he approved of it as lawful. And he confirms his opinion by the best argument, <em>because it was not so at the beginning. </em>He takes for granted that, when God at first instituted marriage, he established a perpetual law, which ought to remain in force till the end of the world. And if the institution of marriage is to be reckoned an inviolable law, it follows that whatever swerves from it does not arise from its pure nature, but from the depravity of men. </p><p>But it is asked, Ought Moses to have permitted what was in itself bad and sinful? I reply, That, in an unusual sense of the word, he is said to have<em>permitted </em>what he did not severely forbid; <span class="cite-ref">(598)</span> for he did not lay down a law about divorces, so as to give them the seal of his approbation, but as the wickedness of men could not be restrained in any other way, he applied what was the most admissible remedy, that the husband should, at least, attest the chastity of his wife. For the law was made solely for the protection of the women, that they might not suffer any disgrace after they had been unjustly rejected. Hence we infer, that it was rather a punishment inflicted on the husbands, than an indulgence or <em>permission </em>fitted to inflame their lust. Besides, political and outward order is widely different from spiritual government. What is lawful and proper the Lord has comprehended under the <em>ten words</em>. <span class="cite-ref">(599)</span> Now as it is possible that many things, for which every man’s conscience reproves and charges him, may not be called in question at a human tribunal, it is not wonderful if those things are connived at by political laws. </p><p>Let us take a familiar instance. The laws grant to us a greater liberty of litigation than the law of charity allows. Why is this? Because the right cannot be conferred on individuals, unless there be an open door for demanding it; and yet the inward law of God declares that we ought to follow what charity shall dictate. And yet there is no reason why magistrates should make this an excuse for their indolence, if they voluntarily abstain from correcting vices, or neglect what the nature of their office demands. But let men in a private station beware of doubling the criminality of the magistrates, by screening their own vices under the protection of the laws. For here the Lord indirectly reproves the Jews for not, reckoning it enough that their stubbornness was allowed to pass unpunished, if they did not implicate God as defending their iniquity. And if the rule of a holy and pious life is not always, or in all places, to be sought from political laws, much less ought we to seek it from custom. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(597)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils avoyent songe ceste calomnie pour l’avoir toute preste</span>;” — “they had thought of this calumny, to have it all ready.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(598)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ie repond, Qu’a parler proprement, il ne l’a pas permis: mais d’autant qu’il ne l’a pas defendu estroittement, il est dit qu’il l’a permis</span>;” — “I reply, That, strictly speaking, he did not <em>permit </em>it; but in so far as he did not strictly forbid it, he is said to have <em>permitted </em>it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(599)</span> Where the English version gives the words, <em>ten commandments</em>, the phrase in the original Hebrew is, <span class="lang he-il">עשרת הדברים</span>, <em>the ten words</em>, ( <span class="bvs">Exo_34:28</span>; <span class="bvs">Deu_4:13</span>.) — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
