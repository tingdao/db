<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>O man of little faith. </em>While our Lord kindly preserves Peter, he does not connive at Peter’s fault. Such is the object of the chastisement administered, when Peter is blamed for the weakness of his faith. But a question arises, Does every kind of fear give evidence of a weakness of faith? for Christ’s words seem to imply that, where faith reigns, there is no room for doubt. <span class="cite-ref">(384)</span> I reply: Christ reproves here that kind of doubt which was directly opposed to faith. A man may sometimes doubt without any fault on his part; and that is, when the word of the Lord does not speak with certainty on the matter. But the case was quite different with Peter, who had received an express command from Christ, and had already experienced his power, and yet leaves that twofold support, and falls into foolish and wicked fear. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(384)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Doute et Crainte ne peuvent avoir lieu ou la foy regne</span>;” — “that Doubt and Fear cannot have place where faith reigns.” </p></div></div>
