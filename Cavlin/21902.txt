<div class="comment-content"><p>The exposition of the word Tekel, <em>to weigh, </em>now follows: â€” <em>Since thou hast been weighed in the balance, or scale, and found wanting </em>Here Daniel shews God so moderating his judgments, as if he was carrying a balance in his hand. The emblem is taken from the custom of mankind; for men know the use of the balance for accurate measurement. So also God is said to treat all things by weight and measure, since he does nothing with confusion, but uses moderation; and, according to ordinary language, nothing is more or less than it should be. (<span class="bvs">Wis_11:21</span>.) For this reason, Daniel says God <em>weighed Belshazzar in a balance, </em>since he did not make haste to inflict punishment, but exacted it with justice according to his own uniform rule of government. <em>Since he was found deficient, </em>that is, was found light and without weight. As if he had said, Thou thinkest thy dignity must be spared, since all men revere thee; thou thinkest thyself worthy of honor; thou art deceived says he, for God judges otherwise; God does not use a common scale, but holds his own, <em>and there art found deficient; </em>that is, thou art found a man of no <em>consequence, </em>in any way. From these words there is no doubt that the tyrant was greatly exasperated, but as his last end was approaching, he ought to hear the voice of the herald. And God, without doubt, restrained his fierceness, that he should not rise up against Daniel. </p></div>
