<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet now concludes his subjects which was, that as God executed judgments so severe on the people, it was a wonder that they remained stupefied, when thus reduces to extremities. <em>The vine</em>, he says, <em>has dried up</em>, and every kind of fruit; he adds the <em>fig-tree, </em>afterwards the <span class="lang he-il">רמון</span><em>remun</em>, the <em>pomegranate</em>, (for so they render it,) <em>the palm, the apple-tree</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(4)</span> and all trees. And this sterility was a clear sign of God’s wrath; and it would have been so regarded, had not men either wholly deceived themselves, or had become hardened against all punishments. Now this <span class="lang el-gr">αναὶσθησὶα</span> (<em>insensibility</em>) is as it were the very summit of evils; that is, when men feel not their own calamities, or at least understand not that they are inflicted by the hand of God. Let us now proceed — </p><p><strong>(4)</strong> Of the three foregoing trees we may add this account: <LineBreak />The pomegranate, <span class="lang he-il">רמון</span>, grows about 20 feet high, has a straight stem and spreading branches, and bears large red blossoms. Its fruit is about the size of an orange, and is delicious and cooling. <LineBreak />The palm or date-tree, <span class="lang he-il">תמר</span>, is sometimes as high as 100 feet, and remarkably straight. Its fruit grows in clusters under its leaves, and is in taste very sweet. Palm branches were emblems of victory. <LineBreak />What is called here the apple-tree, <span class="lang he-il">תפוח</span>, was no doubt the citron-tree. The word is derived from <span class="lang he-il">נפה</span>, to breathe, on account of the extreme fragrance it emits. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
