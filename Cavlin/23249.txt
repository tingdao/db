<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_5:14</span><em>Ye are the light of the world </em>We are all the children of light, after having been enlightened by faith, and are commanded to carry in our hands “burning lamps,” (that we may not wander in darkness,) and even to point out to others the way of life, (<span class="bvs">Luk_12:35</span>.) But, as the preaching of the Gospel was committed to the apostles above others, and is now committed to the pastors of the Church, this designation is given to them, in a peculiar manner, by Christ. “They are placed in this rank on the condition, that they shall shine, as from an elevated situation, on all others.” </p><p>He subjoins two comparisons. <em>A city placed on a mountain cannot be concealed; </em>and <em>a candle, </em>when it has been lighted, is <em>not usually concealed, </em>(verse 15.) This means, that they ought to live in such a manner, as if the eyes of all were upon them. <span class="cite-ref">(380)</span> And certainly, the more eminent a person is, the more injury he does by a bad example, if he acts improperly. Christ, therefore, informs the apostles, that they must be more careful to live a devout and holy life, than unknown persons of the common rank, because the eyes of all are directed to them, as to lighted <em>candles; </em>and that they must not be endured, if their devotion, and uprightness of conduct, do not correspond to the doctrine of which they are ministers. Mark and Luke appear to apply the comparison in a different manner: for there Christ gives a general admonition, that they ought to take particular care, lest any one, trusting to the darkness, indulge freely in sin, because what is hidden for a time will afterwards be revealed. But perhaps the discourses related by both of them are detached from the immediate context. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(380)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme si tout le monde les regardoit</span>;” — “as if every body were looking at them.” </p></div></div>
