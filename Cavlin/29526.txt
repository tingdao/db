<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Lie not</em>. When he forbids <em>lying</em>, he condemns every sort of cunning, and all base artifices of deception. For I do not understand the term as referring merely to calumnies, but I view it as contrasted in a general way with sincerity. Hence it might be allowable to render it more briefly, and I am not sure but that it might also be a better rendering, thus: <em>Lie not one to another</em>. He follows out, however, his argument as to the fellowship, which believers have in the death and resurrection of Christ, but employs other forms of expression. </p><p>The <em>old man </em>denotes — whatever we bring from our mother’s womb, and whatever we are by nature. <span class="cite-ref">(438)</span> It is <em>put off </em>by all that are renewed by Christ. The <em>new man</em>, on the other hand, is that which is renewed by the Spirit of Christ to the obedience of righteousness, or it is nature restored to its true integrity by the same Spirit. The <em>old man</em>, however, comes first in order, because we are first born from Adam, and afterwards are born again through Christ. And as what we have from Adam becomes old, <span class="cite-ref">(439)</span> and tends towards ruin, so what we obtain through Christ remains for ever, and is not frail; but, on the contrary, tends towards immortality. This passage is worthy of notice, inasmuch as a definition of regeneration may be gathered from it. For it contains two parts — the <em>putting off </em>of the <em>old man</em>, and the <em>putting on </em>of the <em>new</em>, and of these Paul here makes mention. It is also to be noticed, that the <em>old man </em>is distinguished by his works, as a tree is by its fruits. Hence it follows, that the depravity that is innate in us is denoted by the term <em>old man </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(438)</span> See Calvin on the Romans, p. 224; also Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 188. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(439)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Deuient vieil et caduque</span>;” — “Becomes old and frail.” </p></div></div>
