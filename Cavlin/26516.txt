Hence we infer that empires did not spring up at random, nor by the mistakes of men, but that they were appointed by the will of God, because he wishes that political order should exist among men, and that we should be governed by usages and laws. For this reason Paul says, that all who </p><p>resist the power are rebels against God, because there is no power but what is ordained by God, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_13:1</span>.) </p><p>It will, perhaps, be objected, that other callings also are from God, and are approved by him, and yet that we do not, on that account, call farmers, or cowherds, or cobblers, <em>gods </em>I reply, this is not a general declaration, that all who have been called by God to any particular way of living are called <em>gods</em>; but Christ speaks of kings, whom God has raised to a more elevated station, that they may rule and govern. In short, let us know that magistrates are called <em>gods</em>, because God has given them authority. Under the term <em>Law, </em>Christ includes the whole doctrine by which God governed his ancient Church; for since the prophets were only expounders of the Law, the Psalms are justly regarded as an appendage to the Law. That <em>the Scripture cannot be broken </em>means, that the doctrine of Scripture is inviolable. </p></div>
