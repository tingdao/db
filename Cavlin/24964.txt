<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>70.</strong><em>As he spake </em>That the salvation which is said to have been brought by Christ may not be thought doubtful on the score of novelty, he adduces as witnesses all the <em>Prophets, </em>who, though they were raised up at different times, yet with one consent teach, that salvation is to be expected from Christ alone. Nor was it the sole design of Zacharias to celebrate the truth and faithfulness of God, in performing and fulfilling what he formerly promised. His object rather was to draw the attention of believers to the ancient predictions, that they might embrace, with greater certainty and cheerfulness, the salvation offered to them, of which the Prophets from the beginning had testified. When Christ comes forth adorned, <span class="cite-ref">(73)</span> with the testimonies of all the Prophets, our faith in him rests on a truly solid foundation. </p><p>He calls them <em>holy prophets, </em>to secure for their words greater authority and reverence. They were not inconsiderable or ordinary witnesses, but were of the first rank, <span class="cite-ref">(74)</span> and furnished with a public commission, having been separated from the common people, for that purpose, by divine authority. To inquire minutely how each of the prophets gave testimony to Christ, would lead us into a long dissertation. Let it suffice for the present to say, that they all uniformly make the hope of the people, that God would be gracious to them, to rest entirely on that covenant between God and them which was founded on Christ, and thus speak plainly enough of the future redemption, which was manifested in Christ. To this purpose are many striking passages, which contain no dark prophecies respecting Christ, but point him out, as it were, with the finger. But our chief attention is due to the signature of the divine covenant; for he that neglects this will never understand any thing in the prophets: as the Jews wander wretchedly <span class="cite-ref">(75)</span> in reading the Scripture, in consequence of giving their whole study to words, and wandering from the main design. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(73)</span> “Ornatus;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">revestu et garni d'excellens tesmoignages de tous les Prophetes</span>;” — “clothed and adorned with excellent testimonies of all the Prophets.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(74)</span> “Classicos testes.” This is a fine allusion to the Roman division into <em>classes, </em>(mentioned by Livy, 1:43,) from the first of which classes, as carrying greater weight and respectability, “testes,” <em>witnesses </em>were selected for signing Testaments, — a department of Conveyancing, which all civilized nations have guarded by the most careful provisions, and in which authenticity is peculiarly and indispensably necessary. Calvin's vernacular brings out, though with less elegance, the meaning in which <em>classicos testes </em> is here used, — “<span class="lang fr-fr">bons, suffisans, et sans reproche</span>;” — “good, sufficient, and without reproach.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(75)</span> “Misere vagantur.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les Juifs ne font que tracasser et se tormenter sans profit toute leur vie</span>;” — “the Jews do but vex and tease themselves without advantage all their life.” </p></div></div>
