<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>Who hath also given</em>. That he may the more effectually turn away the Thessalonians from such contempt and obstinacy, he reminds them that they had been endowed with the Spirit of God, <em>first</em>, in order that they may distinguish what proceeds from God; <em>secondly</em>, that they make such a difference as is befitting between holiness and impurity; and <em>thirdly</em>, that, with heavenly authority, they may pronounce judgment against all manner of unchastity — such as will fall upon their own heads, unless they keep aloof from contagion. Hence, however wicked men may treat with ridicule all instructions that are given as to a holy life and the fear of God, those that are endowed with the Spirit of God have a very different testimony sealed upon their hearts. We must therefore take heed, lest we should extinguish or obliterate it. At the same time, this may refer to Paul and the other teachers, as though he had said, that it is not from human perception that they condemn unchastity, but they pronounce from the authority of God what has been suggested to them by his Spirit. I am inclined, however, to include both. Some manuscripts have the second person — <em>you</em>, which restricts the gift of the Spirit to the Thessalonians. </p></div>
