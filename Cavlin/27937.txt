<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>To all of you who are at Rome, etc. </em>By this happy arrangement he sets forth what there is in us worthy of commendation; he says, that first the Lord through his own kindness made us the objects of his favor and love; and then that he has called us; and thirdly, that he has called us to holiness: but this high honor only then exists, when we are not wanting to our call. </p><p>Here a rich truth presents itself to us, to which I shall briefly refer, and leave it to be meditated upon by each individual: Paul does by no means ascribe the praise of our salvation to ourselves, but derives it altogether from the fountain of God’s free and paternal love towards us; for he makes this the first thing — God loves us: and what is the cause of his love, except his own goodness alone? On this depends our calling, by which in his own time he seals his adoption to those whom he had before freely chosen. We also learn from this passage that none rightly connect themselves with the number of the faithful, except they feel assured that the Lord is gracious, however unworthy and wretched sinners they may be, and except they be stimulated by his goodness and aspire to holiness, for he hath not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness. (<span class="bvs">1Th_4:7</span>.) As the Greek can be rendered in the second person, I see no reason for any change. </p><p><em>Grace to you and peace, etc. </em>Nothing is more desirable than to have God propitious to us, and this is signified by <em>grace</em>; and then to have prosperity and success in all things flowing from him, and this is intimated by <em>peace</em>; for however things may seem to smile on us, if God be angry, even blessing itself is turned to a curse. The very foundation then of our felicity is the favor of God, by which we enjoy true and solid prosperity, and by which also our salvation is promoted even when we are in adversities. <span class="cite-ref">(25)</span> And then as he prays to God for peace, we must understand, that whatever good comes to us, it is the fruit of divine benevolence. Nor must we omit to notice, that he prays at the same time to the Lord Jesus Christ for these blessings. Worthily indeed is this honor rendered to him, who is not only the administrator and dispenser of his Father’s bounty to us, but also works all things in connection with him. It was, however, the special object of the Apostle to show, that through him all God’s blessings come to us. <span class="cite-ref">(26)</span></p><p>There are those who prefer to regard the word <em>peace </em>as signifying quietness of conscience; and that this meaning belongs to it sometimes, I do not deny: but since it is certain that the Apostle wished to give us here a summary of God’s blessings, the former meaning, which is adduced by <em>Bucer</em>, is much the most suitable. Anxiously wishing then to the godly what makes up real happiness, he betakes himself, as he did before, to the very fountain itself, even the favor of God, which not only alone brings to us eternal felicity but is also the source of all blessings in this life. </p><p><strong>(25)</strong> “The ancient Greeks and Romans,” says [<span class="bvs">Turrettin </span>], “wished to those to whom they wrote, in the inscription of their epistles, health, joy, happiness; but Paul prays for far higher blessings even the <em>favor </em>of God, the fountain of all good things, and <em>peace</em>, in which the Hebrews included all blessings.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(26)</strong> “<em>From God our Father, </em>— if God, then able; if our Father, then willing to enrich us with his gifts: <em>and from our Lord Jesus Christ, </em>— from our Lord, who has purchased them for us; from Jesus, for without these we cannot be saved; from Christ, for he is anointed with grace and peace, <span class="bvs">Joh_1:16</span>.” — [<span class="bvs">Parr </span>] </p></div>
