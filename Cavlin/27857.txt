<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>And there continued with us. </em>Luke seemeth so to commend one man’s constancy, that he nippeth the rest. For there were more which did accompany him to Jerusalem; whereof we see two only which remained with him. But because it may be that the rest were letted with some just causes, or that Paul refused to have them to minister unto him, I will say nothing either way. Neither is it an unmeet thing to say<span class="cite-ref">(634)</span> that Luke had some special reason for which he doth commend this man above the rest, albeit he was but one of many. Surely, it is likely that he was a rich man, seeing he was able to bear the charges whereat he was by the space of three years, having left his house. For we heard before ( <span class="bvs">Act_17:11</span>) that many of the chief families in Thessalonica did receive Christ, and Luke saith, for honor’s sake, that Aristarchus and Secundus came with Paul into Asia ( <span class="bvs">Act_20:4</span>). Therefore, let it suffice us to hold that which is certain and good to be known, that there is set before us an example of holy patience, because Aristarchus is not wearied with any trouble, but doth willingly take part with Paul in his trouble,<span class="cite-ref">(635)</span> and after that he had been in prison with him two years, he doth now cross the seas, that he may likewise minister to him at Rome, not without the reproachings of many, besides the loss of his goods at home, and so great charges.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(634)</span></p><p>“ Nec vero absurdum est,” and there is no absurdity in supposing. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(635)</span></p><p>“ Sponte eandem cum Paulo fortunam subeat,” spontaneously shares in Paul's fortunes. </p></div></div>
