<div class="comment-content"><p>He at length explains more clearly, in other words, the same thing, on <em>account of your incense, </em>he says, <em>and because ye have done wickedly, </em>etc. By naming incense especially, stating a part for the whole, he refers to all false and corrupt modes of worship, as it was stated yesterday; but he declares all of them to have been abominable. Then he says, <em>Ye have acted impiously against God </em>He now exaggerates their sin, for they had despised all godly admonitions, <em>ye have not hearkened, </em>he says, <em>to the voice of Jehovah </em>I apply this to the discourses of the Prophets, by which God continued to exhort them to repentance; for he daily and constantly addressed them, in order to restore them to the way of salvation. Then the Prophet condemns them, because they hearkened not to the words of the Prophets. </p><p>Then he adds, <em>Nor walked in his Law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies, he </em>shews by these words, that even if Prophets had not been sent, one after the other, the Law ought to have been sufficient for them. But he was not content with mentioning the Law only, but added, <em>statutes and testimonies: </em>by which words he intimates, as we said yesterday, that the doctrine of the Law was clear and plain. </p><p>he at length adds, <em>Therefore has all this evil happened to you, as it appears at this day. </em>The Prophet, in short, intimates that their guilt was sufficiently proved, because God had been so angry with them, and they had been so severely afflicted; for if his judgments are right, it follows that the punishment he inflicted on the Jews was right. It may also be hence inferred, that they had been rebellious, because they had perverted and corrupted his true worship. </p></div>
