<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And after that the days were fulfilled </em>On the fortieth day after the birth, (<span class="bvs">Lev_12:2</span>,) the rite of purification was necessary to be performed. But Mary and Joseph come to Jerusalem for another reason, to present Christ to the Lord, because he was the first-born. Let us now speak first of the purification. Luke makes it apply both to Mary and to Christ: for the pronoun <span class="lang el-gr">αὐτῶν</span>, of <em>them, </em>can have no reference whatever to Joseph. But it ought not to appear strange, that Christ, who was to be, made a curse for us on the cross,” (<span class="bvs">Gal_3:13</span>,) should, for our benefit, take upon him our uncleanness with respect to legal guilt, though he was “without blemish and without spot,” (<span class="bvs">1Pe_1:19</span>.) It ought not, I say, to appear strange, if the fountain of purity, in order to wash away our stains, chose to be reckoned unclean. <span class="cite-ref">(191)</span> It is a mistake to imagine that this law of purification was merely political, and that the woman was unclean in presence of her husband, not in presence of God. On the contrary, it placed before the eyes of the Jews both the corruption of their nature, and the remedy of divine grace. </p><p>This law is of itself abundantly sufficient to prove original sin, while it contains a striking proof of the grace of God; for there could not be a clearer demonstration of the curse pronounced on mankind than when the Lord declared, that the child comes from its mother unclean and polluted, and that the mother herself is consequently defiled by childbearing. Certainly, if man were not born a sinner, if he were not by nature a <em>child of wrath, </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_2:3</span>,) if some taint of sin did not dwell in him, he would have no need of purification. Hence it follows, that all are corrupted in Adam; for the mouth of the Lord charges all with pollution. </p><p>It is in perfect consistency with this, that the Jews are spoken of, in other passages, as “holy branches of a holy root,” (<span class="bvs">Rom_11:16</span> :) for this benefit did not properly belong to their own persons. They had been set apart, by the privilege of adoption, as an elect people; but the corruption, which they had by inheritance from Adam, was first in the order of time <span class="cite-ref">(192)</span> We must, therefore, distinguish between the first nature, and that special kindness through a covenant, by which God delivers his own people from the curse which had been pronounced on all. And the design of legal purification was to inform the Jews<em>, </em>that the pollutions, which they brought with them into the world at their birth, are washed away by the grace of God. </p><p>Hence too we ought to learn, how dreadful is the contagion of sin, which defiles, in some measure, the lawful order of nature. I do own that child-bearing is not unclean, and that what would otherwise be lust changes its character, through the sacredness of the marriage relation. But still the fountain of sin is so deep and abundant, that its constant overflowings stain what would otherwise be pure. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(191)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si celuy qui est la fontaine de toute purete, a voulu estre tenu pour immonde et souille, afin de laver toutes nos ordures</span>.” — “If he, who is the fountain of all purity, determined to be reckoned unclean and defiled in order to wash away our pollutions.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(192)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La corruption hereditaire procedante d'Adam precedoit un tel bien, et estoit plus ancienne</span>.” — “The hereditary corruption proceeding from Adam preceded such a benefit, and was more ancient.” </p></div></div>
