Walking in the flesh </em>means here — <em>living it the world; </em>or, as he expresses it elsewhere, </p><p>being at home in the body. (<span class="bvs">2Co_5:6</span>.) </p><p>For he was shut up in the prison of his body. This, however, did not prevent the influence of the Holy Spirit from showing itself marvelously in his weakness. There is here again a kind of concession, which, at the same time, is of no service to his adversaries. </p><p>Those <em>war according to the flesh, </em>who attempt nothing but in dependence upon worldly resources, in which alone, too, they glory. They have not their confidence placed in the government and guidance of the Holy Spirit. Paul declares that he is not one of this class, inasmuch as he is furnished with other weapons than those of the flesh and the world. Now, what he affirms respecting himself is applicable, also, to all true ministers of Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(754)</span> For they </p><p>carry an inestimable treasure in earthen vessels, </p><p>as he had previously said. (<span class="bvs">2Co_4:7</span>.) Hence, however they may be surrounded with the infirmities of the flesh, the spiritual power of God, nevertheless, shines forth resplendently in them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(754)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tous vrais seruiteurs et ministres de Jesus Christ</span>;” — “All true servants and ministers of Jesus Christ.” </p></div></div>
