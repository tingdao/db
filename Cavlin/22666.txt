<div class="comment-content"><p>The meaning of the first verse is somewhat doubtful: some refer what the Prophet says to punishment; and others to the wickedness of the people. The first think that the calamity, with which the Lord had visited the sins of the people, is bewailed; as though the Prophet looked on the disordered state of the whole land. But it may be easily gathered from the second verse, that the Prophet speaks here of the wickedness of the people, rather than of the punishment already inflicted. I have therefore put the two verses together, that the full meaning may be more evident to us. </p><p><em>Woe </em>then <em>to me! </em>Why? <em>I am become as gatherings </em>Too free, or rather too licentious is this version, — “I am become as one who seeks to gather summer-fruits, and finds none;” so that being disappointed of his hope, he burns with desire. This cannot possibly be considered as the rendering of the Prophet’s words. There is indeed some difficulty in the expressions: their import, however, seems to be this, — that the land, which the Prophet undertakes here to represent and personify, was like to a field, or a garden, or a vineyard, that was empty. He therefore says, that the land was stripped of all its fruit, as it is after harvest and the vintage. So by <em>gatherings </em>we must understand the collected fruit. Some understand the gleanings which remain, as when one leaves carelessly a few clusters on the vines: and thus, they say, a few just men remained alive on the land. But the former comparison harmonizes better with the rest of the passage, and that is, that the land was now stripped of all its fruit, as it is after the harvest and the vintage. <em>I am become </em>then <em>as the gatherings of summer, </em>that is, as in the summer, when the fruit has been already gathered; <em>and as the clusters of the vintage, </em>that is when the vintage is over. <span class="cite-ref">(181)</span></p><p><em>There is no cluster, he says to eat. </em>The Prophet refers here to the scarcity of good men; yea, he says that there were no longer any righteous men living. For though God had ever preserved some hidden seed, yet it might have been justly declared with regard to the whole people, that they were like a field after gathering the corn, or a vineyard after the vintage. Some residue, indeed, remains in the field after harvest, but there are no ears of corn; and in the vineyard some bunches remain, but they are empty; nothing remains but leaves. Now this personification is very forcible when the Prophet comes forth as though he represented the land itself; for he speaks in his own name and person, <em>Woe is to me, </em>he says, <em>for I am like summer-gatherings! </em>It was then the same thing, as though he deplored his own nakedness and want, inasmuch as there were not remaining any upright and righteous men. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(181)</span><em>Newcome </em>renders the verse somewhat different, and makes the comparison more clear, — </p><p><em>“Woe is me! For I am become </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>As the gatherers of late figs,</em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>As the gleaners of the vintage: </em><em><LineBreak /></em>There is<em>no cluster to eat; </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>My soul desireth the first ripe fig.” </em></p><p>Substantially the same is the version of <em>Dathius </em>and of <em>Henderson. </em>“Late figs” is not strictly the meaning of <span class="lang he-il">קיף</span>, which is properly summer or summer-fruit; yet, as the early or first ripe fig is mentioned in the last line, which forms a contrast with this, what is meant, no doubt, is the late figs. Then the word for “gleaners,” <span class="lang he-il">עללת</span>, is properly, gleanings; but here it is evidently to be taken as a concrete, gleaners, to correspond with gatherers, though <em>Newcome </em>considers the women-gleaners to be intended. The four last lines form a parallelism, in which the first and the early fig, — the vintage and the cluster. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
