He shews, accordingly, that it was by no unreasonable affection (as happens in the case of some) that he had been led to take upon himself so great a concern for the Colossians and others, but because the duty of his office required it. </p><p>The term <em>consolation </em>is taken here to denote that true quietness in which they may repose. This he declares they will at length come to enjoy in the event of their being <em>united in love </em>and faith. From this it appears where the chief good is, and in what things it consists — when mutually agreed in one faith, we are also joined together in mutual love. This, I say, is the solid joy of a pious mind — this is the blessed life. As, however, love is here commended from its effect, because it fills the mind of the pious with true joy; so, on the other hand, the cause of it is pointed out by him, when he says, in <em>all fullness of understanding. </em><span class="cite-ref">(346)</span> The bond also of holy unity is the truth of God, when we embrace it with one consent; for peace and agreement with men flow forth from that fountain. </p><p><em>Riches of the assurance of understanding. </em>As many, contenting themselves with a slight taste, have nothing but a confused and evanescent knowledge, he makes mention expressly of the <em>riches of understanding</em>. By this phrase he means full and clear perception; and at the same time admonishes them, that according to the measure of understanding they must make progress also in love. </p><p>In the term <em>assurance</em>, he distinguishes between faith and mere opinion; for <em>that </em>man truly knows the Lord who does not vacillate or waver in doubt, but stands fast in a firm and constant persuasion. This constancy and stability Paul frequently calls (<span class="lang el-gr">πληροφορίαν</span>) <em>full assurance</em>, (which term he makes use of here also,) and always connects it with faith, as undoubtedly it can no more be separated from it than heat or light can be from the sun. The doctrine, therefore, of the schoolmen is devilish, inasmuch as it takes away assurance, and substitutes in its place <em>moral conjecture</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(347)</span> as they term it. </p><p><em>Is an acknowledgment of the mystery. </em>This clause must be read as added by way of <em>apposition</em>, for he explains what that knowledge is, of which he has made mention — that it is nothing else than the knowledge of the gospel. For the false apostles themselves endeavor to set off their impostures under the title of wisdom, but Paul retains the sons of God within the limits of the gospel exclusively, that they may desire to <em>know nothing else</em>. (<span class="bvs">1Co_2:2</span>.) Why he uses the term <em>mystery </em>to denote the gospel, has been already explained. Let us, however, learn from this, that the gospel can be understood by faith alone — not by reason, nor by the perspicacity of the human understanding, because otherwise it is a thing that is hid from us. </p><p>The <em>mystery of God </em>I understand in a passive signification, as meaning — that in which God is revealed, for he immediately adds — <em>and of the Father, and of Christ </em>— by which expression he means that God cannot be known otherwise than <em>in Christ</em>, as, on the other hand, the Father must necessarily be known where Christ is known. For John affirms both: </p><p>He that hath the Son, hath the Father also: he that hath not the Son, hath also not the Father. (<span class="bvs">1Jo_2:23</span>.) </p><p>Hence all that think that they know anything of God apart from Christ, contrive to themselves an idol in the place of God; as also, on the other hand, that man is ignorant of Christ, who is not led by him to the Father, and who does not in him embrace God wholly. In the mean time, it is a memorable passage for proving Christ’s divinity, and the unity of his essence with the Father. For having spoken previously as to the knowledge of God, he immediately applies it to the Son, as well as to the Father, whence it follows, that the Son is God equally with the Father. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(346)</span> “<em class="lang fr-fr">En toutes richesses de certitude d’intelligence </em>;” — <em>“In all riches of assurance of understanding</em>. ” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(347)</span> See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 112, and vol. 2, p. 397. </p></div></div>
