Again, taking <em>the franc </em>(as Cotgrave rates it) at <em>two shillings</em>, 35 francs are also equal to <em>three pounds</em>, <em>ten shillings</em>. This is, at least, a curious coincidence, and the reader may compare it with a computation made from the <em>livre Parisis</em>, (<em>Harmony</em>, volume 2, page 234, n. 2.) It would appear, however, that Budaeus and Calvin had estimated the <em>denarius </em>at little more than half its real value, which was <em>sevenpence halfpenny </em>sterling, taking silver at five shillings per ounce; so that <em>two hundred denarii </em>would be equal to <em>six pounds</em>, <em>five shillings sterling</em>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(120)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quatorze (fourteen) sols Tournois</span>.” According to Cotgrave, the <em class="lang fr-fr">sol Tournois </em> is the tenth part of our shilling, or one part in six better than our penny.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(121)</span> “Sesquituronicum;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">un denier Tournois et maille</span>;” — “one and a half denier of Tours.” </p></div></div>
