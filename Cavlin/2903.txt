<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Speak unto the children of Israel. </em>Since in all sacrifices the fat was consecrated to God, and was burnt on the altar, God forbade His people to eat fat even in their ordinary meals, in order that they might cultivate piety even in their homes. For unquestionably this was an exercise of piety, that they who were far away from the temple should still accustom themselves in their daily meals to the service of God. Nor am I ignorant of the allegories <span class="cite-ref">(289)</span> in which some interpreters indulge, but I willingly acquiesce in the reason which God reveals, viz., that the people was prohibited from eating fat, because He had assigned it to Himself. Nevertheless, the Law permits the fat of a carcase, <span class="cite-ref">(290)</span> or of an animal torn (by beasts) to be applied to any use, provided they abstain from the fat of those animals which might be legally offered. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(289)</span><em>Vide </em>on <span class="bvs">Lev_3:16</span>, <em>ante, </em>p. 334. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(290)</span> See Margin, <em>A.
