<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_22:15</span><strong>.</strong><em>That they might entrap him in his words. The Pharisees, </em>perceiving that all their other attempts against Christ had been fruitless, at length concluded that the best and most expeditious method of destroying him was, <em>to deliver him to the governor, </em>as a seditious person and a disturber of the peace. There was at that time, as we have seen under another passage, <span class="cite-ref">(59)</span> a great disputing among the Jews about the <em>tribute-money; </em>for, since the Romans had claimed for themselves the <em>tribute-money, </em>which God commanded to be paid to Himself under the Law of Moses, (<span class="bvs">Exo_30:13</span>,) the Jews everywhere complained that it was a shameful and intolerable crime for profane men to lay claim, in this manner, to a divine prerogative; besides that, as this payment of tribute, which was enjoined on them by the Law, was a testimony of their adoption, they looked upon themselves as deprived of an honor to which they had a just claim. Now the deeper any man’s poverty was, <span class="cite-ref">(60)</span> the bolder did it render him to raise sedition. </p><p>This trick of taking Christ by surprise is therefore continued by <em>the Pharisees, </em>that, in whatever way he reply as to <em>the tribute money, </em>they may lay snares for him. If he affirm that they ought not to pay, he will be convicted of sedition. If, on the contrary, he acknowledge it to be justly due, he will be held to be an enemy of his nation, and a betrayer of the liberty of his country. Their principal object is, to lead the people to dislike him. This is the <em>entrapping </em>to which the Evangelists refer; for they suppose that Christ is surrounded on all sides by <em>nets, </em>so that he can no longer escape. Having avowed themselves to be his enemies, and knowing that they would, on that account, be suspected, they put forward — as Matthew <em>states </em>— <em>some of their disciples. </em>Luke<em>, </em>again, calls them <em>spies, who pretended to be righteous men; </em>that is, persons who deceitfully professed an honest and proper desire to learn: for <em>the pretense of righteousness </em>is not here used in a general sense, but is limited to the present occasion, because they would not have been received, had they not made a pretense of docility and of genuine zeal. </p><p><em>With the Herodians. </em>They take along with them <em>the Herodians, </em>because they were more favorable to the Roman government, and therefore would be more disposed to raise an accusation. It is worthy of attention that, though those sects had fierce contentions with each other, so bitter was their hatred against Christ, that they conspired to destroy him. What the sect of <em>the Herodions </em>was, we have formerly explained <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> for, Herod being only half a Jew, or a spurious and corrupt professor of the Law, those who desired that the Law should be kept with exactness and in <em>every </em>part, condemned him and his impure worship; but he had his flatterers, who gave plausible excuses for his false doctrine. In addition to the other sects, therefore, there sprung up at that time a religion of the Court. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(59)</span><em>Harmony</em>, vol. 2, p. 368 </p><p><span class="cite-note">(60)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Selon qu’un chacun estoit plus poure, et n’avoit rien à perdre</span>;” — “according as any man was poorer, and had nothing to lose.” Harmony, vol. 2. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(61)</span><em>Harmony, </em>vol 2, p. 282. </p></div></div>
