<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive </em>There can be little doubt that these words are intended to magnify the proofs of Divine favor granted upon the elevation of David to the throne, by contrasting the state of matters with that under Saul. The <em>ascending on high </em>implies the being previously low, and intimates, that under the melancholy confusions which had prevailed in the kingdom, there was no longer the same conspicuous display of the Divine glory as formerly. The government of Saul, which, from the first, had originated in a way that was condemnable, was doomed to fall under the displeasure of God, while his favor, on the other hand, was to be restored under David; and the undeniable appearances of this left no room for doubt that one who began his reign under such auspices was the object of the Divine choice. David, although he had acquitted himself with courage in the battles which were fought, ascribes all the glory of them to God, saying, that it was he who had taken captive the enemy, and forced them to pay tribute, and reduced the more fierce and rebellious to subjection. By the term <span class="lang he-il">סוררים</span><em>sorerim, rebellious, </em>contumacious, or revolters, he would evidently seem to mean a distinct class of persons from the other enemies, whom he mentions as having been taken captive; and it intimates, that while those who did not venture to resist, and who surrendered, had been brought under the yoke, the more proud and unyielding had been forced into submission. The end designed by this is stated in the words which follow, <em>that God might dwell in the midst of his people; </em>and that he might demonstrate himself to be an all-sufficient protector to those who put their trust in him. </p><p>As the passage which we have now been considering is applied by Paul in a more spiritual sense to Christ, (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:8</span>,) it may be necessary to show how this agrees with the meaning and scope of the Psalmist. It may be laid down as an incontrovertible truth, that David, in reigning over God’s ancient people, shadowed forth the beginning of Christ’s eternal kingdom. This must appear evident to every one who remembers the promise made to him of a never-failing succession, and which received its verification in the person of Christ. As God illustrated his power in David, by exalting him with the view of delivering his people, so has he magnified his name in his only begotten Son. But let us consider more particularly how the parallel holds. Christ, before he was exalted, emptied himself of his glory, having not merely assumed the form of a servant, but humbled himself to the death of the cross. To show how exactly the figure was fulfilled, Paul notices, that what David had foretold was accomplished in the person of Christ, by his being cast down to the lowest parts of the earth in the reproach and ignominy to which he was subjected, before he ascended to the right hand of his Father, (<span class="bvs">Psa_22:7</span>.) That in thinking upon the ascension, we might not confine our views to the body of Christ, our attention is called to the result and fruit of it, in his subjecting heaven and earth to his government. Those who were formerly his inveterate enemies he compelled to submission and made tributary — this being the effect of the word of the Gospel, to lead men to renounce their pride and their obstinacy, to bring down every high thought which exalteth itself, and reduce the senses and the affections of men to obedience unto Christ. As to the devils and reprobate men who are instigated to rebellion and revolt by obstinate malice, he holds them bound by a secret control, and prevents them from executing intended destruction. So far the parallel is complete. Nor when Paul speaks of Christ having <em>given gifts to men, </em>is there any real inconsistency with what is here stated, although he has altered the words, having followed the Greek version in accommodation to the unlearned reader. <span class="cite-ref">(39)</span> It was not himself that God enriched with the spoils of the enemy, but his people; and neither did Christ seek or need to seek his own advancement, but made his enemies tributary, that he might adorn his Church with the spoil. From the close union subsisting between the head and members, to say that God manifest in the flesh received gifts from the captives, is one and the same thing with saying that he distributed them to his Church. What is said in the close of the verse is no less applicable to Christ — that he obtained his victories that as God he might dwell among us. Although he departed, it was not that he might remove to a distance from us, but, as Paul says, “that he might fill all things,” (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:10</span>.) By his ascension to heaven, the glory of his divinity has been only more illustriously displayed, and though no longer present with us in the flesh, our souls receive spiritual nourishment from his body and blood, and we find, notwithstanding distance of place, that his flesh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(39)</span> Paul’s words are not exactly those of the Septuagint, the present reading of which is, <span class="lang el-gr">ἔλαβες δοματα ἐν ἀνθρώπω</span>, “Thou hast received gifts for man;” while Paul’s words are, <span class="lang el-gr">ἔδωκε δόματα τοῖς ἀνθρώποις</span> But Bloomfield thinks that <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν ἀςθρώπω</span> in the Septuagint is a corruption for <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπ᾿ ἀνθρώποις</span>; and that Paul read in that version <span class="lang el-gr">ἔλαθες δοματα ἐπ᾿ ανθρώποις</span>, which is the true sense of the Hebrew words, being no other than this, “Thou hast received gifts on account of men;” <em>i e</em>. , to give to men. Paul, therefore, might say <span class="lang el-gr">ἔδωκε</span> instead of <span class="lang el-gr">ἔλαθες ἐπι, </span> to make the sense plainer; as also does the Chaldee Paraphrast, and the Syriac and Arabic translators. Paul’s words are evidently not intended to be a regular quotation, as appears from his changing the second person into the third. </p></div></div>
