<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Which of you by anxious care, etc ? </em>Here our Lord condemns another fault, which is almost always connected with immoderate anxiety about food: and that is, when a mortal man, claiming more than he has a right to do, does not hesitate, in sacrilegious hardihood, to go beyond his limits. </p><p>“O Lord, I know (says Jeremiah) that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Jer_10:23</span>.) </p><p>You scarcely meet with one person in a hundred, who does not venture to make any promises that he thinks fit on his own industry and power. The consequence is, that those who take credit to themselves for their prosperity, do not hesitate to lose sight of God, when they enter into any undertaking. To restrain this mad rashness, Christ tells us, that whatever contributes to the support of our life depends wholly on the blessing of God. The meaning is: “It is foolish in men to weary themselves, because all our labors are unnecessary and fruitless, and all our anxieties are to no purpose, unless so far as God blesses them.” This is more clearly expressed by Luke, <em>If you cannot do even that which is least, why are you anxious about the rest? </em>These words show plainly, that Christ reproves not only distrust, but pride, because men ascribe much more than they ought to their own skill. </p></div>
