<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13</strong><em>But wicked men and impostors </em>This is the most bitter of all persecutions, when we see wicked men, with their sacrilegious hardihood, with their blasphemies and errors, gathering strength. Thus Paul says elsewhere, that Ishmael persecuted Isaac, not by the sword, but by mockery (<span class="bvs">Gal_4:29</span>.) Hence also we may conclude, that in the preceding verse, it was not merely one kind of persecution that was described, but that the Apostle spoke, in general terms, of those distresses which the children of God are compelled to endure, when they contend for the glory of their Father. </p><p>I stated, a little before, in what respect they <em>shall grow worse and worse; </em>for he foretells not only that they will make obstinate resistance, but that they will succeed in injuring and corrupting others. One worthless person will always be more effectual in destroying, than ten faithful teachers in building, though they labor with all their might. Nor are there ever wanting the tares which Satan sows for injuring the pure corn; and even when we think that false prophets are driven away, others continually spring up in other directions. </p><p>Again, as to the power of doing injury, <span class="cite-ref">(188)</span> it is not because falsehood, in its own nature, is stronger than truth, or that the tricks of Satan exceed the energy of the Spirit of God; but because men, being naturally inclined to vanity and errors, embrace far more readily what agrees with their natural disposition, and also because, being blinded by a righteous vengeance of God, they are led, as captive slaves, at the will of Satan. <span class="cite-ref">(189)</span> And the chief reason, why the plague of wicked doctrines is so efficacious, is, that the ingratitude of men deserves that it should be so. It is highly necessary for godly teachers to be reminded of this, that they may be prepared for uninterrupted warfare, and may not be discouraged by delay, or yield to the haughtiness and insolence of adversaries. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(188)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si on demande d’ou vient ceste puissance et facilite de nuire</span> ?” — “If it be asked, Whence comes this power and facility of doing injury?” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(189)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Satan les tire, d’un coste et d’autre, a son plaisir</span>.” — “Satan leads them, on one side or another, at his pleasure.” </p></div></div>
