<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>While my enemies are turned back. </em>In these words he assigns the reason why he undertakes to sing the praises of God, namely, because he acknowledges that his frequent victories had been achieved, not by his own power, nor by the power of his soldiers, but by the free favor of God. In the first part of the verse he narrates historically how his enemies were discomfited or put to flight; and then he adds, what faith alone could enable him to say, that this did not take place by the power of man or by chance, but because God fought for him, <span class="cite-ref">(164)</span> and stood against them in the battle. He says, <em>they fall, </em><span class="cite-ref">(165)</span><em>and are put to flight </em>At Thy Presence. David therefore acted wisely, when, upon seeing his enemies turn their backs, he lifted up the eyes of his mind to God, in order to perceive that victory flowed to him from no other source than from the secret and incomprehensible aid of God. And, doubtless, it is He only who guides the simple by the spirit of wisdom, while he inflicts madness on the crafty, and strikes them with amazement, — who inspires with courage the faint and timid, while he causes the boldest to tremble with fear, — who restores to the feeble their strength, while he reduces the strong to weakness, — who upholds the fainthearted by his power, while he makes the sword to fall from the hands of the valiant; - and, finally, who brings the battle to a prosperous or disastrous issue, just as he pleases. When, therefore, we see our enemies overthrown, we must beware of limiting our view to what is visible to the eye of sense, like ungodly men, who, while they see with their bodily eyes, are yet blind; but let us instantly call to our remembrance this truth, that when our enemies turn back, they are put to flight by the presence of the Lord. <span class="cite-ref">(166)</span> The verbs, <em>fall </em>and <em>put to flight, </em>in the Hebrew, are in the future tense, but I have translated them in the present, because David anew presents to his own view the goodness of God which had formerly been manifested towards him. </p><p><strong>(164)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais pource que Dieu a battacile pour luy</span>. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(165)</strong> The idea implied in the verb <span class="lang he-il">כשל</span>, <em>cashal, </em>is that of stumbling, and it is here employed in a military sense. In <span class="bvs">Psa_27:2</span>, where it is said of David’s enemies, “they stumbled and fell;” this is the verb used for <em>stumbled. </em>The idea there is not properly that of falling, but of being wounded and weakened by the stumbling-blocks in the way, previous to falling. The word <span class="lang he-il">כשל</span>,<em>cashal, </em>has been viewed as having the same meaning in the passage before us. “It refers,” says <em>Hammond</em>, “to those that either faint in a march or are wounded in a battle, or especially that in flight meet with galling traps in their way, and so are galled and lamed, rendered unable to go forward, and so fall, and become liable to all the ill chances of pursuits, and as here are overtaken and perish in the fall.” </p><p><strong>(166)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est la face de Dieu qui les poursuit</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “It is the face of God which pursues them.” </p></div>
