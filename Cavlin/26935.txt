<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong>That he may pass over unto another history, he showeth that the disciples being returned unto Jerusalem, dwelt together in one parlor. For it was the upper part of the house, which used to be let out unto those which did hire houses; <span class="cite-ref">(46)</span> for the most commodious places were reserved unto them that were masters of the house, (for their own use.) Wherefore, by this word Luke doth signify that they were driven into a strait room; <span class="cite-ref">(47)</span> and yet, notwithstanding, though this commodity were great, yet they did not part asunder. They might have been more commodiously asunder, yet might they not part company before they had received the Spirit. In that he noteth here the distance of place, it bringeth credit unto the history. Unless, peradventure, he meant hereby to declare that they were not terrified with any fear of danger, but that they did all return and kept company together in one house, which was not so large, but that the company being greater than the place could well contain, it might breed some rumor (or noise.) A Sabbath-day’s journey was two miles, and that account doth well agree with the place of <span class="bvs">Joh_11:18</span>, where he saith, “that Jerusalem was distant from Bethany almost fifteen furlongs;” which containeth about a thousand and nine hundred paces. And the mount Olivet was at the side of Bethany. There was no Sabbath-day’s journey prescribed in the law; for the Lord doth command them simply to rest upon the Sabbath-day in the law. <span class="cite-ref">(48)</span> But because the Jews could not easily be ruled, but that they would run abroad about their business upon the Sabbath-day, (as the Lord himself doth complain, “that they did bear burdens out at the gates,”) (<span class="bvs">Jer_17:24</span>,) therefore, it is to be thought that it was determined by the priests, <span class="cite-ref">(49)</span> (to the end they might restrain such enormities,) that no man should travel upon the Sabbath-day above two miles. Although Jerome, in his Answers unto Algasia, doth say that this tradition did come from two Rabbins, namely, from Atriba, and from Simon Heli. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(46)</span> “Inquilinis,” tenants or lodgers. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(47)</span> “In angustum locum fuisse constrictos,” were confined to a narrow space. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(48)</span> More properly, For the Lord doth in the law command, etc. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(49)</span> “Communi sacerdotum concilio,” by the common council of the priests, the Sanhedrim. </p></div></div>
