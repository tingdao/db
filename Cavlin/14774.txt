<div class="comment-content"><p>To him we find David appealing in the words that follow, <em>Exalt thyself, O God! above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth. </em>To perceive the appropriateness of this prayer, it is necessary that we reflect upon the height of audacity and pride to which the wicked proceed, when unrestrained by the providence of God, and upon the formidable nature of that conspiracy which was directed against David by Saul, and the nation in general, all which demanded a signal manifestation of divine power on his behalf. Nor is it a small comfort to consider that God, in appearing for the help of his people, at the same time advances his own glory. Against it, as well as against them, is the opposition of the wicked directed, and he will never suffer his glory to be obscured, or his holy name to be polluted with their blasphemies. The Psalmist reverts to the language of complaint. He had spoken of the cruel persecution to which he was subjected, and now bewails the treachery and deceit which were practiced against him. His soul he describes as being <em>bowed down, </em>in allusion to the crouching of the body when one is under the influence of fear, or to birds when terrified by the fowler and his nets, which dare not move a feather, but lie flat upon the ground. Some read, <em>He has bowed down my soul </em>But the other is the most obvious rendering, and the verb <span class="lang he-il">כפף</span>, <em>caphaph, </em>is one which is frequently taken with the neuter signification. Although the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">נפש</span>,<em>nephesh, </em>rendered <em>soul, </em>is feminine, this is not the only place where we find it with a masculine adjunct. </p></div>
