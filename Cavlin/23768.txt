<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother. </em>It is uncertain whether Moses represents Adam or God as speaking these words; but it is of little consequence to the present passage which of these meanings you choose, for it was enough to quote the decision which God had pronounced, though it might have been uttered by the mouth of Adam. Now he who marries a wife is not commanded absolutely to <em>leave his father</em>; for God would contradict himself, if by marriage He set aside those duties which He enjoins on children towards their parents; but when a comparison is made between the claims, the <em>wife </em>is preferred to the <em>father and mother </em>But if any man abandon his father, and shake off the yoke by which he is bound, no man will own such a monster; <span class="cite-ref">(595)</span> much less will he be at liberty to dissolve a marriage. </p><p><em>And the two shall be one flesh. </em>This expression condemns polygamy not less than it condemns unrestrained liberty in divorcing wives; for, if the mutual union of two persons was consecrated by the Lord, the mixture of three or four persons is unauthorized. <span class="cite-ref">(596)</span> But Christ, as I stated a little ago, applies it in a different manner to his purpose; namely, to show that whoever divorces his wife tears himself in pieces, because such is the force of holy marriage, that the husband and wife become one man. For it was not the design of Christ to introduce the impure and filthy speculation of Plato, but he spoke with reverence of the order which God has established. Let the husband and wife, therefore, live together in such a manner, that each shall cherish the other in the same manner as if they were the half of themselves. Let the husband rule, so as to be the head, and not the tyrant, of his wife; and let the woman, on the other hand, yield modestly to his commands. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(595)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’y a celuy qui ne fust estonne d’un tel monstre</span>;” — “there is no man who would not be astonished at such a monster.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(596)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est un meslinge faux et pervers</span>;” — “it is a false and wicked mixture.” </p></div></div>
