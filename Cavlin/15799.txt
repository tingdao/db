<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>He hath given a portion to them that fear him </em>The Church being a mirror of the grace and justice of God, what the prophet said respecting them is here expressly applied to her; not that he designs to treat of the justice of God, in general, but only of that which he peculiarly displays towards his own people. Hence he adds, that God’s care of his people is such as to lead him to make ample provision for the supply of all their wants. The word <span class="lang he-il">טרף</span>, <em>tereph, </em>which we have translated <em>portion, </em>is frequently taken for <em>a prey: </em><span class="cite-ref">(339)</span> others render it <em>meat; </em>but I rather choose to render it <em>portion, </em>in which sense it is taken in <span class="bvs">Pro_30:8</span>, and <span class="bvs">Pro_31:15</span>; as if he should say, that God had given his people all that was needful, and that, considered as a portion, it was large and liberal; for we know that the people of Israel were enriched, not in consequence of their own industry, but by the blessing of God, who, like the father of a family, bestows upon his household every thing necessary for their subsistence. In the following clause of the verse, he assigns as the reason for his care and kindness, his desire of effectually demonstrating that his covenant was not null and void. And here it must be carefully observed, that if, in former times, and from a respect to his gracious covenant, he manifested so great kindness towards the people of Israel, in like manner, the goodness which we receive from him is the result of our adoption into his family; and because God is never weary in showing kindness to his people, he says that the remembrance of his covenant shall never be effaced. Moreover, as he daily and constantly loads us with his benefits, so our faith must, in some measure, correspond with it: it must not fail, but must rise above life and death. </p><p>The next verse is subjoined, by way of exposition, for the purpose of showing that God, in bestowing upon his people the heritage of the heathen, had manifested to them the power of his works. He does indeed employ the term <em>show, </em>but he means a true showing; because the possession of the Holy Land was not acquired by mere human power, but it was given to them by Divine power, and through the working of many miracles; and thus God, as it were, openly testified to the descendants of Abraham with what incomparable power he is invested. It is on this account that he sets up the people of Israel as a match for so many other nations, who would assuredly never have vanquished so many enemies, unless they had been sustained from on high. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(339)</span> “<em>Given meat </em>— Heb<em>., </em>‘Prey;’ <em>i.e</em>. , food. Some think this refers to the <em>manna </em>rained upon Israel in the wilderness; we should rather think, to the quails. See <span class="bvs">Psa_105:40</span>.” — <em>Williams</em>. “<span class="lang he-il">טרף</span>. This word is usually translated <em>prey, </em>and the passage is thought, by some, to refer to the spoiling of the Egyptians by the Israelites, mentioned in <span class="bvs">Exo_12:36</span>. It is, however, more probable that <span class="lang he-il">טרף</span> signifies here<em>food, </em>and that allusion is made to the manna with which the children of Israel were fed in the wilderness. See <span class="bvs">Pro_31:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Mal_3:10</span>. The first hemistich is the consequence of what is stated in the second; <em>i.e., because </em>God remembered his covenant, <em>therefore </em>he gave food to them who fear him.” — <em>Phillips. </em></p></div></div>
