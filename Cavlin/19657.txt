<div class="comment-content"><p>By saying, <em>I will give </em>(or <em>deliver</em>) <em>them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, </em>the Prophet still more clearly expresses what I have just said, that they would be thus slain by the order of the king, because God had determined what was to be done to them. And he assigns the cause of their death or mentions its author, that the Jews might not fix their eyes on the king of Babylon. What had Nebuchadnezzar in view? to preserve a peaceable kingdom; he saw the danger of a tumult if he pardoned these two men, who had disturbed the people. Lest, then, the Jews should look only on the design of the king, God here sets before them another and a higher reason, even because they <em>prophesied falsely </em>in his <em>name. A </em>clearer explanation follows, â€” </p></div>
