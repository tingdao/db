<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>But are like the angels of God in heaven. </em>He does not mean that the children of God will be, in all respects, <em>like the angels, </em>but only so far as they shall be free from every infirmity of the present life; thus affirming that they will no longer be exposed to the wants of a frail and perishing life. Luke expresses more clearly the nature of the resemblance, that they can no longer die, and therefore there will be no propagation of their species, as on earth. Now he speaks of believers only, for no mention had been made of the wicked. </p><p>But a question arises, Why does he say that they will then be <em>the children of God, </em>because they will be <em>children of the resurrection; </em>since God bestows this honor on those who believe on him, though shut up within the frail prison of the body? And how would we be heirs of eternal life after death, unless God already acknowledged us as children? I reply: As we are engrafted by faith into the body of Christ, we are adopted by God as his children, and of this <em>adoption the Spirit is the witness, seal, earnest, and pledge, </em>so that with this assurance </p><p>we may freely cry, Abba, Father, (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Gal_4:6</span>.) </p><p>Now though we know that we are the children of God, yet as it doth not yet appear what we shall be, till, transformed into his glory, we shall see him as he is, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Jo_3:2</span>,) </p><p>we are not as yet actually reckoned to be his children. And though we are renewed by the Spirit of God, yet as </p><p>our life is still hidden, (<span class="bvs">Col_3:3</span>,) </p><p>the manifestation of it will truly and perfectly distinguish us from strangers. In this sense our <em>adoption </em>is said by Paul to be delayed till the last day, (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:23</span>.). </p></div>
