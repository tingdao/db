<div class="comment-content"><p>His reproof of the fault previously noticed was but a mild and gentle admonition, because the Corinthians sinned in ignorance, so that it was proper that they should readily be forgiven. Paul, too, had praised them in the outset, because they had faithfully <em>kept his enactments</em>. (<span class="bvs">1Co_11:2</span>.) Now he begins to reprove them more sharply, because they offended more grievously in some things, and not through ignorance. </p><p>17. <em>But, in warning you as to this, I do not praise. </em><span class="cite-ref">(644)</span> For I translate it in this way, because Paul appears to have made the participle and the verb change places. <span class="cite-ref">(645)</span> I am also not satisfied with the interpretation of Erasmus, who takes <span class="lang el-gr">παραγγέλλειν</span> as meaning to <em>command </em>The verb to <em>warn </em>would suit better, but as to this I do not contend. There is an antithesis between this clause and the beginning of this chapter. “While I have praised you, do not think that it is unqualified commendation; for I have something to find fault with, as it is worthy of severe reproof.” This, however, in my opinion, does not refer exclusively to the Lord’s Supper, but also to other faults of which he makes mention. Let this then be taken as a general statement, that the Corinthians are reproved, because they <em>came together not for the better but for the worse. </em>Particular effects of this evil will be brought forward afterwards. </p><p>He finds fault with them, then, in the <em>first </em>place, because they <em>come not together for the better</em>, — and<em>secondly</em>, that they <em>come together for the worse </em>The <em>second</em>, it is true, is the more serious, but even the <em>first </em>is not to be endured, for if we consider what is transacted in the Church, there ought never to be a <em>coming together </em>without some fruit. <em>There </em>the doctrine of God is listened to, prayers are offered up, the Sacraments are administered. The fruit of the Word is, when confidence in God and fear of him are increased in us — when progress is made in holiness of life — when we put off more and more the <em>old man</em>, (<span class="bvs">Col_3:9</span>) — when we advance in <em>newness of life</em>, etc. (<span class="bvs">Rom_6:4</span>.) The Sacraments have a tendency to exercise us in piety and love. The prayers, too, ought to be of use for promoting all these purposes. In addition to this, the Lord works efficaciously by his Spirit, because he wills not that his ordinances should be vain. Hence if the sacred assemblies are of no benefit to us, and we are not made better by them, it is our ingratitude that is to blame, and therefore we deserve to be reproved. For the effect of our conduct is, that those things, which, from their own nature, and from God’s appointment, ought to have been salutary, become unprofitable. </p><p>Then follows the <em>second </em>fault — that they <em>come together for the worse. </em>This is much more criminal, and yet it almost always follows the other, for if we derive no advantage from God’s benefits, he employs this method of punishing our carelessness — that we are <em>made worse </em>by them. It usually happens, too, that negligence gives birth to many corruptions, especially on this account, that those who do not observe the natural use of things usually fall erelong into hurtful inventions. <span class="cite-ref">(646)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(644)</span> “<em class="lang fr-fr">Or ie vous rememore ceci</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">non point eu louant</em><span class="lang fr-fr">.
