<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Your joy no man shall take from you. </em>The value of <em>the joy </em>is greatly enhanced by its perpetuity; for it follows that the afflictions are light, and ought to be patiently endured, because they are of short duration. By these words Christ reminds us what is the nature of true <em>joy </em>The world must unavoidably be soon deprived of its <em>joys</em>, which it seeks only in fading things; and, therefore, we must come to the resurrection of Christ, in which there is eternal solidity. </p><p><em>But I will see you again. </em>When he says that he <em>will see </em>his disciples, he means that he will visit them again by the grace of his Spirit, that they may continually enjoy his presence. </p></div>
