<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Happy are they who hunger </em>To <em>hunger and thirst </em>is here, I think, used as a figurative expression, <span class="cite-ref">(366)</span> and means to suffer poverty, to want the necessaries of life, and even to be defrauded of one’s right. Matthew says, <em>who thirst after righteousness, </em>and thus makes one class stand for all the rest. He represents more strongly the unworthy treatment which they have received, when he says that, though they are anxious, though they groan, they desire nothing but what is proper. “Happy are they who, though their wishes are so moderate, that they desire nothing to be granted to them but what is reasonable, are yet in a languishing condition, like persons who are famishing with hunger.” Though their distressing anxiety exposes them to the ridicule of others, yet it is a certain preparation for <em>happiness: </em>for at length <em>they shall be satisfied </em>God will one day listen to their groans, and satisfy their just desires for to Him, as we learn from the song of the Virgin, it belongs to <em>fill the hungry with good things, </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_1:53</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(366)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par une figure qu'on appelle </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Synecdoche </em><em>;” </em>—<em>“ </em>by a figure which is called <em>Synecdoche,” </em>in which a part is put for the whole. </p></div></div>
