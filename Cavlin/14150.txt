<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>For who is God besides Jehovah? </em>David here, deriding the foolish inventions of men, who, according to their own fancy, make for themselves tutelary gods, <span class="cite-ref">(426)</span> confirms what I have said before, that he never undertook any thing but by the authority and command of God. If he had passed beyond the limits of his calling, he could not with such confidence have said that God was on his side. Besides, although in these words he opposes to the true God all the false gods invented by men, his purpose, at the same time, is to overthrow all the vain hopes in which the world is wrapped up, and by which it is carried about, and prevented from resting in God. The question which David here treats of is not the bare title and name of <em>God, </em>but he declares that whatever assistance we need we should seek it from God, and from no other quarter, because he alone is endued with power: <em>Who is strong except our God? </em>We should, however, attend to the design of David, which I have first adverted to, namely, that, by confidently representing God as opposed to all his enemies, and as the leader, under whose standard he had valiantly fought against them, he means to affirm that he had attempted nothing according to his own fancy, or with an evil and condemning conscience. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(426)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui se forgent a leur fantasie des dieux qui soyent leurs protecteurs et patrons</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em>“Who, according to their own fancy, make for themselves gods to be their protectors and patrons.” </p></div></div>
