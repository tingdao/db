<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>And Abram said, Lord God</em>. The Hebrew text has <span class="lang he-il">יחוה אדונת</span> (<em>Adonai Jehovah</em>.) From which appellation it is inferred that some special mark of divine glory was stamped upon the vision; so that Abram, having no doubt respecting its author, confidently broke out in this expression. For since Satan is a wonderful adept at deceiving, and deludes men with so many wiles in the name of God, it was necessary that some sure and notable distinction should appear in true and heavenly oracles, which would not suffer the faith and the minds of the holy fathers to waver. Therefore in the vision of which mention is made, the majesty of the God of Abram was manifested, which would suffice for the confirmation of his faith. Not that God appeared as he really is, but only so far as he might be comprehended by the human mind. But Abram, in overlooking a promise so glorious, in complaining that he is childless, and in murmuring against God, for having hitherto given him no seed, seems to conduct himself with little modesty. What was more desirable than to be received under God’s protection, and to be happy in the enjoyment of Him? The objection, therefore, which Abram raised, when disparaging the incomparable benefit offered to him, and refusing to rest contented until he receives offspring, appears to be wanting in reverence. Yet the liberty which he took admits of excuse; first, because the Lord permits us to pour into his bosom those cares by which we are tormented, and those troubles with which we are oppressed. Secondly, the design of the complaint is to be considered; for he does not simply declare that he is solitary, but, seeing that the effect of all the promises depended upon his seed, he does, not improperly, require that a pledge so necessary should be given him. For if the benediction and salvation of the world was not to be hoped for except through his seed; when that principal point seemed to fail him, it is not to be wondered at, that other things should seem to vanish from his sight, or should at least not appease his mind, nor satisfy his wishes. And this is the very reason why God not only regards with favor the complaint of his servant, but immediately gives a propitious answer to his prayer. Moses indeed ascribes to Abram that affection which is naturally inherent in us all; but this is no proof that Abram did not look higher when he so earnestly desired to be the progenitor of an heir. And certainly these promises had not faded from his recollection; ‘To thy seed will I give this land,’ and ‘In thy seed shall all nations be blessed;’ the former of which promises is so annexed to all the rest, that if it be taken away, all confidence in them would perish; while the latter promise contains in it the whole gratuitous pledge of salvation. Therefore Abram rightly includes in it, every thing which God had promised. </p><p><em>I go childless</em>. The language is metaphorical. We know that our life is like a race. Abram, seeing he was of advanced age, says that he has so far proceeded, that little of his course still remains. ‘Now,’ he says, ‘I am come near the goal; and the course of my life being finished, I shall die childless.’ He adds, for the sake of aggravating the indignity, ‘that a foreigner would be his heir.’ For I do not doubt that Damascus is the name of his <em>country</em>, and not the proper name of his <em>mother</em>, as some falsely suppose; as if he had said, ‘Not one of my own relatives will be my heir, but a Syrian from Damascus.’ For, perhaps, Abram had bought him in Mesopotamia. He also calls him the son of <span class="lang he-il">משק</span> (<em>mesek</em>,) concerning the meaning of which word grammarians are not agreed. Some derive it from <span class="lang he-il">שקק</span> (<em>shakak</em>,) which means to run to and fro, and translate it, <em>steward </em>or <em>superintendent</em>, because he who sustains the care of a large house, runs hither and thither in attending to his business. Others derive it from <span class="lang he-il">שוק</span> (<em>shook</em>,) and render it <em>cup-bearer</em>, which seems to me incongruous. I rather adopt a different translation, namely, that he was called the son of the deserted house, (<em>filius derelictionis </em><span class="cite-ref">(370)</span>), because <span class="lang he-il">משק</span><em>mashak </em>sometimes signifies to <em>leave</em>. Yet I do not conceive him to be so called because Abram was about to leave all things to him; but because Abram himself had no hope left in any other. It is therefore (in my judgment) just as if he called him the son of a house destitute of children, <span class="cite-ref">(371)</span> because this was a proof of a deserted and barren house, that the inheritance was devolving upon a foreigner who would occupy the empty and deserted place. He afterwards contemptuously calls him his servant, or his home-born slave, ‘the son of my house (he says) will be my heir.’ He thus speaks in contempt, as if he would say, ‘My condition is wretched, who shall not have even a freeman for my successor.’ It is however asked, how he could be both a Damascene and a home-born slave of Abram? There are two solutions of the difficulty, either that he was called the son of the house, not because he was <em>born</em>, but only because he was <em>educated </em>in it; or, that he sprang from Damascus, because his father was from Syria. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(370)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Et filius derelictionis domus meae erit iste Dammescenus Elihezer.” That is, according to the usual interpretation of the Hebrew phrase, the son or person to whom the house was left in charge by its master; though Calvin gives it a different turn. The various ancient versions, except the Syriac, agree in this interpretation. Dathe prefers the translation of Schultens, who refers the word to an Arabic root, <span class="lang he-il">שוק</span>, which signifies to comb, to dress, or polish, and which he supposes may be applied generally to the care which a steward takes of everything in the house. But this is fanciful. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(371)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Acsi vocaret, Filium orbitatis.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme s’il l’appeloit, Fils de la maison, ou il n’y a point d’enfans</span>.” — <em>French Tr </em></p></div></div>
