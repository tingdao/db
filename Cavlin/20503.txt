At length the particle <span class="lang he-il">הי</span>, <em>hei, </em>is added in the sense of grieving.

As to the rest of the people, we shall see afterwards, in many places, that he was a messenger of God’s mercy, but his duty was to rouse up the Jews, that they might feel God their adversary: thus the Prophet was sent with no other object than that of going, as an armed man, into the midst,, and uttering threats in the name of God.
