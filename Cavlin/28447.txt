<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>I write not these things to shame you </em>As the foregoing instances of irony were very pointed, so that they might exasperate the minds of the Corinthians, he now obviates that dissatisfaction by declaring, that he had not said these things with a view to cover them with shame, but rather to admonish them with paternal affection. It is indeed certain that this is the nature and tendency of a father’s chastisement, to make his son feel ashamed; for the first token of return to a right state of mind is the shame which the son begins to feel on being reproached for his fault. The object, then, which the father has in view when he chastises his son with reproofs, is that he may bring him to be displeased with himself. And we see that the tendency of what Paul has said hitherto, is to make the Corinthians ashamed of themselves. Nay more, we shall find him a little afterwards (<span class="bvs">1Co_6:5</span>) declaring that he made mention of their faults in order that they may begin to be ashamed. Here, however, he simply means to intimate, that it was not his design to heap disgrace upon them, or to expose their sins publicly and openly with a view to their reproach. For he who admonishes in a friendly spirit, makes it his particular care that whatever there is of shame, may remain with the individual whom he admonishes, <span class="cite-ref">(250)</span> and may in this manner be buried. On the other hand, the man who reproaches with a malignant disposition, inflicts disgrace upon the man whom he reproves for his fault, in such a manner as to hold him up to the reproach of all. Paul then simply affirms that what he had said, had been said by him, with no disposition to upbraid, or with any view to hurt their reputation, but, on the contrary, with paternal affection he admonished them as to what he saw to be defective in them. </p><p>But what was the design of this admonition? It was that the Corinthians, who were puffed up with mere empty notions, might learn to glory, as he did, in the abasement of the cross, and might no longer despise him on those grounds on which he was deservedly honorable in the sight of God and angels — in fine, that, laying aside their accustomed haughtiness, they might set a higher value on those <em>marks </em><span class="cite-ref">(251)</span><em>of Christ </em>(<span class="bvs">Gal_6:17</span>) that were upon him, than on the empty and counterfeit show of the false apostles. Let teachers <span class="cite-ref">(252)</span> infer from this, that in reproofs they must always use such moderation as not to wound men’s minds with excessive severity, and that, agreeably to the common proverb, they must mix honey or oil with vinegar — that they must above all things take care not to appear to triumph over those whom they reprove, or to take delight in their disgrace — nay more, that they must endeavor to make it understood that they seek nothing but that their welfare may be promoted. For what good will the teacher <span class="cite-ref">(253)</span> do by mere bawling, if he does not season the sharpness of his reproof by that moderation of which I have spoken? Hence if we are desirous to do any good by <em>correcting </em>men’s faults, we must distinctly give them to know, that our reproofs proceed from a friendly disposition. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(250)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tasche sur toutes choses que toute la honte demeure entre lui et celui lequel il admoneste</span>;” — “Endeavors above all things that the shame may remain between him and the person whom he admonishes.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(251)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les marques et fietrisseurs de Christ en luy</span>;” — “The marks and brands of Christ in him.” The allusion, as our Author himself remarks, when commenting upon <span class="bvs">Gal_6:17</span>, is to “the marks with which barbarian slaves, or fugitives, or malefactors were <em>branded</em>. ” Hence the expression of Juvenal: <em>stigmate </em>dignum credere — “to reckon one worthy of being <em>branded </em>as a slave.” (Juv. 10. 183.) — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(252)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les docteurs et ministres</span>;” — “Teachers and ministers.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(253)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le ministre</span> :” — “The minister.” </p></div></div>
