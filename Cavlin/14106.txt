<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>From the presence of thy countenance. </em>Literally it is, <em>from before thy face, </em>or, <em>before thy face. </em>By these words David intimates that if God does not rise up as the vindicator of his cause, he will be overwhelmed with calumnies though innocent, and will be looked upon as a guilty and condemned person. The cognisance which God will take of his cause is tacitly set in opposition to the dark inventions of falsehood which were spread against him. <span class="cite-ref">(341)</span> His language is as if he had said, I do not ask for any other judge but God, nor do I shrink from standing before his judgment-seat, <span class="cite-ref">(342)</span> since I bring with me both a pure heart and a good cause. What he immediately adds with respect to God’s <em>looking upon </em>his uprightness is of similar import. He does not mean to say that God is blind, but only beseeches him actually to show that he does not connive at the wickedness of men, and that it is not to him a matter of indifference when he beholds those who have not the means of defending themselves <span class="cite-ref">(343)</span> receiving evil treatment undeservedly. Some take the word<em>judgment </em>in too restricted a sense for the right to the kingdom which was promised to David, as if he petitioned to be placed on the royal throne by the power of God, inasmuch as he had been chosen by him to be king, and had also, in his name and by his authority, been anointed to this office by the hand of Samuel. The meaning which I attach to David’s language is simply this, that being oppressed with many and varied wrongs, he commits himself to the protection and defense of God. </p><p><strong>(341)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car la cognoissance que Dieu prendra de sa cause est tacitement mise in l’opposite des tenebres des mensonges qu’on semoit contre luy</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(342)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et qu’il ne refuse point de respondre derant le siege judicial d’iceluy</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em>“Nor do I refuse to answer before his judgment-seat.” </p><p><strong>(343)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui n’ont pas moyen de se defendre</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em></p></div>
