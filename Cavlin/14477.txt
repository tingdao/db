<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26</strong><em>He is daily merciful </em>The Psalmist here repeats what he had already said, that the grace of God is a fountain of all blessings which can never be exhausted; and, therefore, while it is displayed towards the faithful, they not only have enough for the supply of their own wants, but are able also liberally to assist others. What he adds concerning <em>their seed </em>is variously expounded. That he is speaking of the children of the godly, there can be no doubt; and this is evident from the preceding verse. But when he says that they <em>shall be for blessing, </em><span class="cite-ref">(41)</span> some understand it as if he had said, They shall be the ministers of God’s liberality: so that, according to them, the sense would be, that they shall follow the good example of their fathers in helping the poor, and in exercising liberality towards all men. But I fear that this exposition is too refined. Nor do I admit the interpretation which has been given by others, that the meaning is, that the grace of God shall be so signally manifested towards the children of the godly, that their names shall be employed in a form of prayer, when prosperity and success are prayed for. This mode of expression, I allow, is to be so understood in various places; but here, in my opinion, David designs nothing more than to extol the continuation of God’s favor from the fathers to their children: as if he had said, God’s blessing does not terminate with the death of the righteous man, but it extends even to his children. <span class="cite-ref">(42)</span> And there is indeed no inheritance more certain to which our children may succeed us, than when God, receiving them in like manner into his fatherly favor, makes them partakers of his blessing. </p><p><strong>(41)</strong> This is also the reading of the Septuagint, <span class="lang el-gr">Τὸ σπέζμα αὐτου εἰς εὐλογίαν ἕσται</span></p><p><strong>(42)</strong> Ainsworth reads, “And his seed are in the blessing,” and understands the words as meaning, that the children of the just man “are in the blessing, or are appointed to the blessing, as the heirs thereof,” <span class="bvs">Gen_28:3</span>; <span class="bvs">1Pe_3:9</span>; and that they have still abundance, notwithstanding the liberality of their parents; for “the blessing of the Lord maketh rich,” <span class="bvs">Pro_10:22</span>. </p></div>
