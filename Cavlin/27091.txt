<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>And we are his witnesses. </em>After that they have declared that their doctrine came from God, they descend now unto the other part that they speak as they were commanded by God, lest they seem to attempt anything unadvisedly. For this also was a necessary defense, as it is for all the ministers of the gospel, to wit, that they make this openly known to all men that they teach nothing but that which they have received of God. Secondly, that they are called hereunto, so that they cannot avoid the necessity of teaching, unless they will resist God. Luke putteth <em>words </em>in this place, instead of <em>things, </em>according to the Hebrew phrase. Although if any man had rather understand it of the speech itself, I do not deny but that it may be so. The sum is, seeing they are brought forth by God to be witnesses, they may not give back, <span class="cite-ref">(277)</span> but they must publish things which he hath commanded. </p><p><em>And also the Spirit. </em>They confirm their calling by the effect; for this was a seal to approve their doctrine, seeing that God gave the Holy Spirit to those which believed. Forasmuch, as it appeared manifestly by this, that he allowed the faith of the gospel, and it was acceptable to him. In that they say <em>to those which obey him, </em>I refer it unto Christ, as if they should have said, those which believe in Christ are plentifully rewarded for their obedience. Therefore God will have Christ obeyed. Wherefore even our ministry doth please him in that thing. Yet here may a question be moved, Seeing that we have saith by the revelation of the Spirit, how is it said in this place, that the same is given after faith? I answer, that the gift of tongues, of prophecy, of interpretation, of healing, and such like, are spoken of in this place, wherewith God did beautiful his Church. As Paul saith, where he asketh the Galatians, whether they received the Spirit by the law, or by the hearing of faith, (<span class="bvs">Gal_3:2</span>.) Therefore the illumin-ation of the Spirit goeth before faith, because it is the cause thereof; but there follow other graces afterward, that we may go forward, according to that, “To him that hath shall be given,” (<span class="bvs">Mat_13:12</span>.) And if we will be enriched <em>every </em>now and then with new gifts of the Spirit, let us hold out unto God the lap of faith. <span class="cite-ref">(278)</span> But the reward wherewith our want of faith is rewarded at this day is far unlike; <span class="cite-ref">(279)</span> for the most part being destitute of the Spirit of God doth neither see nor understand anything. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(277)</span> “Tergiversari,” turn their back, backslide. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(278)</span> “Fidei sinum aperiamus Deo,” let us open a bosom of faith to God. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(279)</span> “Sed longe diversum praemium hodie reportat nostra incredulitas,” but our incredulity in the present day receiveth a very different recompence. </p></div></div>
