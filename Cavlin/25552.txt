Many had, no doubt, been slain in other places, and particularly at the time when that cruel fury, <span class="cite-ref">(282)</span> Jezebel, (<span class="bvs">1Kg_19:2</span>,) raged against them; but because in no other place had the <em>prophets, </em>at any time, been fiercely tormented, Christ justly brings this reproach against the ungodly inhabitants of the holy city. </p><p><em>It usually happened </em>that the prophets were slain there; because not only was it the source of all the ungodliness which spread over the whole of Judea, but it was also the field on which God trained his <em>prophets. </em><span class="cite-ref">(283)</span> We know that the more brightly the light of doctrine shines, so as to press more closely on wicked men, they are driven to a greater pitch of madness. What a dreadful example was it, that a place which had been chosen to be the sanctuary of divine worship, and the residence of the Law and of heavenly wisdom, should be polluted not by one or another murder,, but by a regular butchery of the <em>prophets </em>! It undoubtedly shows how obstinate is the rebellion of the world in rejecting sound doctrine. </p><p>The exclamation which immediately follows in Luke, (<span class="bvs">Luk_13:34</span>,) appears to be connected in such a manner, as if Christ had taken occasion from the present occurrence to inveigh, at this time, against <em>Jerusalem </em>But for my own part, I rather think, that Luke, having said that <em>Jerusalem </em>had been formerly stained by the blood of the <em>prophets, </em>nay, had been, through an uninterrupted succession of many ages, the slaughter-place, where the prophets were cruelly and wickedly put to death, immediately inserts, according to his custom, a statement which harmonized with that discourse. We have seen, on former occasions, that it is by no means unusual with him to introduce into one place a collection of Christ’s sayings, which were uttered at various times. </p><p><strong>(282)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Cette cruelle diablesse</span>;” — “that cruel female devil.” </p><p><strong>(283)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Auquel Dieu a voulu que ses Prophetes ayent soustenu de grans combats et rudes alarmes</span>;” — “on which God determined that his Prophets should sustain powerful combats and fierce alarms.” </p></div>
