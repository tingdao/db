<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_14:24</span><strong>.</strong><em>This is my blood. </em>I have already remarked that, when we are told that <em>the blood is to be shed </em>—according to the narrative of Matthew — <em>for the remission of sins, </em>these words direct us to the sacrifice of the death of Christ, without the remembrance of which the Lord’s Supper is never observed in a proper manner. And, indeed, it is impossible for believing souls to be satisfied in any other way than by being assured that God is pacified towards them. </p><p><em>Which is shed for many. </em>By the word <em>many </em>he means not a part of the world only, but the whole human race; for he contrasts many with one; as if he had said, that he will not be the Redeemer of one man only, but will die in order to deliver <em>many </em>from the condemnation of the curse. It must at the same time be observed, however, that by the words <em>for you, </em>as related by Luke — Christ directly addresses the disciples, and exhorts every believer to apply to his own advantage <em>the shedding of blood </em>Therefore, when we approach to the holy table, let us not only remember in general that the world has been redeemed by the blood of Christ, but let every one consider for himself that his own sins have been expiated. <span class="cite-ref">(197)</span></p><p><em>Of the new testament. </em>Luke and Paul (<span class="bvs">1Co_11:25</span>) express it differently, <em>the new testament in my blood, </em>but the meaning is the same; for it is only by a spiritual drinking of <em>blood </em>that this <em>covenant </em>is ratified, so as to be firm and stable. Yet it may easily be inferred from it, how foolishly superstitious the <em>Papists </em>and others of the same stamp are in rigidly adhering to the words; for, with all their bluster, they cannot set aside this exposition of the Holy Spirit, that <em>the cup </em>is called <em>blood, </em>because <em>it is the new testament in blood</em>. But the same argument applies to the <em>bread; </em>from which it will follow that it is called <em>the body; </em>because it is <em>the testament in the body </em>They have no right now to contend that we ought to rely on the simple words of Christ, and shut our ears against expositions from without. It is Christ himself that speaks, and surely they will not deny that he is well qualified to interpret his own words. Now Christ openly declares that he called the <em>bread his body</em>, for no other reason than because he has made with us an everlasting covenant, that, the sacrifice having been once offered, we may now be spiritually fed. </p><p>There are two things here which deserve our attention; for from the word <em>testament, </em>or <em>covenant, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">διαθήκη</span>,) we infer that a promise is included in the Holy Supper. This refutes the error of those who maintain that faith is not aided, nourished, supported, or increased by the sacraments; for there is always a mutual relation between the <em>covenant </em>of God and the faith of men. By the epithet <em>New </em>he intended to show that the ancient figures now cease, and give way to a firm and everlasting covenant. There is an indirect contrast, therefore, between this mystery and the shadows of the law; from which it is evident how much better our condition is than that of our fathers, since, in consequence of the sacrifice which was completed on the cross, we possess the truth in perfection. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(197)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que la purgation de ses pechez a esté faite</span>;” — “that satisfaction has been made for his own sins.” </p></div></div>
