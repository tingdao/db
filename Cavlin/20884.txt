<div class="comment-content"><p>He says next, <em>that their mother lay down among lions</em>, alluding to the people’s origin from lions, as we said before, when the Prophet calls Judea the descendant of Canaan, and the sister of Sodom and Samaria. When he now says, <em>their mother lay down among lions</em>, he means that they were shamefully mixed with the corruption of the Gentiles, so that they did not differ from them. But God had chosen them as his peculiar people on the very condition of being separate from all the filth of the Gentiles. There was, therefore, a certain withdrawing of God’s favor <em>when the mother of the people lay down among the lions, </em>that is, when they all promiscuously gave themselves up to the perverse morals and superstitions of the Gentiles. He says, <em>that she brought up whelps</em>, or young lions, which she produced to these lions; since their origin was impure, being all Abraham’s children, but, as I have said, a degenerate race. He afterwards adds, <em>that the lion’s whelp</em>, or young lion, <em>grew up till it became a lion: then it learnt to seize prey</em>, says he, and<em>to devour men</em>. He refers to King Jehoahaz, son of Josiah, (<span class="bvs">2Kg_23:30</span> :) but he had before asserted that the whole people had a lion’s disposition, and that the princes, who were more exalted, were like whelps. As only one lion is here brought forward, it ought to be referred to the violence by which that wicked king manifested his real disposition. But if it be asked whence the lion went forth, the reply is, from amidst his brethren, for they were all lions’ whelps, or young lions. They could not administer the government either together or singly, but each devoured his brother, and was devoted to robbery and rapine. The king only, because freed from all fear, could surpass the rest in rapine and robbery with impunity. We see, then, that not only the king was here condemned, but that he becomes the type of the whole nation; because, since no one could restrain his passions, he could rob and devour mankind with unbridled freedom. </p></div>
