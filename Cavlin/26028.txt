<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>Jesus himself stood in the midst of them. </em>While the Evangelist John copiously details the same narrative, (<span class="bvs">Joh_20:19</span>,) he differs from Luke in some circumstances. Mark, too, differs somewhat in his brief statement. As to John, since he only collects what Luke omitted, both may be easily reconciled. There is no contradiction about the substance of the fact; unless some person were to raise a debate about the time: for it is there said that Jesus entered in the evening, while it is evident, from the thread of the narrative, that he appeared at a late hour in the night, when the disciples had returned from Emmaus. But I do not think it right to insist precisely on the hour of the evening. On the contrary, we may easily and properly extend to a late hour of the night what is here said, and understand it to mean that Christ came to them after the evening, when the apostles had shut the doors, and kept themselves concealed within the house. In short, John does not describe the very commencement of the night, but simply means that, when the day was past, and after sunset, and even at the dead hour of night, Christ came to the disciples contrary to their expectation. </p><p>Still there arises here another question, since Mark and Luke relate that <em>the eleven </em>were assembled, when Christ appeared to them; and John says that Thomas was then absent, (<span class="bvs">Joh_20:24</span>.) But there is no absurdity in saying that the number — <em>the eleven </em>— is here put for the apostles themselves, though one of their company was absent. We have lately stated—and the fact makes it evident—that John enters into the details with greater distinctness, because it was his design to relate what the others had omitted. Besides, it is beyond a doubt that the three Evangelists relate the same narrative; since John expressly says that it was only twice that Christ appeared to his disciples at Jerusalem, before they went to Galilee; for he says that <em>he appeared to them the third time at the sea of Tiberias, </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_21:1</span>) He had already described two appearances of our Lord, one which took place on the day after his resurrection, (<span class="bvs">Joh_20:19</span>,) and the other which followed eight days afterwards, (<span class="bvs">Joh_20:26</span>) though, were any one to choose rather to explain the second appearance to be that which is found in the Gospel by Mark, I should not greatly object. </p><p>I now return to the words of Luke. He does not, indeed, say that Christ, by his divine power, opened for himself <em>the doors which were shut, </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_20:26</span>;) but something of this sort is indirectly suggested by the phrase which he employs, <em>Jesus stood. </em>For how could our Lord suddenly, during the night, <em>stand in the midst of them, </em>if he had not entered in a miraculous manner? The same form of salutation is employed by both, <em>Peace be to you; </em>by which the Hebrews mean, that for the person whom they address they wish happiness and prosperity. </p></div>
