<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>And the peace of God</em>. He gives the name of the <em>peace of God </em>to that which God has established among us, as will appear from what follows. He would have it <em>reign </em>in our hearts. <span class="cite-ref">(445)</span> He employs, however, a very appropriate metaphor; for as among wrestlers, <span class="cite-ref">(446)</span> he who has vanquished all the others carries off the palm, so he would have the <em>peace of God </em>be superior to all carnal affections, which often hurry us on to contentions, disagreements, quarrels, secret grudges. He accordingly prohibits us from giving loose reins to corrupt affections of this kind. As, however it is difficult to restrain them, he points out also the remedy, that the <em>peace of God </em>may carry the victory, because it must be a bridle, by which carnal affections may be restrained. Hence he says, <em>in our hearts; </em>because we constantly feel <em>there </em>great conflicts, while the <em>flesh lusteth against the Spirit</em>. (<span class="bvs">Gal_5:17</span>.) </p><p>The clause, <em>to which ye are called</em>, intimates what manner of <em>peace </em>this is — that unity which Christ has consecrated among us under his own direction. <span class="cite-ref">(447)</span> For God has <em>reconciled us to himself </em>in Christ, (<span class="bvs">2Co_5:18</span>,) with this view, that we may live in entire harmony among ourselves. He adds, <em>in one body</em>, meaning by this, that we cannot be in a state of agreement with God otherwise than by being united among ourselves as members of one body. When he bids us be <em>thankful</em>, I do not take this as referring so much to the remembrance of favors, as to sweetness of manners. Hence, with the view of removing ambiguity, I prefer to render it, “Be amiable.” At the same time I acknowledge that, if gratitude takes possession of our minds, <span class="cite-ref">(448)</span> we shall without fail be inclined to cherish mutual affection among ourselves. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(445)</span> “Rule in your hearts, (<span class="lang el-gr">βραβεύετο</span>.) Let the peace of Christ judge, decide, and govern in your hearts, as the brabeus, or judge, does in the Olympic contests... While peace rules, all is safe.” — Dr. A.
