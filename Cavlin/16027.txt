<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>128.</strong><em>Therefore I have esteemed all thy commandments to be altogether right </em><span class="cite-ref">(7)</span> This verse, like the preceding, is connected with the 26<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, and the connection may be brought out by observing, that the Prophet, waiting patiently for God’s judgments, and also earnestly calling for their infliction, had subscribed to the law of God in every particular, and embraced it without a single exception — and moreover, that he hated every false way. Literally, it is <em>all the commandments of all; </em>but the words <em>of all </em>are to be referred to things and not to persons, as if he had said, that he approved of all the laws which God had ordained, whatever they enjoined. <span class="cite-ref">(8)</span> A similar form of expression occurs in <span class="bvs">Eze_44:30</span>, “all oblations of all things” — that is to say, whatever kind of oblations men offer. The Prophet has not laid down this sentiment in such express terms without good reason; for there is nothing to which we are naturally more inclined than to despise or reject whatever in God’s law is not agreeable to us. Every man, according as he is tainted with this or that particular vice, would desire their the commandment which forbids it were razed out of the law. But we cannot lawfully make any addition to it, or take away anything from it; and since God has joined his commandments together by a sacred and inviolable bond, to separate any one of them from the rest is altogether unwarrantable. We perceive then how the Prophet, inspired with a holy jealousy for the law, contended against the wicked rebellion of those who despised it. And assuredly, when we see that the ungodly mock God with such effrontery, at one time rising up audaciously against him, trod at another perverting every part of the law, it becomes us to be the more inflamed with zeal, and to be the more courageous in maintaining the truth of God. The extreme impiety of our age especially demands of all the faithful that they should exercise themselves in this holy zeal. Profane men strive to outdo one another in scornfully aspersing the doctrine of salvation, and endeavor to bring God’s sacred Word into contempt by their derisive jeers. Others pour forth their blasphemies without intermission. We cannot, therefore, avoid being chargeable with the crime of treacherous indifference, if our hearts are not warmed with zeal, and unless we burn with a holy jealousy. The Prophet not merely says, that he approved of God’s law wholly and without exception, but he adds, <em>that he hated every way of lying, </em>or <em>every false way. </em>And, undoubtedly, no one subscribes in good earnest to the law of God, but he who rejects all the slanders by which the wicked taint or obscure the purity of sound doctrine. <em>By way of lying, </em>the Prophet doubtless means whatever is opposed to the purity of the law, intimating that he detested all corruption’s which are contrary to the Word of God. </p><p><strong>(7)</strong> Durell translates this verse — “For, as much as I esteem all thy precepts, etc., therefore I hate,” etc. </p><p><strong>(8)</strong> “<em>All the precepts of everything, i.e., </em>all precepts concerning all things. I embrace thy revealed Word, without any exceptions. The Psalmist states, that he had most diligently applied his mind to the consideration of all God’s commandments, the circumstances and occasions on which they were given, and he observed that they abounded in justice and holiness. Since, therefore, they are all equally just and holy, whatsoever is contrary to them he regarded as unjust, impure, false and detestable. Hammond remarks, that ‘the reduplication of the universal particle <span class="lang he-il">כל</span> is emphatic <em>all, even all; </em>’ and so the plain rendering is most current, <em>all thy commandments, even all, </em>have I approved.” — <em>Phillips. </em></p></div>
