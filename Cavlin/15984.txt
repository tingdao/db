<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>85</strong><em>The proud </em><span class="cite-ref">(428)</span><em>have digged pits for me. </em>He complains that he had been circumvented by the frauds and artifices of his enemies; as if he had said, They have not only endeavored to injure me by open force and the violence of the sword, but have also maliciously sought to destroy me by snares and secret arts. The additional clause, <em>which thing is not according to thy Law, </em>is introduced as an argument, to excite God to exercise his mercy; for he is the more inclined to succor his servants, when he sees that the attempts made upon their welfare involve the violation of his own Law. At the same time, the Psalmist furnishes a proof of his own innocence, intimating that he had deserved no such treatment at their hands, and that whatever they practiced, he, notwithstanding, patiently kept himself under restraint; not attempting any thing which he knew to be contrary to the Divine Law. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(428)</span> “<span class="lang he-il">זדים</span>, <em>the proud</em>. The proud here, as well as in many other parts of Scripture, stands for <em>lawless</em>, <em>wicked men</em>. So the rendering of the LXX. Is <span class="lang el-gr">παράνομοι</span>; Vulg. <em>Iniqui </em>. The relative, <span class="lang he-il">אשר</span>, is referred to <span class="lang he-il">שיחות</span>, <em>pits</em>, by many persons, as Amyraldus, who thus paraphrases the latter part of the verse: ‘At retia illa, cum lege tua directe pugnant.’ Others make <span class="lang he-il">זדיש</span> the antecedent, of whom they consider the second hemistich as descriptive. <em>The proud</em>, <em>who have not acted according to thy Law</em>, <em>have dug pits for me</em>. The sense is more obvious, according to this latter exposition; for one does not see the force of the phrase, ‘digging pits,’ which <em>are not according </em>to God’s Law, as if pits might be dug which <em>are according </em>to it.” — <em>Phillips </em></p></div></div>
