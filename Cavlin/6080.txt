<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>And Joshua returned, </em>etc This verse is not inserted in its proper place, <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> for shortly after the end of the battle is added, and the punishment inflicted on the kings, which was subsequent to the battle. We are then told of the encampment in Makkedah, and at last, in the end of the chapter, the return to Gilgal, which was introduced at the beginning without regard to the order of time, is repeated. Hence the narrative of the flight and concealment of the kings is connected with the former transactions. For having been informed during the heat of the battle that they were hiding in a cave, Joshua, fearing that if he were to set about capturing them, the others might escape, prudently contented himself with ordering the mouth of the cave to be blocked up with large stones, and setting sentinels over them, that being thus shut up, as it were in prison, they might at a fit time be brought forth and put to death. Hence, too, it appears that the army of the enemy was very large, because although the Israelites pressed closely upon them in their flight, and the sun himself gave an additional period for slaying them, it was impossible, notwithstanding, to prevent numbers of them from escaping into fortified cities. The divine assistance afforded to the Israelites was, however, sufficiently attested by the fact that they continued till they were wearied slaying at will all whom they met, and then returned safe. For the expression, that no one dared to move the tongue, implies that the Israelites gained a bloodless victory, <span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> as if they had gone forth not to fight, but merely to slay. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(100)</span> It is altogether omitted in the Septuagint. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span> “A bloodless victory.” Latin, “Incruenta victoria.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">De la part des Israelites ils ont acquis la victoire sans qu’il leur ait couste la vie d’un seul homme</span>;” “On the part of the Israelites they gained the victory without its having cost them the life of a single man.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
