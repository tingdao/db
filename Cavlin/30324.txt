<div class="comment-content"><p><em>And boasteth great things</em>. The verb <span class="lang el-gr">μεγαλαυχεῖν</span> means to boast one’s self, or to vaunt. But James in this passage did not intend to reprove ostentation so much as to show that the tongue is the doer of great things; for in this last clause he applies the previous comparisons to his subject; and vain boasting is not suitable to the bridle and the helm. He then means that the tongue is endued with great power. </p><p>I have rendered what Erasmus has translated the <em>impetuosity</em>, the <em>inclination</em>, of the pilot or guide; for <span class="lang el-gr">ὁρμὴ</span> means desire. I indeed allow that among the Greeks it designates those lusts which are not subservient to reason. But here James simply speaks of the will of the pilot. </p></div>
