<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Him who knew no sin. </em>Do you observe, that, according to Paul, there is no return to favor with God, except what is founded on the sacrifice of Christ alone? Let us learn, therefore, to turn our views in that direction, whenever we desire to be absolved from guilt. He now teaches more clearly, what we adverted to above — that God is propitious to us, when he acknowledges us as righteous. For these two things are equivalent — that we are acceptable to God, and that we are regarded by him as righteous. </p><p>To <em>know no sin </em>is to be free from sin. He says, then, that Christ, while he was entirely exempt from sin, was <em>made sin for us. </em>It is commonly remarked, that <em>sin </em>here denotes an expiatory sacrifice for sin, and in the same way the Latin’s term it, <em>piaculum </em><span class="cite-ref">(566)</span> Paul, too, has in this, and other passages, borrowed this phrase from the Hebrews, among whom <span class="lang he-il">אשם</span> (<em>asham</em>) denotes an <em>expiatory sacrifice, </em>as well as an <em>offense </em>or <em>crime. </em><span class="cite-ref">(567)</span> But the signification of this word, as well as the entire statement, will be better understood from a comparison of both parts of the antithesis. <em>Sin </em>is here contrasted with <em>righteousness, </em>when Paul teaches us, that <em>we were made the righteousness of God, </em>on the ground of <em>Christ’s having been made sin. Righteousness, </em>here, is not taken to denote a quality or habit, but by way of imputation, on the ground of Christ’s righteousness being reckoned to have been received by us. What, on the other hand, is denoted by <em>sin? </em>It is the guilt, on account of which we are arraigned at the bar of God. As, however, the curse of the individual was of old cast upon the victim, so Christ’s condemnation was our absolution, and <em>with his stripes we are healed. </em>(<span class="bvs">Isa_53:5</span>.) </p><p><em>The righteousness of God in him </em>In the first place, the <em>righteousness of God </em>is taken here to denote — not that which is given us by God, but that which is approved of by him, as in <span class="bvs">Joh_12:43</span>, the <em>glory of God </em>means — that which is in estimation with him — the <em>glory of men </em>denotes the vain applause of the world. Farther, in <span class="bvs">Rom_3:23</span>, when he says, that we have <em>come short of the glory of God, </em>he means, that there is nothing that we can glory in before God, for it is no very difficult matter to appear righteous before men, but it is a mere delusive appearance of righteousness, which becomes at last the ground of perdition. Hence, <em>that </em>is the only true righteousness, which is acceptable to God. </p><p>Let us now return to the contrast between <em>righteousness </em>and <em>sin </em>How are we righteous in the sight of God? It is assuredly in the same respect in which Christ was a sinner. For he assumed in a manner our place, that he might be a criminal in our room, and might be dealt with as a sinner, not for his own offenses, but for those of others, inasmuch as he was pure and exempt from every fault, and might endure the punishment that was due to us — not to himself. It is in the same manner, assuredly, that we are now <em>righteous in him </em>— not in respect of our rendering satisfaction to the justice of God by our own works, but because we are judged of in connection with Christ’s righteousness, which we have put on by faith, that it might become ours. On this account I have preferred to retain the particle <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν,</span> (<em>in,</em>) rather than substitute in its place <em>per, </em>(<em>through,</em>)for that signification corresponds better with Paul’s intention. <span class="cite-ref">(568)</span></p><p><strong>(566)</strong> The Latin term <em>piaculum </em> is sometimes employed to denote <em>a crime requiring expiation</em>, and at other times, an <em>expiatory victim</em>. — Ed </p><p><strong>(567)</strong> Thus in <span class="bvs">Lev_5:6</span>, <span class="lang he-il">אשם</span>, (<em>asham</em>,) denotes a trespass-offering; and in the verse immediately following, it means an offense or trespass. See Calvin’s <em>Institutes</em>, volume 2. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(568)</strong> The force of the preposition <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν</span> (<em>in</em>,) as made use of by the Apostle in this passage, is more fully brought out by <em>Beza </em>in the following terms: “Justi apud Deum, et quidem justitia non nobis inh’rente, sed qu’, quum in Christo sit, nobis per fidem a Deo imputatur. Ideo enim additurn est : <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>Sic ergo sumus justitia Dei in ipso, ut ille est peccatum in nobis, nempe ex imputatione. Libet autem hic ex Augustino locum insignem exscribere, velut istius commentarium plenissimum. Sic igitur ille Serm. 5. de verbis Apostoli: <em>Deus Pater eum, qui non noverat peccatum </em>(nempe Iesum Christum) <em>peccatum effecit,ut nos simus justitia Dei </em>(non nostra) <em>in ipso </em>(non in nobis.) His adde<span class="bvs">Phi_3:9</span>;” — “Righteous before God, and that by a righteousness which is not inherent in us, but which, being in Christ, is imputed to us by God through faith. For it is on this account that it is added: <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> (<em>in him</em>.) We are, therefore, the righteousness of God in him in the same way as he is sin in us — by imputation. I may here quote a remarkable passage from Augustine, as a most complete commentary upon it. In Serm. 5 on the words of the Apostle he expresses himself thus: <em>God the Father made him sin who had not known sin</em>, (Jesus Christ,) <em>that we might be the righteousness of God </em>(not our own) <em>in him </em>(not in ourselves.) To these add <span class="bvs">Phi_3:9</span>.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
