<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>And he brought them forth with silver and gold </em><span class="cite-ref">(230)</span> The prophet, on the other hand, celebrates the grace of God which preserved the chosen people untouched and safe from all these plagues. If both parties had been indiscriminately afflicted with them, the hand of God would not have been so signally manifest. But now when the Israelites, amidst so many calamities, experienced an entire exemption from harm, this difference exhibits to us, as in a picture, God’s fatherly care about his own people. For this reason, it is stated, <em>Nor was there a feeble person, </em>or <em>one who stumbled; </em><span class="cite-ref">(231)</span> for the verb <span class="lang he-il">כשל</span><em>, kashal, </em>has both these meanings. But I prefer taking it simply in this sense, That whilst Egypt was hastening to destruction, the people of God were vigorous, and free from every malady. When it is said, <em>He brought them forth, </em>and when it is afterwards added, <em>in his tribes, </em>there is a change of the number, which is quite common in the Hebrew language. Some refer the word <em>his </em>to God; but this I am afraid is too forced. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(230)</span> Allusion is made to the Israelites carrying with them in their departure from Egypt, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, which they borrowed of the Egyptians, <span class="bvs">Exo_12:36</span>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(231)</span> “<em>And there was not any one stumbling among his tribes. </em>The LXX. have rendered <span class="lang he-il">כושל</span> by <span class="lang el-gr">ἀσθενης</span><em>infirm, </em>so that they understood the Psalmist to say, there was no one incapable of following the multitude, — no one was prevented by disease or infirmity from accomplishing the journey.” — <em>Phillips. </em>What a striking contrast between their condition and that of their oppressors! While in every Egyptian dwelling, death had left his victim, not one of all the children of Israel was unable to prosecute his heaven-directed flight from that land of bondage. </p></div></div>
