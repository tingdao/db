<div class="comment-content"><p>But he immediately after removes this ground of despair, and says, <em>Their redeemer is strong </em>He then sets this <em>strong, </em><span class="lang he-il">חזק</span>, <em>chesek, </em>in opposition to the verb used before, <em>“prevailed” </em>or ruled, <span class="lang he-il">החזיקו בם</span>, <em>echesiku beem, </em>“prevailed” or domineered “over them<em>, </em>” so that they were stronger. But now, on the other hand, he calls the <em>Redeemer of Israel strong; </em>for were you only to consider, he seems to say, how great the power of Babylon is, you might despond; but can God, in the meantime, do nothing? Is there any power on earth which can overrule him? Since then their redeemer was strong, he would prove superior to the Chaldeans. </p><p>He afterwards adds what is of the same import, <em>His name is Jehovah of hosts; </em>that is, neither Babylon nor all other nations have so much power as can resist the infinite power of God, for he is always like himself, and perfect; he is the God of hosts. He at length adds, <em>Their strife by litigating he will litigate, </em>or, by pleading he will plead the cause of his people, even so as to <em>cut off </em>or destroy <em>the land </em>The verb, <span class="lang he-il">רגע</span>, <em>rego, </em>means indeed sometimes to rest, and so almost all give this rendering, “so as to make to rest the land:” but as I take “land” and “the inhabitants of Babylon” to be the same, I doubt not but that this verb is to be taken here in its proper sense. Then it is, <em>so as to cut off or destroy the land, </em><span class="cite-ref">(71)</span><em>and to make to tremble the inhabitants of Babylon. H </em>e then speaks of the Chaldeans in mentioning the land, and afterwards explains himself by adding, the inhabitants of Babylon. </p><p><strong>(71)</strong> The versions, except the <em>Syr. </em>and the <em>Targ., </em>give a similar meaning to this verb: but there is no instance of the verb in Hiphil having this meaning, though it would be the most suitable to this place. At the same time we may consider the land of Chaldea to be meant, if we regard the stillness or quietness as referring to the check produced by God’s restraining power, — </p><p>So as to render the land still, <LineBreak />And to terrify the inhabitants of Babylon. </p><p>The promise is to make the land quiet so as not to oppose the return of the Jews, and for the same purpose, to terrify Babylon. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
