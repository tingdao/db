<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>I will call upon the praised Jehovah. </em>Calling upon God, as has been observed elsewhere, frequently comprehends the whole of his service; but as the effect or fruit of prayer is particularly mentioned in what follows, this phrase in the passage before us, I have no doubt, signifies to have recourse to God for protection, and to ask by prayer deliverance from him. David having said in the second verse, that he trusted in God, now subjoins this as an evidence of his trust; for every one who confides in God will earnestly beseech his aid in the time of need. He therefore declares, that he <em>will be saved, </em>and prove victorious over all <em>his enemies, </em>because he will have recourse to God for help. He calls God the <em>praised Jehovah, </em>not only to intimate that he is worthy of being praised, as almost all interpreters explain it, but also to point out, that, when he came to the throne of grace, his prayers would be mingled and interwoven with praises. <span class="cite-ref">(393)</span> The scope of the passage seems to require that it be understood as meaning, that giving thanks to God for the benefits which he has received from him in times past, he will ask his assistance by renewed supplications. And certainly no man will ever invoke God in prayer freely and frankly unless he animate and encourage himself by the remembrance of the grace of God. Accordingly Paul, in <span class="bvs">Phi_4:6</span>, exhorts the faithful </p><p>“in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, to make their requests known unto God” (<span class="bvs">Phi_4:6</span>) </p><p>and to disburden their cares, as it were, into his bosom. All those whose prayers are not accompanied with the praises of God are chargeable with clamouring and complaining against him, when engaged in that solemn exercise. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(393)</span> The word in the Hebrew text <span class="lang he-il">מהלל</span>, <em>mehullal, </em>literally signifies <em>praise. </em>The ancient versions view the word not as denoting that God is worthy to be praised, which is the meaning attached to it in our English version, but as referring to the Psalmist’s resolution to praise God. The Septuagint reads, <span class="lang el-gr">Αινων επικαλεσομαι Κυριον</span><em>Kytov, </em>“Praising I will call upon the Lord.” The reading of the Vulgate is the same, “Laudans invocabo.” The Chaldee reads, “In a song or hymn I pour out prayers unto the Lord:” and the Arabic. “I will praise the Lord, and call upon him.” This is precisely the sense in which Calvin understands the words, “I will call upon the praised Jehovah.” </p></div></div>
