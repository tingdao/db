<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>More to be desired are they than gold. </em>The Psalmist now exalts the law of God both on account of its price and sweetness. This commendation depends on the commendations given in the preceding verses; for the many and great advantages which he has just now enumerated, ought justly to make us account heavenly truth the highest and most excellent treasure, and to despise, when compared with it, all the gold and silver of the world. Instead of the word <em>fine gold, </em>which the Latins have called <em>Aurum obryzum, </em><span class="cite-ref">(458)</span> some render the Hebrew word <em>a jewel, </em>or <em>precious stones, </em><span class="cite-ref">(459)</span> but the other translation is more generally received, namely, <em>fine gold, </em>that is, gold which is pure and well refined in the furnace; and there are many passages of Scripture by which this rendering is confirmed. <span class="cite-ref">(460)</span> The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">פז</span>, <em>paz, </em>is derived from <span class="lang he-il">פזה</span>, <em>pazah, </em>which signifies <em>to strengthen; </em><span class="cite-ref">(461)</span> from which we may conjecture that the Psalmist does not mean the gold of any particular country, as if one should say the gold of Ophir, but gold completely refined and purified by art. So far is <span class="lang he-il">פז</span>, <em>paz, </em>from being derived from the name of a country, that, on the contrary, it appears from <span class="bvs">Jer_10:9</span>, that the land of Uphaz took its name from this Hebrew word, because it had in it mines of the finest gold. As to the origin of the word <em>obrizum, </em>which the Latins have used, we cannot say any thing with certainty, except that, according to the conjecture of Jerome, it signifies <em>brought from the land of Ophir, </em>as if it had been said, <em>aurum Ophrizum. </em>In short, the sense is, that we do not esteem the law as it deserves, if we do not prefer it to all the riches of the world. If we are once brought thus highly to prize the law, it will serve effectually to deliver our hearts from an immoderate desire of gold and silver. To this esteem of the law there must be added love to it, and delight in it, so that it may not only subdue us to obedience by constraint, but also allure us by its sweetness; a thing which is impossible, unless, at the same time, we have mortified in us the love of carnal pleasures, with which it is not wonderful to see us enticed and ensnared, so long as we reject, through a vitiated taste, the righteousness of God. From this we may again deduce another evidence, that David’s discourse is not to be understood simply of the commandments, and of the dead letter, but that he comprehends, at the same time, the promises by which the grace of God is offered to us. If the law did nothing else but command us, how could it be loved, since in commanding it terrifies us, because we all fail in keeping it? <span class="cite-ref">(462)</span> Certainly, if we separate the law from the hope of pardon, and from the Spirit of Christ, so far from tasting it to be sweet as honey, we will rather find in it a bitterness which kills our wretched souls. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(458)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lequel les Latins ont nomm, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Aurum obryzum </em><em>.” </em>—<em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(459)</span> The rendering of the Septuagint is, <span class="lang el-gr">λιθον τιμιον</span>, <em>precious stone; </em>and in <span class="bvs">Psa_119:127</span>, they translate the same Hebrew word, <span class="lang el-gr">τοπαζιον</span>, <em>a topaz, </em>which is a precious stone.
