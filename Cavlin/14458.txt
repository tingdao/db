<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Be silent to Jehovah. </em>The Psalmist continues the illustration of the same doctrine, namely, that we should patiently and meekly bear those things that usually disquiet our minds; for amid innumerable sources of disquietude and conflict there is need of no small patience. By the similitude of <em>silence, </em>which often occurs in the sacred writings, he declares most aptly the nature of faith; for as our affections rise in rebellion against the will of God, so faith, restoring us to a state of humble and peaceful submission, appeases all the tumults of our hearts. By this expression, <span class="cite-ref">(25)</span> therefore, David commands us not to yield to the tumultuous passions of the soul, as the unbelieving do, nor fretfully to set ourselves in opposition to the authority of God, but rather to submit peacefully to him, that he may execute his work in silence. Moreover, as the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">חול</span>, <em>chul, </em>which we have rendered <em>to wait, </em>sometimes signifies to <em>mourn, </em>and sometimes to <em>wait, </em>the word <span class="lang he-il">התחולל</span>, <em>hithcholel, </em>in this place is understood by some as meaning <em>to mourn moderately, </em>or <em>to bear sorrow patiently. </em>It might also be rendered more simply <em>to mourn before God, </em>in order that he might be a witness of all our sorrows; for when the unbelieving give way to doubt and suspense, they rather murmur against him than utter their complaints before him. As, however, the other interpretation is more generally received, namely, that David is exhorting us to hope and patience, I adhere to it. The prophet Isaiah also connects hope with silence in the same sense, (<span class="bvs">Isa_30:15</span>.) </p><p>David next repeats what he had said in the first verse, <em>Fret not because of the man who prospereth in his way, </em>or who brings his ways to a happy issue; nor <em>against the man who behaveth himself wickedly, </em>or <em>who accomplishes his devices </em>Of these two interpretations of this last clause, the latter is more in accordance with the scope of the psalm. I confess, indeed, that the word <span class="lang he-il">מזמות</span><em>mezimmoth, </em>is commonly taken in a bad sense for fraud and stratagem. But as <span class="lang he-il">זמם</span><em>zamam, </em>sometimes signifies in general <em>to meditate</em>, the nature of the Hebrew language will bear this meaning, that <em>to execute his devices </em>is of the same import as to effect what he has purposed. Now we see that these two things are connected, namely <em>to dispose his ways according to his desires, </em>or <em>to prosper in his way, </em>and <em>to accomplish his devices </em>It is a very great temptation to us and difficult to bear, when we see fortune smiling upon the ungodly, as if God approved of their wickedness; nay, it excites our wrath and indignation. David, therefore, not contented with a short admonition, insists at some length upon this point. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(25)</span> The Hebrew verb rendered <em>silent </em>is <span class="lang he-il">דום</span>, <em>dom</em>, from which the English word <em>dumb </em>appears to be derived. The silence here enjoined is opposed to murmuring or complaining. The word is rendered by the Septuagint, <span class="lang el-gr">ὑποταγνθι</span>, <em>be subject</em>; which is not an exact translation of the original term: but it well expresses the meaning; for this silence implies the entire subjection of ourselves to the will of God. </p></div></div>
