<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And if I go away. </em>The conditional term, <em>if</em>, ought to be interpreted as an adverb of time; as if it had been said, “After that <em>I have gone away</em>, <em>I will return to you again</em>. ” This <em>return </em>must not be understood as referring to the Holy Spirit, as if Christ had manifested to the disciples some new presence of himself by the Spirit. It is unquestionably true, that Christ dwells with us and in us by his Spirit; but here he speaks of the last day of judgment, when he will, at length, come to assemble his followers. And, indeed, if we consider the whole body of the Church, he every day <em>prepares a place </em>for us; whence it follows, that the proper time for our entrance into heaven is not yet come. </p></div>
