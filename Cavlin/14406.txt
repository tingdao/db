<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>They </em><span class="cite-ref">(700)</span><em>cried, and Jehovah heard them. </em>The Psalmist’s meaning is, that they are heard as often as they cry. This is a doctrine applicable to all times; and David does not merely relate what God has done once or twice, but what he is accustomed to do. It is also a confirmation of the preceding sentence, where he had said that the ears of the Lord are open to the cry of the righteous; for he now demonstrates by the effect, that God is not deaf when we lay our complaints and groanings before him. By the word <em>cry </em>we are taught, that although God defend the righteous, they are not exempt from adversity. He regulates the protection which he affords them in such a wonderful manner, as that he notwithstanding exercises them by various trials. In like manner, when we here see that deliverance is promised only to those who call upon God, this ought to prove no small encouragement to us to pray to him; for it is not his will that the godly should so regard his providence as to indulge in idleness, but rather that, being firmly persuaded that he is the guardian of their safety, they should direct their prayers and supplications to him. </p><p><strong>(700)</strong> It is wicked men who are spoken of in the immediately preceding verse; but <em>they </em>here evidently refers not to them, but to the righteous, mentioned in the fifteenth verse; and, accordingly, in all the ancient versions, and in our English Bible, the words <em>the righteous </em>are supplied. It is supposed by those who make this supplement, that the word <span class="lang he-il">צדיקים</span>, <em>tsaddikim, </em>has been lost out of the text. But if we read the 16<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse as a parenthesis, it will not be necessary to make any supplement, and the words may be read exactly as they are in the Hebrew, <em>They cried. </em></p></div>
