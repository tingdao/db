<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Say I these things as a man </em>? Lest any one should cavil, and say that in the things of the Lord the case is different, and therefore that he had to no purpose brought forward so many comparisons, he now adds, that the very same thing is commanded by the Lord. To speak <em>as a man </em>sometimes means — speaking according to the perverse judgment of the flesh, (as in <span class="bvs">Rom_3:5</span>.) Here, however, it means — bringing forward only those things that are in common use among men, and are merely current (as they speak) in a human court. Now, that God himself designed that the labors of men should be remunerated by wages, he proves from this, that he prohibits the <em>muzzling of the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn; </em>and with the view of applying it to the subject in hand, he says, that God was not <em>concerned </em>as to oxen, but rather had regard to men. </p><p>In the first place, it may be asked, Why has he more particularly selected this proof, while he had in the law passages that were much clearer? as for example, <span class="bvs">Deu_24:15</span>, </p><p>The wages of the hireling shall not remain with thee over night. </p><p>If any one, however, will take a nearer view, he will acknowledge that there is more force in this quotation, in which the Lord requires cattle to be taken care of, for from this it is inferred, from the less to the greater, how much equity he requires among men, when he wishes that it should be shown to brute animals. When he says, that <em>God does not take care for oxen</em>, you are not to understand him as meaning to exclude oxen from the care of God’s Providence, inasmuch as he does not overlook even the least sparrow. (<span class="bvs">Mat_6:26</span>, and <span class="bvs">Mat_10:29</span>.) Nor is it as if he meant to expound that precept allegorically, as some hair-brained spirits take occasion from this to turn everything into allegories. Thus they turn dogs into men, trees into angels, and turn all scripture into a laughing-stock. </p><p>Paul’s meaning is simple — that, when the Lord enjoins humanity to oxen, he does not do it for the sake of oxen, but rather from a regard to men, on whose account, too, the very oxen were created. That compassion, therefore, towards oxen should be a stimulus to us to stir up to the exercise of humanity among us, as Solomon says, (<span class="bvs">Pro_12:10</span>,) </p><p>The righteous man hath a care over his beast, <LineBreak />but the bowels of the wicked are cruel. </p><p>Let it then be understood by you, that God is not <em>so </em>concerned for oxen, as to have had merely a regard to oxen in making that law, for he had mankind in view, and wished to accustom them to equity, that they might not defraud the workman of his hire. For it is not the ox that has the principal part in plowing or treading out the corn, but man, by whose industry the ox himself is set to work. Hence, what he immediately adds — He <em>that ploweth, should plow in hope</em>, etc. is an exposition of the precept, as if he had said, that it extends generally to any kind of recompense for labor. </p></div>
