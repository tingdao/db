<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Neither let us tempt Christ </em>This part of the exhortation refers to the history that is recorded in <span class="bvs">Num_21:6</span>. For the people, having become weary of the length of time, began to complain of their condition, and to expostulate with God — “Why has God deceived us,” etc. This murmuring of the people Paul speaks of as a <em>tempting</em>; and not without good reason, for <em>tempting </em>is opposed to patience. What reason was there at that time why the people should rise up against God, except this — that, under the influence of base desire, <span class="cite-ref">(551)</span> they could not wait in patience the arrival of the time appointed by the Lord? Let us, therefore, take notice, that the fountain of that evil against which Paul here warns us is impatience, when we wish to go before God, and do not give ourselves up to be ruled by Him, but rather wish to bind him to our inclination and laws. This evil God severely punished in the Israelitish people. Now he remains always like himself — a just Judge. Let us therefore not <em>tempt </em>him, if we would not have experience of the same punishment. </p><p>This is a remarkable passage in proof of the eternity of Christ; for the cavil of Erasmus has no force — “Let us not tempt Christ, as some of them tempted <em>God</em>; ” for to supply the word <em>God </em>is extremely forced. <span class="cite-ref">(552)</span> Nor is it to be wondered that Christ is called the Leader of the Israelitish people. For as God was never propitious to his people except through that Mediator, so he conferred no benefit except through his hand. Farther, the angel who appeared at first to Moses, and was always present with the people during their journeying, is frequently called <span class="lang he-il">יהוה</span>, Jehovah. <span class="cite-ref">(553)</span> Let us then regard it as a settled point, that that angel was the Son of God, and was even then the guide of the Church of which he was the Head. As to the term <em>Christ</em>, from its having a signification that corresponds with his human nature, it was not as yet applicable to the Son of God, but it is assigned to him by the communication of properties, as we read elsewhere, that </p><p>the Son of Man came down from heaven. (<span class="bvs">Joh_3:13</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(551)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vn desir importun et desordonne</span>;” — “An importunate and inordinate desire.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(552)</span> Billroth, in his’Commentary on the Epistles to the Corinthians, alleges, that the view that is here taken by Calvin “could have been suggested only by reasons of a dogmarital character.” The objection thus brought forward, however, is satisfactorily set aside in a valuable note by Dr. Alexander, in his translation of Billroth.
