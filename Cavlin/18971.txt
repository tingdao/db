<div class="comment-content"><p>Then follows the charge: <em>What, iniquity have your fathers found in me</em>, that having forsaken <em>me they should walk after vanity and become vain? </em>Here Jeremiah charges the people with two crimes, — that they had departed from the true God, whom they had found to be a deliverer, — and that they had become vain in their devices; or, in other words, that they were become for no reason apostates: for their sin was enhanced, because there had been no occasion given them to forsake God, and to alienate themselves from him. As then God had kindly treated them, and they themselves had shaken off the yoke, and as there was no one whom they could compare with God, they could not have said, “We have been <em>deceived, </em>” — how so? “<em>For ye have, </em>he says, <em>followed vanity; </em>and vanity alone was the reason why ye have departed from me.” <span class="cite-ref">(29)</span> I wish I could proceed farther; but I have some business to which I was called even before the lecture. </p><p><strong>(29)</strong> The literal rendering of this verse is as follows, — </p><p><strong>5.</strong>Thus saith Jehovah, What have your fathers found in me? Oppression? For they have gone far from me, And have followed after vanity, And have become vain. </p><p>The word <span class="lang he-il">שול</span>, oppression, injustice, or tyranny, is so placed in the sentence that it cannot be construed with “what.” The word “vanity” means often an idol, and it is so considered here by the <em>Targum, </em>by <em>Piscator, Grotius, Gataker, </em>and others. It is often found in the plural, “vanities,” as it is here in the <em>Septuagint; </em>see <span class="bvs">Deu_32:21</span>; <span class="bvs">1Kg_16:26</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_31:6</span> : but it is here the poetical singular. They “became vain,” that is, foolish, sottish, having no more sense or reason than their idols, as idolaters are represented in <span class="bvs">Psa_115:8</span>. Their senselessness is set forth in the next verse. An idol is especially called “vanity,” because it can do no good and avails nothing: deluded imagination alone gives it all its efficacy and power. Samuel gives a true account of idols, <span class="bvs">1Sa_12:21</span>. But as long as the devil deceives and deludes the world, idols and images will be in repute, though they are in themselves wholly useless and worthless, while yet they prove ruinous to the souls of men. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
