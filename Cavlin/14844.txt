<div class="comment-content"><p>In the words which follow, David expresses his consequent resolution to praise God. When we experience his goodness, we are led to open our lips in thanksgiving. His intention is intimated still more clearly in the succeeding verse, where he says that <em>he will bless God in his life </em>There is some difficulty, however, in ascertaining the exact sense of the words. When it is said, So <em>will I bless thee, </em>etc., the <em>so </em>may refer to the good reason which he had, as just stated, to praise God, from having felt how much better it is to live by life communicated from God, than to live of and from ourselves. <span class="cite-ref">(430)</span> Or the sense may be, <em>so, </em>that is, <em>even in this calamitous and afflicted condition: </em>for he had already intimated that, amidst the solitude of the wilderness, where he wandered, he would still direct his eye to God. The word <em>life, </em>again, may refer to his life as having been preserved by divine interposition; or the sense of the passage may be, that he would bless God <em>through the course of his life. </em>The former meaning conveys the fullest matter of instruction, and agrees with the context; he would bless God, because, by his goodness, he had been kept alive and in safety. The sentiment is similar to that which we find elsewhere, </p><p>“I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord;” — (<span class="bvs">Psa_118:17</span>) </p><p>and again; — </p><p>“The dead shall not praise the Lord, neither any that go down into silence, but we who live will bless the Lord,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_115:17</span>.) </p><p>In the <em>lifting up of hands, </em><span class="cite-ref">(431)</span> in the second clause of the verse, allusion is made to praying and vowing; and he intimates, that besides giving thanks to God, he would acquire additional confidence in supplication, and be diligent in the exercise of it. Any experience we may have of the divine goodness, while it stirs us up to gratitude, should, at the same time, strengthen our hopes of the future, and lead us confidently to expect that God will perfect the grace which he has begun. Some understand by the <em>lifting up of his hands, </em>that he refers to praising the Lord. Others, that he speaks of encouraging himself from the divine assistance, and boldly encountering his enemies. But I prefer the interpretation which has been already given. </p><p><strong>(430)</strong> “Melius esse nobis vivificari ab ipso quam apud nos vivere.” </p><p><strong>(431)</strong> “The practice of lifting up the hands in prayer towards heaven, the supposed residence of the object to which prayer is addressed, was anciently used, both by believers, as appears from various passages in the Old Testament, and by the heathen, agreeably to numerous instances in the classical writers. Parkhurst, considering the ‘hand’ to be the chief organ or instrument of man’s power and operations, and properly supposing the word to be thence used very extensively by the Hebrews for power, agency, dominion, assistance, and the like, regards the lifting up of men’s hands in prayer as an emblematical acknowledging of the <em>power</em>, and imploring of the <em>assistance </em>of their respective gods. Is it not, however, rather the natural and unstudied gesture of earnest supplication?” — <em>Mant</em>. </p></div>
