<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Giving thanks. </em>Again he returns to thanksgiving, that he may take this opportunity of enumerating the blessings which had been conferred upon them through Christ, and thus he enters upon a full delineation of Christ. For this was the only remedy for fortifying the Colossians against all the snares, by which the false Apostles endeavored to entrap them — to understand accurately what Christ was. For how comes it that we are <em>carried about with so many strange doctrines</em>, (<span class="bvs">Heb_13:9</span>) but because the excellence of Christ is not perceived by us? For Christ alone makes all other things suddenly vanish. Hence there is nothing that Satan so much endeavors to accomplish as to bring on mists with the view of obscuring Christ, because he knows, that by this means the way is opened up for every kind of falsehood. This, therefore, is the only means of retaining, as well as restoring pure doctrine — to place Christ before the view such as he is with all his blessings, that his excellence may be truly perceived. </p><p>The question here is not as to the name. Papists in common with us acknowledge one and the same Christ; yet in the mean time how great a difference there is between us and them, inasmuch as they, after confessing Christ to be the Son of God, transfer his excellence to others, and scatter it hither and thither, and thus leave him next to empty, <span class="cite-ref">(292)</span> or at least rob him of a great part of his glory, so that he is called, it is true, by them the Son of God, but, nevertheless, he is not such as the Father designed he should be towards us. If, however, Papists would cordially embrace what is contained in this chapter, we would soon be perfectly agreed, but the whole of Popery would fall to the ground, for it cannot stand otherwise than through ignorance of Christ. This will undoubtedly be acknowledged by every one that will but consider the main article <span class="cite-ref">(293)</span> of this first chapter; for his grand object here is that we may know that Christ is the beginning, middle, and end — that it is from him that all things must be sought — that nothing is, or can be found, apart from him. Now, therefore, let the readers carefully and attentively observe in what colors Paul depicts Christ to us. </p><p><em>Who hath made us meet. </em>He is still speaking of the <em>Father</em>, because he is the beginning, and efficient cause (as they speak) of our salvation. As the term <em>God </em>is more distinctly expressive of majesty, so the term <em>Father </em>conveys the idea of clemency and benevolent disposition. It becomes us to contemplate both as existing in God, that his majesty may inspire us with fear and reverence, and that his fatherly love may secure our full confidence. Hence it is not without good reason that Paul has conjoined these two things, if, after all, you prefer the rendering which the old interpreter has followed, and which accords with some very ancient Greek manuscripts. <span class="cite-ref">(294)</span> At the same time there will be no inconsistency in saying, that he contents himself with the single term, <em>Father. </em>Farther, as it is necessary that his incomparable grace should be expressed by the term <em>Father</em>, so it is also not less necessary that we should, by the term <em>God</em>, be roused up to admiration of so great goodness, that he, who is God, has condescended thus far. <span class="cite-ref">(295)</span></p><p>But for what kindness does he give thanks to God? For his having <em>made </em>him, and others,<em>meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints. </em>For we are born children of wrath, exiles from God’s kingdom. It is God’s adoption that alone <em>makes us meet</em>. Now, adoption depends on an unmerited election. The Spirit of regeneration is the seal of adoption. He adds, <em>in light, </em>that there might be a contrast — as opposed to the darkness of Satan’s kingdom. <span class="cite-ref">(296)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(292)</span> ”<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils le laissent quasi vuide et inutile</span>;” — “They leave him in a manner empty and useless.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(293)</span><em>Statum </em> The term is commonly employed among the Latins like <span class="lang el-gr">στάσις</span> among the Greeks, to mean the point at issue.
