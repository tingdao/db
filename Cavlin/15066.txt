<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Thou hast fixed </em><span class="cite-ref">(241)</span><em>all the boundaries of the earth. </em>What is here stated concerning the boundaries or limits assigned to the earth, and concerning the regular and successive recurrence of summer and winter every year, is to the same effect as the preceding verse. It is doubtful whether the prophet means the uttermost ends of the world, or whether he speaks of the particular boundaries by which countries are separate from each other. Although the latter are often disturbed by the violence of men, whose insatiable cupidity and ambition cannot be restrained by any of the lines of demarcation which exist in the world, but are always endeavoring to break through them; <span class="cite-ref">(242)</span> yet God manifests his singular goodness in assigning to each nation its own territory upon which to dwell. I am, however, rather of opinion, that the clause is to be understood of those bounds which cannot be confounded at the will of men, and consider the meaning to be, that God has allotted to men as much space of earth as he has seen to be sufficient for them to dwell upon. Farther, the well regulated successions of summer and winter clearly indicate with what care and benignity God has provided for the necessities of the human family. From this, the prophet justly concludes, that nothing is more improbable than that God should neglect to act the part of a father towards his own flock and household. </p><p><strong>(241)</strong> The original word implies “to settle, to place steadily in a certain situation or place.” See <em>Parkhurst </em>’<em>s Lexicon on </em><span class="lang he-il">יצב</span></p><p><strong>(242)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Entant que leur cupidite et ambition insatiable ne pent estre retenue par quelque separation qu’il y ait, mais tasche tousjours d’enjamber par dessus</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
