<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>All thy garments smell of myrrh </em>As to the signification of the words I am not disposed to contend much, for I find that even the Jews are not agreed among themselves as to the meaning of the third word, except that from the similarity of pronunciation it may be conjectured to denote cassia. It is sufficient that we understand the prophet as meaning that the garments of the king are perfumed with precious and sweet-smelling odours. He describes Solomon coming forth from his ivory palace amidst shoutings of universal applause and joy. I explain not the word <span class="lang he-il">מני</span>, <em>minni, Out of me, </em>because no tolerable meaning can be drawn from this. I translate it <em>whence, </em><span class="cite-ref">(165)</span> and refer it to the <em>ivory palaces </em>Superfluity and excess in pleasures cannot be justified, not only in the common people, but not even in kings; yet, on the other hand, it is necessary to guard against too much austerity, that we may not condemn the moderate display of grandeur which is suitable to their dignity, even as, a little after, the prophet describes the queen sumptuously and royally apparelled. <span class="cite-ref">(166)</span> We must, however, at the same time, consider that all that is here commended in Solomon was not approved of by God. Not to speak of other things, it is well known that from the very first the sin of polygamy was a thing displeasing to God, and yet concubines are here spoken of as included among the blessings of God, for there is no reason to doubt that by <em>the honorable women, </em>or <em>maids of honor, </em><span class="cite-ref">(167)</span> the prophet means Solomon’s wives, of whom mention is made in another place. The daughter of the king of Egypt, whom Solomon had married, was his principal wife, and the first in rank <span class="cite-ref">(168)</span> but it appears that the others, whom sacred history describes as occupying an inferior rank, were provided for in a liberal and honorable manner. These the prophet calls the <em>daughters of kings, </em>because some of them were descended of the royal blood. In what sense, then, it might be asked, does the prophet account it among the praises of Solomon that he had many wives, — a thing which God condemns in all private <em>persons, </em>but expressly in kings? (<span class="bvs">Deu_17:17</span>.) Doubtless it may easily be inferred that in commending, according to a common practice, the wealth and glory of the king, as the prophet here does, he did not mean to approve of the abuse of them. It was not his design to set forth the example of a man in opposition to the law of God. It is true, indeed, that the power, dignity, and glory, which Solomon enjoyed, were granted to him as singular blessings from God; but as generally happens, he defiled them greatly by not exercising self-control, and in abusing the great abundance with which he was blessed, by the excessive indulgence of the flesh. In short, it is here recorded what great liberality God manifested towards Solomon in giving him every thing in abundance. As to the fact that he took to him so many wives, and did not exercise a due moderation in his pomp, this is not to be included in the liberality of God, but is a thing as it were accidental. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(165)</span> Calvin here seems to take the word <span class="lang he-il">מני</span>, <em>Minni</em>, which has somewhat perplexed commentators, to be the particle <span class="lang he-il">מן</span>, <em>min</em>, <em>out of</em>, with <span class="lang he-il">י</span>, <em>yod</em>, paragogic, as it is in <span class="bvs">Psa_44:19</span>, and many other places; and to suppose that the relative <span class="lang he-il">אשר</span>,<em>asher</em>, <em>which</em>, a pronoun frequently omitted, is to be understood, — “<em>out of which </em>palaces <em>they have made thee glad</em>. ” This is the view taken by many interpreters. Others understand the word <span class="lang he-il">מני</span>, <em>minni</em>, to be a noun; (and from <span class="bvs">Jer_51:27</span>, it appears that <span class="lang he-il">מני</span>, <em>minni</em>, was the proper name of a territory, which Bochart shows was a district of Armenia;) and they translate the words thus, “From the ivory palaces of Armenia they make thee glad,” make thee glad with presents. Others suppose that <span class="lang he-il">מני</span>, <em>minni</em>, is here the name of a region, <em>Minnaea </em>in Arabia Felix, which abounded in myrrh and frankincense; and according to this view, the clause may be rendered, “The Minnaeitas from their ivory palaces make thee glad;” that is, coming to thee from their ivory palaces they gladden thee with presents. Rosenmüller thinks with Schmidt, De Wette, and Gesenius, that a more elegant sense will be brought out if we understand <span class="lang he-il">מני</span>, <em>minni</em>, as a plural noun in a form somewhat unusual, but of which there are several other examples in the Old Testament, such as <span class="lang he-il">שכשי</span>, <span class="bvs">2Sa_23:8</span>; <span class="lang he-il">כרי</span>, <span class="bvs">2Kg_9:4</span>; <span class="lang he-il">עמי</span>, <span class="bvs">2Sa_22:44</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_144:2</span>. “The word,” says he, “according to these examples, stands for <span class="lang he-il">מנים</span>, and signifies, as in the Syriac, <span class="bvs">Psa_150:4</span>, <em>chords</em>, <em>stringed </em>instruments of music. The sense of the clause will thus be, ‘From the palaces of ivory, musical instruments — players on musical instruments — make thee glad.’” — <em>Rosenmüller on the Messianic Psalms</em>, pp. 213-215. — <em>Biblical Cabinet</em>, volume 32. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(166)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme un peu apres le prophere descrit la Royne ornee somptueusement et magnifiquement</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(167)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ou, dames d’honneur</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(168)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car combien que la fille du Roy d’Egypte que Salomon avoit espousee, fust sa principale femme, et teinst le premier lieu</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
