<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Because there was no room for them in the inn </em>We see here not only the great poverty of Joseph, but the cruel tyranny which admitted of no excuse, but compelled Joseph to bring his wife along with him, at an inconvenient season, when she was near the time of her delivery. Indeed, it is probable that those who were the descendants of the royal family were treated more harshly and disdainfully than the rest. Joseph was not so devoid of feeling as to have no concern about his wife’s delivery. He would gladly have avoided this necessity: but, as that is impossible, he is forced to yield, <span class="cite-ref">(131)</span> and commends himself to God. We see, at the same time, what sort of beginning the life of the Son of God had, and in what cradle <span class="cite-ref">(132)</span> he was placed. Such was his condition at his birth, because he had taken upon him our flesh for this purpose, that he might, “empty himself” (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>) on our account. When he was thrown into a stable, and placed in a manger, and a lodging refused him among men, it was that heaven might be opened to us, not as a temporary lodging, <span class="cite-ref">(133)</span> but as our eternal country and inheritance, and that angels might receive us into their abode. </p><p><strong>(131)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il baisse la teste</span>;” — “he bows the head.” </p><p><strong>(132)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comment il a este heberge</span>.” </p><p><strong>(133)</strong> “Non modo hospitii jure;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">non point comme un logis pour y estre hebergez en passant</span>.” </p></div>
