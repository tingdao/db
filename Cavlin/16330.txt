<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Jehovah is good to all</em>, <em>etc</em>. The truth here stated is of wider application than the former, for the declaration of David is to the effect, that not only does God, with fatherly indulgence and clemency, forgive sin, but is good to all without discrimination, as he makes his sun to rise upon the good and upon the wicked. (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:45</span>.) Forgiveness of sin is a treasure from which the wicked are excluded, but their sin and depravity does not prevent God from showering down his goodness upon them, which they appropriate without being at all sensible of it. Meanwhile believers, and they only, know what it is to enjoy a reconciled God, as elsewhere it is said — </p><p>“Come ye to him, and be ye enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed; taste and see that the Lord is good.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_34:5</span>.) </p><p>When it is added that <em>the mercy of God extends to all his works</em>, this ought not to be considered as contrary to reason, or obscure. Our sins having involved the whole world in the curse of God, there is everywhere an opportunity for the exercise of God’s mercy, even in helping the brute creation. </p></div>
