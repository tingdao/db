<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>And I will set his hand in the sea. </em>The vast extent of the kingdom is here adverted to. As the people by their wickedness had, as it were, blocked up the way, and intercepted the blessing of God, their inheritance was more limited than the promise implied. But now God declares, that during the reign of David, it will be again enlarged, so that the people shall possess the whole country, from the sea even to the river Euphrates. From this we gather, that what God had promised by Moses was fulfilled only in the person of David, that is to say, from his time. <span class="cite-ref">(544)</span> By <em>the rivers </em>may be understood, either the Euphrates alone, which is cut into many channels, or the other neighboring rivers on the coast of Syria. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(544)</span> “Sicuti nugantur Sophistae.” —<em>Lat</em>. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme gazouillent ces brouillons et Sophistes de Sorbonistes</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
