<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt. </em>Under the figure of a vine, the singular grace which God was graciously pleased to exercise towards his people after he had redeemed them is celebrated; and this powerfully contributed to inspire them with the hope of being heard. For which of us can be so presumptuous as to dare to come into the presence of God until he himself has previously invited us? Now, he allures us to himself both by his benefits and by his word. The object in view in now presenting his liberality before him is, that he should not leave unfinished the work of his hands which he had commenced. It is indeed true that, without his word, the benefits which he has conferred upon us would make a faint impression upon our hearts; but when experience is added to the testimony of his word, it greatly encourages us. Now, the redemption of which mention is here made was inseparably connected with the covenant of God; for he had, even four hundred years before, entered into covenant with Abraham, in which he promised the deliverance of his seed. What is stated amounts in short to this, that it is unbecoming that God should now suffer the vine which he had planted and cultivated so carefully with his own hand to be wasted by wild beasts. God’s covenant was not made to last only for a few days, or for a short time: when he adopted the children of Abraham, he took them under his keeping for ever. By the word <em>vine, </em>is intimated the high place which this people held in the estimation of God, who not only was pleased to hold them as his own inheritance, but who also distinguished them by peculiar honor, even as a vine excels all other possessions. When it is said that the <em>land </em>or <em>ground was cleansed, </em>this is a repetition of what had been previously stated, that the <em>heathen were cast out </em>to make room for the chosen people. Perhaps, however, the allusion is to the continual digging which vines require, in order to their being kept clean lest they should degenerate; this allusion being made with the view of showing how God had performed the part of a good husbandman towards his people, since, after having planted them, he did not cease to employ every means to cherish and preserve them. What is added immediately after, <em>Thou hast rooted its roots, </em>is not to be understood of the planting of it at first, but of the pains taken by God to propagate it, <span class="cite-ref">(393)</span> which is a part of the culture of the vine. Whence it follows that <em>the mountains were covered with its shadow; </em>for the whole country, although mountainous, was filled with inhabitants; so much did that people increase in number. The branches of this vine are compared to <em>the cedars of God, </em>that is, to the most beautiful and most excellent cedars; thereby to express still more vividly how eminently the seed of Abraham were blessed of God. The sea and the Euphrates, as is well known, were the divinely appointed boundaries of the land promised them for an inheritance. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(393)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais du travail qu’il avoit prins a la provigner</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
