<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>But according to thy hardness, etc. </em>When we become hardened against the admonitions of the Lord, impenitence follows; and they who are not anxious about repentance openly provoke the Lord. <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span></p><p>This is a remarkable passage: we may hence learn what I have already referred to — that the ungodly not only accumulate for themselves daily a heavier weight of God’s judgments, as long as they live here, but that the gifts of God also, which they continually enjoy, shall increase their condemnation; for an account of them all will be required: and it will then be found, that it will be justly imputed to them as an extreme wickedness, that they had been made worse through God’s bounty, by which they ought surely to have been improved. Let us then take heed, lest by unlawful use of blessings we lay up for ourselves this cursed treasure. </p><p><em>For the day, etc.</em>; literally, <em>in the day; </em>but it is put for <span class="lang el-gr">εἰς ἡμέραν</span>, for the day. The ungodly gather now the indignation of God against themselves, the stream of which shall then be poured on their heads: they accumulate hidden destruction, which then shall be drawn out from the treasures of God. The day of the last judgment is called the day of wrath, when a reference is made to the ungodly; but it will be a day of redemption to the faithful. And thus all other visitations of God are ever described as dreadful and full of terror to the ungodly; and on the contrary, as pleasant and joyful to the godly. Hence whenever the Scripture mentions the approach of the Lord, it bids the godly to exult with joy; but when it turns to the reprobate, it proclaims nothing but dread and terror. </p><p>“A day of wrath,” saith Zephaniah, “shall be that day, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and wretchedness, a day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of mist and of whirlwind.” (<span class="bvs">Zep_1:15</span>.) </p><p>You have a similar description in <span class="bvs">Joe_2:2</span>, etc. And Amos exclaims, </p><p>“Woe To You Who Desire The Day Of The Lord! What Will It Be To You? The Day Of The Lord Will Be Darkness, And Not Light.” (<span class="bvs">Amo_5:18</span>.) </p><p>Farther, by adding the word <em>revelation, </em>Paul intimates what this day of wrath is to be, — that the Lord will then manifest his judgment: though he gives daily some indications of it, he yet suspends and holds back, till that day, the clear and full manifestation of it; for the books shall then be opened; the sheep shall then be separated the goats, and the wheat shall be cleansed from the tares. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(65)</span> What follows in the text, according to [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>], is this, “et Corinthians pœni tere nescium — and a heart that knoweth not to repent<span class="lang el-gr">;” καὶ ἀμετανοητον καρδίαν, </span> which [<span class="bvs">Schleusner </span>] renders thus, “animus, qui omnem emendationem respuit — a mind which rejects every improvement.” It is an impenitable rather than “an impenitent heart,” that is, a heart incapable of repenting. See <span class="bvs">Eph_4:19</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
