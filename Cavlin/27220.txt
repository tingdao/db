<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong>And therefore Luke saith that he <em>fell to the ground. </em>For what other thing can befall man, but that he must lie prostrate and be, as it were, brought to nothing, when he is overwhelmed with the present feeling of Godâ€™s glory? And this was the first beginning of the bringing down of Paul, that he might become apt to hear the voice of Christ, which he had despised so long as he sat haughtily upon his horse. </p><p><em>Saul, Saul! </em>Luke compared the light which shined round about Paul to lightning, though I do not doubt but that lightnings did fly in the air. And this voice, which Christ did send out to beat down his pride, may full well be called a <em>lightning </em>or<em>thunderbolt, </em>because it did not only strike him, and make him astonished, but did quite kill him, so that he was now as nobody with himself, who did so much please himself before and did challenge to himself authority to put the gospel to flight. Luke putteth down his name in Hebrew in this place, <em>Saul, Saul! </em>because he repeateth the words of Christ, who spake unto him, undoubtedly, according to the common custom of the country. </p></div>
