<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>When I shall pass through Macedonia </em>The common opinion is, that this espistle was sent from Philippi. Persons coming thence to Corinth by land, required to pass through Macedonia; for that colony is situated in the farthest extremity, towards the Emathian mountains. Paul, it is true, might, instead of going by land, have gone thither by sea, but he was desirous to visit the Macedonian Churches, that he might confirm them in passing. So much for the common opinion. To me, however, it appears more probable, that the epistle was written at Ephesus; for he says a little afterwards, that <em>he will remain there until Pentecost, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_16:8</span>) <span class="cite-ref">(156)</span>; and he salutes the Corinthians, not in the name of the Philippians, but of the <em>Asiatics. </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_16:19</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(157)</span> Besides, in the second epistle he explicitly states, that, after he had sent away this epistle, he passed over into Macedonia. (<span class="bvs">2Co_2:13</span>.) Now after passing through Macedonia, he would be at a distance from Ephesus, and in the neighborhood of Achaia. Hence I have no doubt that he was at Ephesus at that time: <em>thence </em>he could sail by a straight course to Achaia. For visiting Macedonia, a long circuit was needed, and a more disagreeable route. Accordingly he lets them know that he will not come to them by a direct course, as he required to <em>go through Macedonia </em></p><p>To the Corinthians, however, he promises something farther — that he would <em>make a longer stay with them </em>By this he shows his affection towards them. For what reason had he for delay, except that he was concerned as to their welfare? On the other hand, he lets them know how fully assured he is of their affection towards him in return, by taking it, as it were, for granted that he would be conducted forward by them in the way of kindness; for he says this from <em>confidence </em>in their friendship. <span class="cite-ref">(158)</span></p><p>After saying everything, however, he subjoins this limitation —<em>if the Lord permit </em>With this reservation, saints ought to follow up all their plans and deliberations; for it is an instance of great rashness to undertake and determine many things for the future, while we have not even a moment in our power. The main thing indeed is, that, in the inward affection of the mind, we submit to God and his providence, whatever we resolve upon; <span class="cite-ref">(159)</span> but at <em>the </em>same time, it is becoming that we should accustom ourselves to such forms of expression, that whenever we have to do with what is future we may make everything depend on the divine will. <span class="cite-ref">(160)</span></p><p><strong>(156)</strong> “St. Paul was now at <em>Ephesus; </em>for almost all allow, in opposition to the <em>subscription </em>at the end of this epistle, that states it to have been written from <em>Philippi, </em>that it was written from <em>Ephesus; </em>and this is supported by many strong arguments; and the 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse here seems to put it past all question: I <em>will tarry at Ephesus; </em>i.e., I am in Ephesus, and here I purpose to remain until Pentecost.” — Dr. <em>Adam Clarke.nEd. </em></p><p><strong>(157)</strong><em>“The Churches of Asia salute you, i.e., </em>the Churches in <em>Asia Minor. </em>Ephesus was in this Asia, and it is clear from this that the Apostle was not at <em>Philippi. </em>Had he been at Philippi, as the subscription states, he would have said, The Churches of Macedonia, not the Churches of Asia, <em>salute you.” </em>— <em>Dr. Adam Clarke. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(158)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils le conduiront par tout ou il ira</span>;” — “They will conduct him forward wherever he may go.” </p><p><strong>(159)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tout ce que nous entreprenons et consultons</span>;” — “Everything that we undertake and resolve upon.” </p><p><strong>(160)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De remettre a la volonte de Dieu tout ce que nous entreprendrons pour le temps aduenir</span>;” — “So as to give up to the will of God everything that we shall undertake for the time to come. </p></div>
