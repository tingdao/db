But it may be asked, was he not even then the Mediator in whose name men ought to pray to the Father? I reply, he plainly discharged the office of Mediator, ever since he entered into the heavenly sanctuary; as we shall afterwards repeat at the proper place. </p><p><em>That the Father may be glorified in the Son. </em>This passage agrees with what Paul says, </p><p>That every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father, (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:11</span>.) </p><p>The end of all things is the sanctification of the name of God; but here the true method of sanctifying it is declared; that is, <em>in the Son</em>, and <em>by the Son</em>. For, though the majesty of God be in itself hidden from us, it shines <em>in Christ</em>; though his hand be concealed, we have it visible <em>in Christ</em>. Consequently, in the benefits which the Father bestows upon us, we have no right to separate <em>the Father </em>from <em>the Son</em>, according to that saying, </p><p>He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_6:23</span>.) </p></div>
