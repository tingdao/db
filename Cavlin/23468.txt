<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Clothed with soft garments </em>Those who think that Christ here condemns the extravagance of a court are mistaken. There are many other passages in which luxury of dress, and excessive attention to outward appearance, are censured. But this passage simply means, that there was nothing in the wilderness to attract the people from every quarter; that every thing there was rude and unpolished, and fitted only to inspire disgust; and that such elegance of dress as delights the eyes is rather to be looked for in the courts of kings. <span class="cite-ref">(13)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(13)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que pour voir de beaux vestemens et autres choses agencees bien proprement il faut plustost aller es Cours des Rois</span>;” — “that in order to see fine dresses, and other things very neatly arranged, we must rather go to the courts of kings.” </p></div></div>
