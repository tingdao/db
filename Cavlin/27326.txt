<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Those which were scattered abroad. </em>Luke returneth now unto the former history, (and unto that which followed in the same.) For he had said before that after that Stephen was slain the cruelty of the wicked increased; and many fled hither and thither for fear, so that the apostles were almost left alone at Jerusalem. Whereas the Church was thus torn in pieces, and fear did cause those which were fled to keep silence or else contempt of strangers, <span class="cite-ref">(734)</span> he declareth that that event did follow which no man would have hoped for; for as the seed is sown that it may bring forth fruit, so it came to pass through their flight and scattering abroad, that the gospel was spread abroad in nations which were far off, which was included before within the walls of one city, as in a barn. <span class="cite-ref">(735)</span> In like sort it came to pass, that the name of Christ, passing over mountains and seas, did flow even unto the farthest parts of the world; and by this means, according to the prophecy of Isaiah, the consumption did abound <span class="cite-ref">(736)</span> in righteousness. If so many godly men had not been expelled out of Jerusalem, Cyprus had heard nothing, Phenice had heard nothing of Christ; yea, Italy and Spain, which were farther off, had heard nothing. But the Lord brought to pass, that of many torn members did arise more bodies. For how came it to pass that there were Churches gathered at Rome and at Puteoli, save only because a few exiled men, and such as fled away, <span class="cite-ref">(737)</span> had brought the gospel thither with them? And as God did at that time make the endeavors of Satan frustrate after a wonderful sort, so we need not doubt but that even at this day he will make to himself triumphs of the cross and persecution, that the Church may better grow together, though it be scattered abroad. Phenice joineth to Syria, and is nigh to Galilee. Antioch is a most famous city of Syria, at which part it is joined to Cilicia. </p><p><em>Speaking to none. </em>Peradventure they were letted not only with fear of persecution, that they durst not speak to the Gentiles, but also with that foolish religion, in that they thought that the children’s bread was thrown to the dogs, (<span class="bvs">Mar_16:15</span>;) whereas, notwithstanding, Christ had commanded that the gospel should be preached to all the world after his resurrection. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(734)</span> Transpose thus: “And fear, or else contempt of strangers, did cause those who had fled to keep silence.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(735)</span> Transpose thus: “The gospel which was before included, etc., was spread abroad,” etc. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(736)</span> “Consumptio exundavit,” the devastation overflowed. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(737)</span> “Pauci exules ac profugi,” a few exiles and fugitives. </p></div></div>
