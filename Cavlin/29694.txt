<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>Now the Lord of peace</em>. This prayer seems to be connected with the preceding sentence, with the view of recommending endeavors after concord and mildness. He had forbidden them to treat even the contumacious <span class="cite-ref">(731)</span> as <em>enemies</em>, but rather with a view to their being brought back to a sound mind <span class="cite-ref">(732)</span> by brotherly admonitions. He could appropriately, after this, subjoin an injunction as to the cultivation of peace; but as this is a work that is truly Divine, he betakes himself to prayer, which, nevertheless, has also the force of a precept. At the same time, he may also have another thing in view — that God may restrain unruly persons, <span class="cite-ref">(733)</span> that they may not disturb the peace of the Church. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(731)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mesme les rebelles et obstinez</span>;” — “Even the rebellious and obstinate.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(732)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A repentance et amendment</span>;” — “To repentance and amendment.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(733)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceux qui sont desobeissans</span>;” — “Those that are disobedient.” </p></div></div>
