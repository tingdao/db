<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>63.</strong><em>I adjure thee by the living God. The high priest </em>thought that this alone was a crime sufficient to condemn Christ, if he professed that he was <em>the Christ. </em>But since they all boasted of expecting redemption from Christ, he ought first to have inquired if such was the fact. That there would be a <em>Christ, </em>by whose hands the people were to be delivered, they would not have ventured to deny. Jesus came publicly forward, bearing the title of <em>the Christ. </em>Why do they not consider the fact itself? Why do they not examine the signs, by means of which a correct decision might have been formed? But, having already determined to put Christ to death, they are satisfied with this pretense of sacrilege, that he claimed for himself the glory of Divinity. And yet Caiaphas examines the matter on oath, as if he had been prepared to yield as soon as it was fully ascertained; but all the while his whole mind is filled with a malicious hatred and contempt of Christ, and is so blinded by pride and ambition, that he takes for granted, that as soon as the fact has been ascertained, without inquiring whether it is right or wrong, he will have just grounds for condemning him. </p><p><em>If thou art the Christ, the Son of God. </em>From the words of Caiaphas we may infer, that it was at that time common among the Jews to bestow on the Messiah the title of <em>the Son of God; </em>for this form of interrogation could not have originated in any other way than from the ordinary custom; and, indeed, they had learned from the predictions of Scripture that he was not less <em>the Son of God </em>than <em>the Son of David. </em>It appears, too, that Caiaphas employed this epithet, with the view either of terrifying Christ, or of exciting a prejudice against him; as if he had said, “See where you are going; for you cannot call yourself <em>the Christ, </em>without claiming, at the same time, the appellation of <em>Son of God, </em>with which Scripture honors him.” Such is also his reason for using the word <em>Blessed, </em>which Mark gives instead of <em>God; </em>for this pretended reverence <span class="cite-ref">(232)</span> for God was intended to bring a heavier charge against Christ than that of profaning the holy name of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(232)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce mot duquel Caiaphe use, faisant semblant d’avoir une grande reverence à la majesté Divine</span>;” — “this word which Caiaphas employs, pretending to have a great veneration for the Divine majesty.” </p></div></div>
