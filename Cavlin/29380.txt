<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19</strong><em>For I know that </em>As some published the gospel with the view of rendering Paul odious, in order that they might kindle up against him the more the rage of his enemies, he tells them beforehand that their wicked attempts will do him no harm, because the Lord will turn them to a contrary design. “Though they plot my destruction, yet I trust that all their attempts will have no other effect but that Christ will be glorified in me — which is a thing most salutary to me.” For it is evident from what follows, that he is not speaking of the safety of the body. But whence this confidence on the part of Paul? It is from what he teaches elsewhere, (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:28</span>,) — that all things contribute to the advantage of God’s true worshippers, even though the whole world, with the devil, its prince, should conspire together for their ruin. </p><p><em>Through your prayer </em>That he may stir them up to pray more ardently, he declares that he is confident that the Lord will give them an answer to their prayers. Nor does he use dissimulation: for he who depends for help on the prayers of the saints relies on the promise of God. In the mean time, nothing is detracted from the unmerited goodness of God, on which depend our prayers, and what is obtained by means of them. </p><p><em>And the supply</em>. Let us not suppose, that because he joins these two things in one connection, they are consequently alike. The statement must, therefore, be explained in this manner: — “I know that all this will turn out to my advantage, through the administration of the Spirit, you also helping by prayer,” — so that the supply of the Spirit is the efficient cause, while prayer is a subordinate help. We must also observe the propriety of the Greek term, for <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπιχορηγία</span> is employed to mean the furnishing of what is wanting, <span class="cite-ref">(79)</span> just as the Spirit of God pours into us everything of which we are destitute. </p><p>He calls him, too, the <em>Spirit of Jesus Christ</em>, to intimate, that if we are Christians, he is common to all of us, inasmuch as he was poured upon him with all fullness, that, according to the measure of his grace, he might give out, so far as is expedient, to each of his members. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(79)</span> “The word <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπιχορηγία</span> which we translate <em>supply</em>, signifies also <em>furnishing whatever is necessary.” </em>— <em>Dr. A.
