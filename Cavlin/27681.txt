<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>They received us gladly. </em>Luke reciteth this, therefore, that he may set forth the equity of the brethren, who did not credit rumors<span class="cite-ref">(467)</span> and false reports. Though many envious and wicked men did daily, one after another, endeavor to bring Paul in contempt, yet, because James and his fellows in office were well persuaded of his uprightness, they were not estranged from him. Therefore, they receive him now courteously and brotherly as a servant of Christ, and declare that he is welcome. This moderation must we observe diligently, that we be not too hasty to believe wicked reports, especially when those who have given some testimony of their honesty, and whom we have tried<span class="cite-ref">(468)</span> to serve God faithfully, are burdened with crimes unknown to us, or else doubtful, because Satan knoweth that nothing is more fit to lay waste the kingdom of Christ, than discord and disagreement among the faithful, he ceaseth not to spread abroad false<span class="cite-ref">(469)</span> speeches, which may cause one to suspect another. Therefore, we must shut our ears against false reports, that we may believe nothing concerning the faithful ministers of the Word, but that which we know to be true.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(467)</span></p><p>“ Sinistris ramoribus,” sinister rumours. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(468)</span></p><p>“ Experti sumus,” experienced. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(469)</span></p><p>“ Obliquos sermones,” indirect speeches, insinuations. counsel. </p></div></div>
