<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And thy brother perish </em>Mark how serious an evil it is, that mankind commonly think so little of — that of venturing upon anything with a doubtful or opposing conscience. For the object to which our whole life ought to be directed, is the will of the Lord. This, therefore, is the one thing that vitiates all our actions, when we disregard it. <span class="cite-ref">(474)</span> This we do, not merely by an outward action, but even by a thought of the mind, when we allow ourselves in anything in opposition to conscience, even though the thing be not evil in itself. Let us bear in mind, therefore, that whenever we take a step in opposition to conscience, we are on the high road to ruin. </p><p>I read, however, the sentence interrogatively, thus: <em>Shall he perish through thy knowledge </em>? as though he had said: “Is it reasonable that thy knowledge should give occasion of ruin to thy brother? Is it for this reason that thou knowest what is right, that thou mayest cause another’s ruin!” He makes use of the term <em>brother</em>, in order to expose their pride as unfeeling, in this way: “It is true that the person whom you despise is <em>weak</em>, but still he is your <em>brother</em>, for God has adopted him. You act a cruel part, therefore, in having no concern for your brother.” There is, however, still greater force in what follows — that even those that are ignorant or weak have been <em>redeemed with the blood of Christ</em>; for nothing were more unseemly than this, that while Christ did not hesitate to die, in order that the weak might not perish, we, on the other hand, reckon as nothing the salvation of those who have been redeemed with so great a price. A memorable saying, by which we are taught how precious the salvation of our brethren ought to be in our esteem, and not merely that of all, but of each individual in particular, inasmuch as the blood of Christ was poured out for each individual! </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(474)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand nous entreprenons quelque chose center ceste saincte volonte</span>;” — “When we attempt anything in opposition to that holy will.” </p></div></div>
