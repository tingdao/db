<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Let those who rejoice at thy hurt be ashamed and confounded together. </em>This imprecation has already been expounded; and it is only necessary to remark, that there is peculiar force in the expression, <em>together, </em>or <em>at once. </em>It shows that it was not only one or two, but a great multitude, who waged war against him, and that he yielded not to the influence of fear, but believed that as soon as God should lift up his hand, he could at one stroke easily overthrow them all. When it is said that they seek after and <em>rejoice in Davidâ€™s hurt, </em>this shows that they were filled with cruel hatred against him. And when it is said, that they <em>magnify themselves against him, </em>this is a token of pride. David, therefore, in order to render them more hateful in the sight of God, represents them as filled with pride and cruelty. And as this form of prayer was dictated by the Holy Spirit to David, there can be no doubt that the end of all the proud shall be such as is here predicted, that they shall turn back overwhelmed with shame and disgrace. </p></div>
