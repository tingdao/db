<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Come and see the works of God </em>An indirect censure is here passed upon that almost universal thoughtlessness which leads men to neglect the praises of God. Why is it that they so blindly overlook the operations of his hand, but just because they never direct their attention seriously to them? We need to be aroused upon this subject. The words before us may receive some explanation by referring to a parallel passage, <span class="bvs">Psa_46:8</span>. But the great scope of them is this, that the Psalmist would withdraw men from the vain or positively sinful and pernicious pursuits in which they are engaged, and direct their thoughts to the works of God. To this he exhorts them, chiding their backwardness and negligence. The expression, <em>Come and see, </em>intimates that what they blindly overlooked was open to observation; for were it otherwise with the works of God, this language would be inappropriate. He next points out what those works of God are to which he would have our attention directed; in general he would have us look to the method in which God governs the human family. This experimental or practical kind of knowledge, if I might so call it, is that which makes the deepest impression. <span class="cite-ref">(473)</span> We find, accordingly, that Paul, (<span class="bvs">Act_17:27</span>) after speaking of the power of God in general, brings his subject to bear upon this one particular point, and calls upon us to descend into ourselves if we would discover the proofs of a present God. The last clause of the fifth verse I would not interpret with some as meaning that God was <em>terrible above the children of men </em>— superior to them in majesty — but rather that <em>he is terrible towards them, </em>evincing an extraordinary providence in their defense and preservation, as we have seen noticed, <span class="bvs">Psa_40:5</span>. Men need look no further, therefore, than themselves, in order to discover the best grounds for reverencing and fearing God. The Psalmist passes next from the more general point of his providence towards mankind at large, to his special care over his own Church, adverting to what he had done for the redemption of his chosen people. What he states here must be considered as only one illustration of many which he might have touched upon, and as intended to remind God’s people of the infinite variety of benefits with which their first and great deliverance had been followed up and confirmed. This appears obvious from what he adds, <em>there we rejoiced in him </em>It is impossible that the joy of that deliverance could have extended to him or any of the descendants of the ancient Israelites, unless it had partaken the nature of a pledge and illustration of the love of God to the Church generally. Upon that event he showed himself to be the everlasting Savior of his people; so that it proved a common source of joy to all the righteous. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(473)</span> “Haec enim experimentalis (ut ita loquar) notitia magis afficit.” — <em>Lat</em>. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car ceste cognoissance d’experience et de prattique esmeut d’avantage</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
