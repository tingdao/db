<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>50.</strong><em>Now this I say </em>This clause intimates, that what follows is explanatory of the foregoing statement. “What I have said as to <em>bearing the image of the heavenly Adam </em>means this — that we must be renewed in respect of our bodies, inasmuch as our bodies, being liable to corruption, cannot inherit God’s incorruptible kingdom. Hence there will be no admission for us into the kingdom of Christ, otherwise than by Christ’s renewing us after his own image.” <em>Flesh and blood, </em>however, we must understand, <em>according to the condition in which they at present are, </em>for our flesh will be a participant in the glory of God, but it will be — as renewed and quickened by the Spirit of Christ. </p></div>
