<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>An adversary, and that exalteth himself</em>. The two epithets — <em>man of sin</em>, and <em>son of perdition </em>— intimate, in the first place, how dreadful the confusion would be, that the unseemliness of it might not discourage weak minds; and farther, they tend to stir up the pious to a feeling of detestation, lest they should degenerate along with others. Paul, however, now draws, as if in a picture, a striking likeness of Antichrist; for it may be easily gathered from these words what is the nature of his kingdom, and in what things it consists. For, when he calls him an <em>adversary</em>, when he says that he will claim for himself those things which belong to God, so that he is worshipped in the temple as God, he places his kingdom in direct opposition to the kingdom of Christ. Hence, as the kingdom of Christ is spiritual, so this tyranny must be upon souls, that it may rival the kingdom of Christ. We shall also find him afterwards assigning to him the power of deceiving, by means of wicked doctrines and pretended miracles. If, accordingly, you would know Antichrist, you must view him as diametrically opposed to Christ.<span class="cite-ref">(642)</span></p><p>Where I have rendered — <em>everything that is called God</em>, the reading more generally received among the Greeks is, <em>every one that is called</em>. It may, however, be conjectured, both from the old translation <span class="cite-ref">(643)</span> and from some Greek commentaries, that Paul’s words have been corrupted. The mistake, too, of a single letter was readily fallen into, especially when the shape of the letter was much similar; for, where there was written <span class="lang el-gr">πᾶν τὸ</span>, (<em>everything</em>,) some transcriber, or too daring reader, turned it into <span class="lang el-gr">πάντα</span>, (<em>every one</em>.) This difference, however, is not of so much importance as to the sense, for Paul undoubtedly means that Antichrist would take to himself those things that belonged to God alone, so that he would <em>exalt himself </em>above every divine claim, that all religion and all worship of God might lie under his feet. This expression then, <em>everything that is reckoned to be God</em>, is equivalent to <em>everything that is reckoned as Divinity</em>, and <span class="lang el-gr">σέβασμα</span>, that is, in which the veneration due to God consists. </p><p>Here, however, the subject treated of is not the name of God himself, but his majesty and worship, and, in general, everything that he claims for himself. “True religion is that by which the true God alone is worshipped; <em>that</em>, the <em>son of perdition </em>will transfer to himself.” Now, every one that has learned from Scripture what are the things that more especially belong to God, and will, on the other hand, observe what the Pope claims for himself — though he were but a boy of ten years of age — will have no great difficulty in recognizing Antichrist. Scripture declares that God is the <em>alone Lawgiver </em>(<span class="bvs">Jas_4:12</span>) <em>who is able to save and to destroy; </em>the alone King, whose office it is to govern souls by his word. It represents him as the author of all sacred rites; <span class="cite-ref">(644)</span> it teaches that righteousness and salvation are to be sought from Christ alone; and it assigns, at the same time, the manner and means. There is not one of these things that the Pope does not affirm to be under his authority. He boasts that it is his to bind consciences with such laws as seem good to him, and subject them to everlasting punishment. As to sacraments, he either institutes new ones, according to his own inclination, <span class="cite-ref">(645)</span> or he corrupts and deforms those which had been instituted by Christ — nay, sets them aside altogether, that he may substitute in their place the sacrileges <span class="cite-ref">(646)</span> which he has invented. He contrives means of attaining salvation that are altogether at variance with the doctrine of the Gospel; and, in fine, he does not hesitate to change the whole of religion at his own pleasure. What is it, I pray you, for one to lift up himself above everything that is reckoned God, if the Pope does not do so? When he thus robs God of his honor, he leaves him nothing remaining but an empty title of Deity, <span class="cite-ref">(647)</span> while he transfers to himself the whole of his power. And this is what Paul adds shortly afterwards, that <em>the son of perdition would shew himself as God</em>. For, as has been said, he does not insist upon the simple term <em>God</em>, but intimates, that the pride <span class="cite-ref">(648)</span> of Antichrist would be such, that, raising himself above the number and rank of servants, and mounting the judgment-seat of God, <span class="cite-ref">(649)</span> would reign, not with a human, but with a divine authority. For we know that whatever is raised up into the place of God is an idol, though it should not bear the name of God. </p><p><em>In the temple of God</em>. By this one term there is a sufficient refutation of the error, nay more, the stupidity of those who reckon the Pope to be Vicar of Christ, on the ground that he has his seat in the Church, in whatever manner he may conduct himself; for Paul places Antichrist nowhere else than in the very sanctuary of God. For this is not a foreign, but a domestic enemy, who opposes Christ under the very name of Christ. But it is asked, how the Church is represented as the den of so many superstitions, while it was destined to be the <em>pillar of the truth? </em>(<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:15</span>.) I answer, that it is thus represented, not on the ground of its retaining all the qualities of the Church, but because it has something of it remaining. I accordingly acknowledge, that that is the <em>temple of God </em>in which the Pope bears rule, but at the same time profaned by innumerable sacrileges. </p><p><strong>(642)</strong> “The name of the Man of Sin is not <em>Antitheos</em>, but <span class="lang el-gr">ἀντίχριστος</span> — not one that directly invadeth the properties of the supreme God, but of God incarnate, or Christ as Mediator.
