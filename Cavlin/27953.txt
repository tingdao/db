<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And changed</em>, <em>etc. </em>Having feigned such a God as they could comprehend according to their carnal reason, they were very far from acknowledging the true God: but devised a fictitious and a new god, or rather a phantom. And what he says is, that they <em>changed </em>the glory of God; for as though one substituted a strange child, so they departed from the true God. Nor are they to be excused for this pretense, that they believe that God dwells in heaven, and that they count not the wood to be God, but his image; for it is a high indignity to God, to form so gross an idea of his majesty as to dare to make an image of him. But from the wickedness of such a presumption none were exempt, neither priests, nor statesmen, nor philosophers, of whom the most sound-minded, even Plato himself, sought to find out some likeness of God. </p><p>The madness then here noticed, is, that all attempted to make for themselves an image of God; which was a certain proof that their notions of God were gross and absurd. And, first, they befouled the majesty of God by forming him in the likeness of <em>a corruptible man</em>: for I prefer this rendering to that of <em>mortal man</em>, which is adopted by [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>] <em>; </em>for Paul sets not the immortality of God in opposition to the mortality of man, but that glory, which is subject to no defects, to the most wretched condition of man. And then, being not satisfied with so great a crime, they descended even to beasts and to those of the most filthy kind; by which their stupidity appeared still more evident. You may see an account of these abominations in <em>Lactantius</em>, in [<span class="bvs">Eusebius </span>] <em>, </em>and in [<span class="bvs">Augustine </span>] in his book <em>on the city of God. </em></p></div>
