<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Bear ye one another’s burdens</em>. The weaknesses or sins, under which we groan, are called <em>burdens</em>. This phrase is singularly appropriate in an exhortation to kind behavior, for nature dictates to us that those who bend under a burden ought to be relieved. He enjoins us to <em>bear </em>the burdens. We must not indulge or overlook the sins by which our brethren are pressed down, but relieve them, — which can only be done by mild and friendly correction. There are many adulterers and thieves, many wicked and abandoned characters of every description, who would willingly make Christ an accomplice in their crimes. All would choose to lay upon believers the task of bearing their burdens. But as the apostle had immediately before exhorted us to <em>restore </em>a brother, the manner in which Christians are required to <em>bear one another’s burdens </em>cannot be mistaken. </p><p><em>And so fulfill the law of Christ</em>. The word <em>law</em>, when applied here to Christ, serves the place of an argument. There is an implied contrast between the law of Christ and the law of Moses. “If you are very desirous to keep a law, Christ enjoins on you a law which you are bound to prefer to all others, and that is, to cherish kindness towards each other. He who has not this has nothing. On the other hand, he tells us, that, when every one compassionately assists his neighbor, the law of Christ is <em>fulfilled</em>; by which he intimates that every thing which does not proceed from love is superfluous; for the composition of the Greek word<span class="lang el-gr">ἀναπληρώσατε, </span> conveys the idea of what is absolutely perfect. But as no man performs in every respect what Paul requires, we are still at a distance from perfection. He who comes the nearest to it with regard to others, is yet far distant with respect to God. </p></div>
