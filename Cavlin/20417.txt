The verb <span class="lang he-il">הגה</span>, <em>ege </em>means to meditate, when no voice is uttered; but as the noun is connected here with lips, there is no doubt but that the Prophet refers to words, rather than to hidden meditations. <span class="cite-ref">(204)</span> He then says, that such were the conspiracies, that they did not conceal what they had in their hearts, but publicly avowed their wicked purposes. Now this insolence must have moved God to aid his people, so unjustly oppressed. </p><p>He adds, <em>every day, </em>or daily. This circumstance also must have availed to obtain favor, so that God might the sooner aid his people. For had the ungodly made violent assaults, and soon given over, it would have been easy to persevere in so short a trial, as when a storm soon passes by; but when they went on perseveringly in their machinations, it was very hard to bear the trial. And hence we derive a ground of hope, supplied to us by what the Holy Spirit suggests to us here, that God will be merciful to us on seeing the pertinacity of our enemies. He then adds, — </p><p><strong>(204)</strong> The best word is muttering, — </p><p>The lips of my adversaries, <LineBreak />And their muttering concerning me all the day. </p><p>It isn’t here, as in the previous verse, “concerning me,” not “against me.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
