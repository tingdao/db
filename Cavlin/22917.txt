<div class="comment-content"><p>We now see that he who is often said to be Jehovah is called an angel: the name therefore of Angel as well as of Jehovah, I doubt not, ought to be applied to the person of Christ, who is truly and really God, and at the same time a Mediator between the Father and the faithful: and hence he authoritatively commanded the angels who were present; for Christ was there, but with his hosts. While therefore the angels were standing by, ready to obey, he is said to have bidden them to strip the high priest of his mean garments. </p><p>Afterwards the angel addresses Joshua himself, <em>See, I slave made to pass from thee thine iniquity, and now I will clothe thee with new or other garments </em><span class="cite-ref">(38)</span> When the angel said that he had <em>taken away iniquity</em>, he justly reminded them of the filthiness contracted by the priest as well as by the people; for they had denuded themselves of all glory by their iniquities. We hence see that the mouths of the Jews were here closed, that they might not clamor against God, because he suffered them still to continue in their sordid condition, for they deserved to continue in such a state; and the Lord for this reason called their filth, iniquity. He further teaches us, that though the Jews fully deserved by their sins to rot in their struggle and filthiness, yet the Lord would not finally allow their unworthiness to prevent him from affording relief. </p><p>The import of the prophecy then is this, — That however much the mean outward condition of the high priest might offend the Jews, they were still to entertain hope; for the remedy was in God’s power, who would at length change the dishonor and reproach of the high priest into very great glory, even when the time of gratuitous remission or of good pleasure arrived. </p><p><strong>(38)</strong> [<span class="lang he-il">מחלצות</span> ], from [<span class="lang he-il">חלף</span> ], to set loose, or to put off. Both <em>Parkhurst </em>and <em>Blayney </em>think that they were the garments which the high priest wore on particular and solemn occasions, and which he <em>put off </em>when he had performed his office. “Holy garments” would perhaps be the best rendering. <em>Newcome </em>has “goodly apparel;” and <em>Henderson</em>, “costly habiliments;” garments of the high priest. And that they were the holy garments, such as the high priest wore on especial occasions, appears probable from what follows respectng the mitre, which formed a part of the high priest’s dress. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
