<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine. </em>He again repeats, the third time, that the same God who had been the deliverer of the chosen people exercises supreme dominion over the whole world. From the fact that God created all things, he concludes, that it is He who actually presides over, and controls whatever takes place in heaven and in earth. It would be absurd to suppose, that the heavens, having been once created by God, should now revolve by chance, and that things should be thrown into confusion upon the earth either at the will of men, or at random, when it is considered that it belongs to God to maintain and govern whatever he has created; unless, like the heathen, we would imagine that he enjoys himself in beholding all the works of his hand, in this beautiful theater of the heaven and the earth, without giving himself any farther trouble about them. In speaking of <em>the south </em>and <em>the north, </em>and also of the mountains, <em>Tabor </em>and <em>Hermon, </em>the prophet accommodates his language to the unrefined apprehension of the common people: as if he had said, there is no part of the fabric of the world which does not reverence and honor its Creator. I also connect with this the next verse, which affirms, that <em>the arm of God is furnished with power, his hand with strength, and that his right hand is exalted </em>Some resolve the two last clauses of the verse into the form of a prayer, <em>Strengthen thy hand, lift up thy right hand; </em>but this seems too much removed from the mind of the prophet, who, with the simple view of encouraging all the godly, celebrates the inconceivable power of God. </p></div>
