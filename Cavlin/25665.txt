<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Jesus, Master </em><span class="cite-ref">(338)</span> It is evident that all of them possessed some measure of faith, not only because they implore Christ’s assistance, but because they honor him with the title of <em>Master </em>That they made use of that expression sincerely, and not in hypocrisy, may be inferred from their ready obedience; for, although they perceive that the filthy scab still remains in their flesh, yet as soon as they are commanded to <em>show themselves to the priests, </em>they do not refuse to obey. Add to this that, but for the influence of faith, they would never have set out to <em>show themselves to the priests; </em>for it would have been absurd to present themselves to the judges of leprosy, for the purpose of attesting that they had been cleansed, if the promise of Christ had been regarded by them as of no more value than a mere inspection of the disease. They bear a visible leprosy in their flesh; and yet, trusting to Christ’s word alone, they have no scruple about declaring that they are clean. It cannot therefore be denied, that some seed of faith had been implanted in their hearts. Now though it is certain that they were not regenerated by the Spirit of adoption, yet there is no absurdity in supposing that they had some beginnings of piety. There is the greater reason to fear that sparks of faith, which make their appearance in us, may be extinguished; for, although lively faith, which has its roots deeply fixed by the Spirit of regeneration, never dies, yet we have seen formerly that many conceive a temporary faith, which immediately disappears. Above all, it is too common a disease that, when we are urged by strong necessity, and when the Lord himself prompts us by a secret movement of the Spirit, we seek God, but, when we have obtained our wishes, ungrateful forgetfulness swallows up that feeling of piety. Thus poverty and hunger beget faith, but abundance kills it. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(338)</span><em>“ </em><em class="lang fr-fr">Iesus, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">nostre </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Maistre </em>;” — “<em>Jesus, </em>our <em>Master.” </em></p></div></div>
