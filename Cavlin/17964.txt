It was no doubt faulty in them that they indulged in so many ceremonies and gesticulations; but the Prophet spoke of them as what was known and common, only for the purpose of describing the grief which would follow the desolation of that country. </p><p><em>Every one shall howl and descend to weeping. </em><span class="cite-ref">(240)</span> It was with good reason that he added this description; for we are never moved by predictions, unless the Lord place them, as it were, before our eyes. Lest the Jews should think that these matters might be lightly passed by, when he described that destruction, he determined to mention also <em>mourning, weeping, and howling</em>, that they might see almost with their own eyes those events which appear to be incredible, for the Moabites were at that time in a state of profound peace, and believers had the more need of being confirmed, that they might not call this prophecy in question. By the same means he points out the despair to which unbelievers are liable in adversity, for the support on which they rely is insecure. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(239)</span> Bogus footnote </p><p><span class="cite-note">(240)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
