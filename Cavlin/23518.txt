<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God. </em>Luke says,<em>if I cast out devils by The Finger of God; </em>employing the word <em>Finger </em>metaphorically instead of the <em>Spirit. </em>As God works, and exerts his power, by his Spirit, it is with propriety that the word <em>Finger </em>is applied to him. And this mode of expression was common among the Jews, as Moses relates that Pharaohâ€™s magicians said, <em>This is the finger of God </em>Now Christ infers from what he has already stated, that the scribes prove themselves to be ungrateful to God, by being unwilling that He should reign among them. Hitherto, he replied to their idle calumny; but now, he treats them as convicted persons, and charges them not to make ungodly opposition to the kingdom of God. He does not confine himself to a single miracle, but takes occasion from it to discourse on the object of his coming, reminds them that they ought not merely to look at one remarkable fact, but at a far more important truth, that it was the will of God, by revealing His Messiah, to raise up their salvation which was fallen, and to restore his kingdom among them. Thus we see that Christ complains of their ingratitude, in madly rejecting from the midst of them the inestimable grace of God. <em>The kingdom of God hath come to you </em>The word <em>come </em>is emphatic, and implies that, without any request from them, God appears as their Redeemer, while they do everything that is in their power to drive him away, and, when he is present and prepared for their salvation, refuse to give him a place. </p></div>
