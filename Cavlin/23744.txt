<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>But if he shall not hear thee. </em>The second step is, that he who displayed obstinacy, or refused to yield to one man, should be again admonished in presence of <em>witnesses </em>Here some object, that it will serve no purpose to call <em>witnesses</em>, if we have to deal with an obstinate and rebellious man, because their presence will be so far from leading him to acknowledge his guilt, that he will only make a more wicked denial. But this difficulty will be speedily removed, if we distinguish between <em>denial </em>and <em>evasion </em>He who explicitly denies the fact, and declares that he is falsely and calumniously accused, must be left alone; for it would be ill vain to press him by calling <em>witnesses </em>But as, in most cases, men shamelessly evade, or impudently excuse, the improper and unjust actions which they have committed, till greater authority is employed, towards such persons it is useful to observe this method. </p><p>That Christ’s discourse ought to be understood in this sense is evident from the word used, <span class="lang el-gr">ἔλεγξον</span>, <em>reprove</em>, or <em>argue; </em>for to argue is to convince by demonstration. <span class="cite-ref">(555)</span> And how could I <em>argue </em>with a man <span class="cite-ref">(556)</span> who boldly denies the whole matter? for he who has the effrontery to deny the crime which he has committed shuts the door against a second admonition. </p><p>We now perceive for what purpose Christ proposes to call <em>witnesses</em>. It is, to give greater weight and impressiveness to the admonition. As to the slightly different meaning to which he has turned the words of Moses, it involves no absurdity. Moses forbids sentence to be pronounced on a matter that is unknown, and defines this to be the lawful mode of proving, that it be <em>established </em>by the testimony of </p><p>two or three witnesses. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Deu_19:15</span>.) </p><p>Alluding to that law, Christ says that, when two or three witnesses shall rise up to condemn the obstinacy of the man, the case will be clear, at least till the Church be prepared to take cognizance of it; for he who refuses to hear <em>two or three witnesses </em><span class="cite-ref">(557)</span> will have no reason to complain that he is dragged forth to light. </p><p><em>Tell it to the Church. </em>It is asked, what does he mean by the term <em>Church? </em>For Paul orders (<span class="bvs">1Co_5:5</span>) that the incestuous Corinthian shall be excommunicated, not by a certain chosen number, but by the whole assembly of the godly; and therefore it might appear to be probable that the power of judging is bestowed on the whole of the people. But as at that time no <em>Church </em>as yet was in existence, which acknowledged the authority of Christ, and no such order had been established, and as our Lord employs the ordinary and received forms of expression, there can be no doubt that he alludes to the order of the ancient <em>Church</em>, as in other places also he accommodates his modes of expression to what was known and customary. <span class="cite-ref">(558)</span> When he commands that: </p><p>the offering, which we intend to present, shall be left at the altar, till we are reconciled to an offended brother, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_5:23</span>,) </p><p>he unquestionably intends, by means of that form of the worship of God which was then in existence and in force, to teach us, that we cannot in a right manner either pray, or offer any thing to God, so long as we are at variance with our brethren. So then he now looked at the form of discipline which was observed among the Jews; for it would have been absurd to propose an appeal to the judgment of a <em>Church </em>which was not yet in existence. </p><p>Now since among the Jews the power of excommunication belonged to the elders, who held the government of the whole <em>Church</em>, Christ speaks appropriately when he says that they who sinned must at length be brought forward publicly to <em>the Church</em>, if they either despise haughtily, or ridicule and evade, the private admonitions. We know that, after the Jews returned from the Babylonish captivity, a council was formed, which they called <em>Sanhedrim</em>, and in Greek <em>Synedrion</em>, ( <span class="lang el-gr">συνέδριον</span>) and that to this council was committed the superintendence of morals and of doctrine. This government was lawful and approved by God, and was a bridle to restrain within their duty the dissolute and incorrigible. </p><p>It will perhaps be objected that, in the time of Christ, every thing was corrupt and perverted, so that this tyranny was very far from deserving to be accounted the judgment of <em>the Church </em>But the reply is easy. Though the method of procedure was at that time depraved and perverted, yet Christ justly praises that order, such as it had been handed down to them from the fathers. And when, shortly afterwards, he erected a <em>Church</em>, while he removed the abuse, he restored the proper use of excommunication. Yet there is no reason to doubt that the form of discipline, which prevailed in the kingdom of Christ, succeeded in the room of that ancient discipline. And certainly, since even heathen nations maintained a shadowy form of excommunication, it appears that, from the beginning, this was impressed by God on the minds of men, that those who were impure and polluted ought to be excluded from religious services. <span class="cite-ref">(559)</span> It would therefore have been highly disgraceful to the people of God to have been altogether destitute of that discipline, some trace of which remained among the Gentiles. But what had been preserved under the Law Christ has conveyed to us, because we hold the same rank with the ancient fathers. For it was not the intention of Christ to send his disciples to the synagogue, which, while it willingly cherished in its bosom disgraceful filth, excommunicated the true and sincere worshippers of God; but he reminded us that the order, which had been formerly established in a holy manner under the Law, must be maintained in his <em>Church </em></p><p><em>Let him be to thee as a heathen and a publican. </em>What is here added as to <em>heathens and publicans </em>confirms the interpretation which I have given. For <em>heathens and publicans </em>having been at that time regarded by the Jews with the greatest hatred and detestation, he compares to them unholy and irreclaimable men, who yield to no admonitions. Certainly he did not intend to enjoin them to avoid the society of <em>heathens</em>, of whom <em>the Church </em>was afterwards composed; nor is there any reason at the present day why believers should shrink from associating with <em>publicans </em>But in order that he might be more easily understood by the ignorant, Christ borrowed a mode of expression from what was then customary among his nation; <span class="cite-ref">(560)</span> and the meaning is, that we ought to have no intercourse with the despisers of <em>the Church </em>till they repent. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(555)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car arguer signifie convaincre par argumens, et remonstrer par bonnes raisons</span>;” — “for <em>to argue </em>signifies to convince by arguments, and to show by good reasons.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(556)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Or comment pourroit on </span><em class="lang fr-fr">arguer </em><span class="lang fr-fr">ou convaincre un homme, que ce qu’il a fait est mauvais</span> ?” — “Now how could we <em>argue </em>or convince a man that what he has done is wrong?” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(557)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Veu qu’il n’a pas voulu recevoir l’admonition qui luy a este faite en prive par deux ou trois</span>;” — “since he did not choose to receive the admonition which was given to him in private by two or three.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(558)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme aussi en d’autres passages il s’accomodi a ce qui estoit lors ordinaire, et use des termes communes</span>;” — “as also in other passages he adapts himself to what was then customary, and employs common terms.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(559)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne devoycnt estre receus a participer aux choses sacrees appartenantes au sarvice de Dieu</span>;” — “ought not to be admitted to take part in the sacred things belonging to the service of God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(560)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A use d’un terme convenable a la coustume du pays</span>;” — “used a term in accordance with the custom of the country.” </p></div></div>
