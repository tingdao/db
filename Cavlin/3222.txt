<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>And when he hath made an end of reconciling. </em>The mode of expiation with the other goat is now more clearly explained, viz., that it should be placed before God, and that the priest should lay his hands on its head, and confess the sins of the people, so that he may throw the curse on the goat itself. This, as I have said, was the only bloodless (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀναίματον</span>) sacrifice; yet it is expressly called an “offering,” <span class="cite-ref">(248)</span> with reference, however, to the slaying of the former goat, and was, therefore, as to its efficacy for propitiation, by no means to be separated from it. It was by no means reasonable that an innocent animal should be substituted in the place of men, to be exposed to the curse of God, except that believers might learn that they were in no wise competent to bear His judgment, nor could be delivered from it otherwise than by the transfer of their guilt and crime. For, since men feel that they are altogether overwhelmed by the wrath of God, which impends over them all, they vainly endeavor to lighten or shake off in various ways this intolerable burden; for no absolution is to be hoped for save by the interposition of a satisfaction; and it is not lawful to obtrude this according to man’s fancy, or, in their foolish arrogance, to seek in themselves for the price whereby their sins may be compensated for. Another means, therefore, of making atonement to God was revealed when Christ, “being made a curse for us,” transferred to Himself the sins which alienated men from God. (<span class="bvs">2Co_5:19</span>; <span class="bvs">Gal_3:13</span>.) The confession tended to humiliate the people, and thus acted as a stimulus to sincere repentance; since “the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_51:17</span>;) nor is it fit that any but the prostrate should be lifted up by God’s mercy, nor that any but those who voluntarily condemn themselves should be absolved. The accumulation of words tends to this, “all the iniquities, all their transgressions, all their sins,” that believers may not lightly only and as, a mere act of duty acknowledge themselves guilty before God, but rather that they should groan under the weight, of their guilt. Since now in Christ no special day in the year is prescribed in which the Church should confess its sins in a solemn ceremony, let believers learn, whenever they meet together in God’s name, humbly to submit themselves to voluntary self-condemnation, and to pray for pardon, as if the Spirit of God dictated a formulary for them; and so let each in private: conform himself to this rule. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(248)</span><em>C. </em>refers to his own translation, “tunc <em>offeret </em>hircum vivum.” Lorinus<em>in loco </em>says, “The Greek <span class="lang el-gr">προσάξει</span> signifies he shall bring or lead near, (<em>offeret </em>vel <em>adducet </em>) Although <span class="lang he-il">הקריב</span><em>hikriub, </em>is not infrequently rendered to <em>offer. </em></p></div></div>
