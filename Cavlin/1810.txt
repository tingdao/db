<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And the Lord gave </em><span class="cite-ref">(135)</span><em>the people favor. </em>Because the Israelites never could have hoped that the Egyptians, who had before rapaciously stripped them of everything, would become so kind and liberal to them, Moses declares that men’s hearts are turned this way or that by God. For, as the Psalm testifies, that the Egyptians were impelled by Him “to hate His people,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_105:25</span>,) that He might make way for their glorious deliverance; so He was able also to incline them in the opposite direction, that they should freely give what they had before harshly refused, and not without threats and blows. This doctrine is exceedingly useful to be known, because, when men are harsh and cruel to us, it: teaches us patience, whilst we are assured that the passions of wicked men only thus assail us, in so far as God would chastise our sins, and exercise and humble us. It affords also no little consolation to alleviate our pains, and seasonably arouses us to call upon God, that He would turn the minds of our enemies from brutality and unkindness to gentleness. It appears from many passages that this was ever the persuasion of all the pious, and unquestionably the expression of Jacob to his sons, “God Almighty give (<em>dabit</em>) you mercy before the man,” was founded on this general feeling. (<span class="bvs">Gen_43:14</span>.) But, since Scripture is full of such testimonies, let it suffice to have quoted this single one. Again, God does not always incline men to mercy, by the Spirit of regeneration, so that they should be changed from wolves to lambs; but sometimes by His secret inspiration He for a short time softens them though they know it not, as we read here of the Egyptians. In the second clause of the verse, where it is said, “Moreover the man Moses,” etc., an inferior and subordinate reason is given, which availed both to change the Egyptians as well as to encourage the Israelites, so that both of them reverently deferred to his words; for although this whole matter was governed by the power of God alone, still He did not act simply by Himself, but having chosen Moses as His minister, He assigned <span class="cite-ref">(136)</span> a certain charge to him. Hence the veneration which made the Egyptians as well as the Israelites obedient to him, that his labor might not be in vain. He only speaks, indeed, of the Egyptian nation, (for after having spoken of “the land” first, he adds two divisions, “Pharaoh’s servants,” i.e., the nobles and courtiers, and then “the common people,” for so in this place I understand the word “people;”) but we shall soon see that the miracles had had a good effect upon the Israelites also, that they should more readily believe and obey. But; this passage teaches us that God’s servants are often prized and honored, where yet faith in their doctrine is not possessed, for although the Egyptians reverence and highly esteem Moses, they do not therefore incline to seek <span class="cite-ref">(137)</span> after piety. And thus the wicked often fear God Himself, when influenced by particular circumstances, and yet do not devote themselves to His service. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(135)</span><em>Lat</em>. , “dabit.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(136)</span> “Il luy a laisse ce qui estoit de sa charge et vocation;” he left to him what pertained to his charge and calling. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(137)</span> “A craindre Dieu d’une droite affection.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
