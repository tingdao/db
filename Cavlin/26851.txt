<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Woman, behold thy son! </em><span class="cite-ref">(175)</span> As if he had said, “Henceforth I shall not be an inhabitant of the earth, so as to have it in my power to discharge to thee the duties of a <em>son; </em>and, therefore, I put this man in my room, that he may perform my office.” The same thing is meant, when he says to John, </p><p><em>Behold thy mother! </em>For by these words he charges him to treat her as a <em>mother, </em>and to take as much care of her as if she had been his own <em>mother. </em></p><p>In refraining from mentioning his <em>mother’s </em>name and in simply calling her <em>Woman! </em>some think that he did so, in order not to pierce her heart with a deeper wound. I do not object to this view; but there is another conjecture which is equally probable, that Christ intended to show that, after having completed the course of human life, he lays down the condition in which he had lived, and enters into the heavenly kingdom, where he will exercise dominion over angels and men; for we know that Christ was always accustomed to guard believers against looking at the flesh, and it was especially necessary that this should be done at his death. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(175)</span> “One who will take as much care of you as if he had been your son.” — <em>Beausobre. </em></p></div></div>
