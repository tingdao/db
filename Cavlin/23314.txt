<div class="comment-content"><p>This has the same object with the former doctrine. Believers ought to rely on Godâ€™s fatherly care, to expect that he will bestow upon them whatever they feel to be necessary, and not to torment themselves by unnecessary anxiety. </p><p>He forbids them to be <em>anxious, </em>or, as Luke has it, to <em>seek, </em>that is, to <em>seek </em>in the manner of those who look around them in every direction, without looking at God, on whom alone their eye ought to be fixed; who are never at ease, but when they have before their eyes an abundance of provisions; and who, not admitting that the protection of the world belongs to God, fret and tease themselves with perpetual uneasiness. </p></div>
