<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Thou hast destroyed the proud. </em>Others render it:, <em>Thou hast rebuked the proud; </em>a translation of which the Hebrew term <span class="lang he-il">גער</span><em>, gaar, </em>admits when the letter <span class="lang he-il">ב</span><em>, beth, </em>is joined with it in construction; but this being awaiting, it is better to render it <em>destroy </em><span class="cite-ref">(406)</span> It makes, however, little difference to the main drift of the passage, there being no doubt that the intention of the prophet is, to inform us that God’s judgments instructed him to apply his mind to the study of the law; and certainly this is an exercise which we ought on no account to defer till God visit us with chastisement.. But when we behold him taking vengeance upon the wicked, and the despisers of his word, we must be stupid, indeed, if his rod do not teach us wisdom; and, doubtless, it is an instance of special kindness on God’s part, to spare us, and only to terrify us from afar, that he may bring us to himself without injuring or chastising us at all. </p><p>It is not without reason that he denominates all unbelievers <em>proud, </em>because it is true faith alone which humbles us, and all rebellion is the offspring of pride. From this we learn how profitable it is to consider carefully and attentively the judgments of God, by which he overthrows such haughtiness. When the weak in faith see the wicked rise in furious. opposition against God, arrogantly casting off all restraint, and holding all religion in derision with impunity, they begin to question whether there be a God who sits as judge in heaven. God may, for a time, wink at this: by-and-bye, we witness him setting forth some indication of his judgment, to convince us that he hath not in vain uttered threatening against the violators of his law; and we ought to bear in mind that all who depart from him are reprobate. </p><p>Let it be carefully observed that,<em>by wandering from his commandments, </em>is not meant all kinds of transgression indiscriminately, but that unbridled licentiousness which proceeds from impious contempt of God. It is, indeed, given as a general sentence, that </p><p><em>“every </em>one is cursed who continueth not in all<LineBreak />things which are written,” <span class="bvs">Deu_27:26</span></p><p>But as Godwin his paternal kindness, bears with those who fail through infirmity of the flesh, so here we must understand these judgments to be expressly executed upon the wicked and reprobate; and their end, as Isaiah declares, is, </p><p><em>“ </em>that the inhabitants of the earth may learn righteousness,”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_26:9</span>) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(406)</span> “Maintenant veu qu’elle n’y est point adjoustee, le mot de Destruire y conviendra mieux.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
