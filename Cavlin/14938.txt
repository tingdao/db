<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing place </em>Here he compares his afflictions to a deep sink of mire, where there is still greater danger; for if a man fixes his feet upon a solid bottom, he may raise himself up, there having been many instances in which persons, placing their feet on the bottom, have by a sudden spring emerged and escaped the peril of the waters; but when a man finds himself once sunk in some slough or muddy river, it is all over with him, he has no means of saving himself. <span class="cite-ref">(69)</span> The Psalmist adduces additional circumstances in illustration of his afflicted condition. He declares that <em>he was inundated by the flowing of the waters; </em>an expression indicating the disorder and confusion which his distresses and persecutions produced. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(69)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme nous en voyons plusieurs qui donnans du pied au fond, de roideur trouvent facon d’eschapper le peril de l’eau: mais depuis qu’on se trouve une fois enfonce en quelque bourbier ou riviere limonneuse, c’est fait, il n’y a nul moyen de se sauver</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
