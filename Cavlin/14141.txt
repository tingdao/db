<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>For all his judgments were before me. </em>He now shows how he came to possess that unbending rectitude of character, by which he was enabled to act uprightly amidst so many and so grievous temptations, namely, because he always applied his mind to the study of the law of God. As Satan is daily making new assaults upon us, it is necessary for us to have recourse to arms, and it is meditation upon the Divine Law which furnishes us with armor to resist. Whoever, therefore, would desire to persevere in uprightness and integrity of life, let them learn to exercise themselves daily in the study of the word of God; for, whenever a man despises or neglects instruction, he easily falls into carelessness and stupidity, and all fear of God vanishes from his mind. I do not intend here to make any subtle distinction between these two words, <em>judgments </em>and <em>ordinances. </em>If, however, any person is inclined to make a distinction between them, the best distinction is to refer <em>judgments </em>to the second table of the law, and <em>ordinances, </em>or <em>statutes, </em>which in Hebrew are called <span class="lang he-il">חוכות</span>, <em>chukoth, </em>to the duties of piety and the exercises immediately connected with the worship of God. </p></div>
