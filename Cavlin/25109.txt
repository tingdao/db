<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_5:1</span><strong>.</strong><em>He stood near the lake. </em>Matthew and Mark, according to the usual custom of their language, call it <em>the sea of Galilee. </em>The proper name of this lake among the ancient Hebrews was <span class="lang he-il">כנרת</span>, (<em>Chinnereth</em>;) <span class="cite-ref">(338)</span> but, when the language became corrupted, the word was changed to <em>Gennesaret. </em>Profane authors call it <em>Gennesar; </em>and that part, which lay towards Galilee, was called by them <em>the sea of Galilee. </em>The bank, which adjoined to Tiberias, received its name from that city. Its breadth and situation will be more appropriately discussed in another place. Let us now come to the fact here related. </p><p>Luke says, that Christ entered into a ship which belonged to Peter, and <em>withdrew to a moderate distance from the land, </em>that he might more conveniently address from it the multitudes, who flocked from various places to hear him; and that, after discharging the office of teaching, he exhibited a proof of his divine power by a miracle. It was no unusual thing, indeed, that fishers cast their nets, on many occasions, with little advantage: and that all their fruitless toil was afterwards recompensed by one successful throw. But it was proved to be a miracle by this circumstance, that they had taken nothing during the whole night, (which, however, is more suitable for catching fish,) and that suddenly <em>a great multitude of fishes </em>was collected into their nets, sufficient to fill the ships. Peter and his companions, therefore, readily conclude that a <em>take, </em>so far beyond the ordinary quantity, was not accidental, but was bestowed on them by a divine interposition. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(338)</span><em>Chinnereth </em>occurs in Joshua, (<span class="bvs">Jos_19:35</span>,) as the name of an adjoining city, from which the lake probably derived its name. In the French copy, our author gives it <em>Cinerot, </em>or, as we have it, (<span class="bvs">Jos_11:2</span>,) <em>Chinneroth. </em>But that word contains a <em>Vau, </em>which is here wanting: though it must be owned that, when it is connected with a <em>Cholem </em>point, that letter is often inserted, or left out, according to the pleasure of the writer. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
