But we ought especially to notice the latter clause, when he says that they became <em>companions</em>, or associates of the godly in their persecutions; for as it is Christ’s cause for which all the godly contend, and as it is what their contend for in common, whatever one of them suffers, all the rest ought to transfer, as it were, to themselves; and this is what ought by all means to be done by us, unless we would separate ourselves from Christ himself. <span class="cite-ref">(193)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(192)</span> The words may be rendered, “When ye were publicly exposed to reproaches and afflictions,” or, to revilings and persecutions.

In <span class="bvs">Mat_23:30</span><span class="lang el-gr">, κοινωνοὶ αὐτῶν </span> is rendered, “partakers with them,” or sharers with them; and so it might be rendered here, “sharers with those who were so treated,” i.e., sharers in reproach and suffering. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
