<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>45.</strong><em>That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven. </em>When he expressly declares, that no man will be a child of God, unless he <em>loves those who hate him, </em>who shall dare to say, that we are not bound to observe this doctrine? The statement amounts to this, “Whoever shall wish to be accounted a Christian, let him <em>love his enemies.” </em>It is truly horrible and monstrous, that the world should have been covered with such thick darkness, for three or four centuries, as not to see that it is an express command, and that every one who neglects it is struck out of the number of the children of God. </p><p>It ought to be observed that, when the example of God is held out for our imitation, this does not imply, that it would be becoming in us to do whatever God does. He frequently punishes the wicked, and drives the wicked out of the world. In this respect, he does not desire us to imitate him: for the judgment of the world, which is his prerogative, does not belong to us. But it is his will, that we should imitate his fatherly goodness and liberality. This was perceived, not only by heathen philosophers, but by some wicked despisers of godliness, who have made this open confession, that in nothing do men resemble God more than in doing good. In short, Christ assures us, that this will be a mark of our adoption, if we are <em>kind to the unthankful and evil. </em>And yet you are not to understand, that our liberality makes us the children of God: but the same Spirit, who is the <em>witness, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_8:16</span>,) <em>earnest, </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_1:14</span>,) and <em>seal, </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_4:30</span>,) of our free adoption, corrects the wicked affections of the flesh, which are opposed to charity. Christ therefore proves from the effect, that none are the children of God, but those who resemble him in gentleness and kindness. </p><p>Luke says, <em>and you shall be the children of the Highest. </em>Not that any man acquires this honor for himself, or begins to be a <em>child of God, </em>when he <em>loves his enemies; </em>but because, when it is intended to excite us to do what is right, Scripture frequently employs this manner of speaking, and represents as a reward the free gifts of God. The reason is, he looks at the design of our calling, which is, that, in consequence of the likeness of God having been formed anew in us, we may live a devout and holy life. <em>He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. </em>He quotes two instances of the divine kindness toward us, which are not only well known to us, but common to all: and this very participation excites us the more powerfully to act in a similar manner towards each other, though, by a <em>synecdoche, </em><span class="cite-ref">(422)</span> he includes a vast number of other favors. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(422)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien qu'il comprend sous ces deux d'autres infinis tesmoignages, par une figure dont nous avons souvent parle, nommee Synecdoche</span>.” — “Though, under these two, he includes innumerable other testimonies, by a figure, of which we have frequently spoken, called <em>Synecdoche.” </em></p></div></div>
