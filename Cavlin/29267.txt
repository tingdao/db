<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>That he would give to you. </em>Paul wishes that the Ephesians should be <em>strengthened; </em>and yet he had already bestowed on their piety no mean commendation. But believers have never advanced so far as not to need farther growth. The highest perfection of the godly in this life is an earnest desire to make progress. This <em>strengthening, </em>he tells us, is the work of the <em>Spirit; </em>so that it does not proceed from man’s own ability. The increase, as well as the commencement, of everything good in us, comes from the Holy Spirit. That it is the gift of Divine grace, is evident from the expression used, <em>that he would give to you </em>This the Papists utterly deny. They maintain that the <em>second </em>grace is bestowed upon us, according as we have individually deserved it, by making a proper use of the <em>first </em>grace. But let us unite with Paul in acknowledging that it is the “gift” of the grace of God, not only that we have begun to run well, but that we advance; not only that we have been born again, but that we grow from day to day. </p><p><em>According to the riches of his glory. </em>These words are intended to express still more strongly the doctrine of Divine grace. They may be explained in two ways: either, <em>according to his glorious riches, </em>making the genitive, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, supply the place of an adjective, — or, <em>according to his rich and abundant glory. </em>The word <em>glory </em>will thus be put for <em>mercy, </em>in accordance with an expression which he had formerly used, “to the praise of the glory of his grace.” (<span class="bvs">Eph_1:6</span>) I prefer the latter view. </p><p><em>In the inner man. </em>By <em>the inner man, </em>Paul means the soul, and whatever relates to the spiritual life of the soul; as the <em>outward </em>man denotes the body, with everything that belongs to it, — health, honors, riches, vigor, beauty, and everything of that nature. “Though our outward man perish, yet our inward man is renewed day by day;” that is, if in worldly matters we decay, our spiritual life becomes more and more vigorous. (<span class="bvs">2Co_4:16</span>) The prayer of Paul, that the saints may be <em>strengthened, </em>does not mean that they may be eminent and flourishing in the world, but that, with respect to the kingdom of God, their minds may be made strong by Divine power. </p></div>
