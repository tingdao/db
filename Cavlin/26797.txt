<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Then the band of soldiers and the captain. </em>It might be thought strange that Christ, who laid the soldiers prostrate on the ground by a single word, now allows himself to be <em>taken; </em>for if he intended at length to surrender to his enemies, what need was there for performing such a miracle? But the demonstration of divine power was advantageous in two respects; for, first, it serves to take away the offense, that we may not think that Christ yielded as if he had been overcome by weakness; and, secondly, it proves that in dying he was altogether voluntary. So far as it was useful, therefore, he asserted his power against his enemies; but when it was necessary to obey the Father, he restrained himself, that he might be offered as a sacrifice. But let us remember that the body of the Son of God was bound, that our souls might be loosed from the cords of sin and of Satan. </p></div>
