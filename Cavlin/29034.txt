<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>The signs of an Apostle </em>By the <em>signs of an Apostle </em>he means — the seals, that tend to confirm the evidence of his Apostleship, or, at least, for the proofs and evidences of it. “God has confirmed my Apostleship among you to such a degree, that it stands in no need of proof being adduced.” The <em>first sign </em>he makes mention of is <em>patience </em>— either because he had remained invincible, <span class="cite-ref">(925)</span> by nobly withstanding all the assaults of Satan and his enemies, and on no occasion giving way; or because, regardless of his own distinction, he suffered all injuries patiently, endured in silence countless grievances, <span class="cite-ref">(926)</span> and, by patience, overcame indignities. <span class="cite-ref">(927)</span> For a virtue so heroic is, as it were, a heavenly seal, by which the Lord marks out his Apostles. </p><p>He assigns the <em>second </em>place to <em>miracles, </em>for while he makes mention of <em>signs </em>and <em>wonders </em>and <em>mighty deeds, </em>he makes use of <em>three </em>terms, as he does elsewhere, (<span class="bvs">2Th_2:9</span>,) for expressing one and the same thing. Now he calls them <em>signs, </em>because they are not empty shows, but are appointed for the instruction of <em>mankind </em>— <em>wonders, </em>because they ought, by their novelty, to arouse men, and strike them with astonishment — and <em>powers </em>or <em>mighty deeds, </em>because they are more signal tokens of Divine power, <span class="cite-ref">(928)</span> than what we behold in the ordinary course of nature. Farther, we know that this was the main design of miracles, when the gospel began to be preached — that its doctrine might have greater authority given to it. Hence, the more that any one was endowed with the power of working miracles, so much the more was his ministry confirmed, as has been stated in the fifteenth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. <span class="cite-ref">(929)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(925)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Il a tousiours demure inuincible, et ferme sans se reculer</span>;” — “He has always remained invincible and firm, without shrinking back.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(926)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il a laisse passer beaucoup de fascheries sans en faire semblant de </span><em class="lang fr-fr">rien </em>;” — “He has allowed many grievances to pass, without seeming to take any notice of them.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(927)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Beaucoup de lasches tours</span>;” — “Many base tricks.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(928)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Ce sont exemples et tesmoignages plus excellent et euidens de la vertu Diuine</span>;” — “Those are signal and manifest instances and evidences of Divine power.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(929)</span> Calvin seems to refer here more particularly to the observations made by him, when commenting on <span class="bvs">Rom_15:18</span>. “<em>Hie </em>nobilis est locus de miraculorum usu: nempe ut reverentiam obedientiamque Deo apud homines comparent. Sic apud Marcum (<span class="bvs">Mar_16:20</span>,) legis, Dominum <em>confirmasse doetrinam subsequentibus signis. </em>Sic Lucas in Actis (<span class="bvs">Act_14:3</span>,) narrat, Dominum <em>per miracula testimonium reddidisse sermoni gratiae suoe </em><em>; </em>” — “This is an admirable passage in reference to the use of miracles — that they may secure among men reverence and obedience towards God. Thus you read in <span class="bvs">Mar_16:20</span>, that the Lord <em>confirmed their doctrine by signs following. </em>So also Luke, in <span class="bvs">Act_14:3</span>, relates that the Lord <em>by miracles gave testimony to the word.of his grace. </em>” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
