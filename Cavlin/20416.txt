<div class="comment-content"><p>We see that this is a repetition, but for vengeances he now mentions <em>reproaches </em>And in this way he sought again to turn God to mercy; for when he brings no aid, he seems to close his eyes and to render his ears deaf; but when he attends to our evils, he then soon brings help. The Prophet, then, having said that God saw, now refers to hearing: he had heard their reproaches. Adopting a language not strictly proper, he adds, that he had heard their thoughts; though he speaks not only of their secret counsels, but also of all the wicked conspiracies by which his enemies had contrived to ruin him. <span class="cite-ref">(203)</span> He adds, — </p><p><strong>(203)</strong> There is no necessity, as some have supposed, of making <span class="lang he-il">לי</span> in the former verse, and <span class="lang he-il">עלי</span> in this verse, the same. The difference is occasioned by the verbs “thou hast seen,” and, “thou hast heard.” God had seen the thoughts or purposes effected “against” him; and he had heard the purposes formed “concerning” him. He refers first to the purposes carried into effect, and then, as it is common in the prophets, he refers to the purposes previously formed respecting him. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
