<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>For he was a good man. </em>Barnabas is commended with the commendation of the Holy Ghost; yet we must know that there was respect had not so much of him as of us. For all those are condemned of ungodliness and malice who envy other men’s labors, and are grieved when they see the same have good success. </p><p>Also we must note the epithet used in the description of a <em>good man, full of the Holy Ghost, full of faith. </em>For after that he had said that he was an upright and good man, he showed from what fountain this goodness did flow; that, abandoning the affections of the flesh, he did, with all his heart, embrace godliness, having the Spirit to be his guide. But why doth he separate faith from the Spirit, whose gift it is? I answer, that it is not named severally, as if it were a diverse thing, but it is rather set forth as a principal token, whereby it might appear that Barnabas was full of the Holy Ghost. </p><p><em>There was a great multitude added. </em>Though the number of the godly was already great, yet Luke saith that it was increased by Barnabas’ coming. Thus doth the building of the Church go forward when one doth help another with mutual consent, and one doth gently allow <span class="cite-ref">(741)</span> that which another hath begun. </p><p><strong>(741)</strong> “Candide... probat,” candidly approves. </p></div>
