<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>There shall not a hand touch it. </em><span class="cite-ref">(215)</span> They ignorantly pervert the meaning who resolve the particle <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, be, into the adversative else; as if Moses forbade them to touch the mountain with the hand, under penalty of stoning. <span class="cite-ref">(216)</span> Those also are far from the truth who think that what is ordained is, that one should not follow the other, or that none should stretch forth his hand to the transgressors for their help. Moses referred to something altogether different; for in order to render more detestable those who, by rash advances, should violate the limits placed by God, he commanded them to be killed afar off by stones or darts; as if whosoever should touch them, even with a finger, would contract pollution. It is, then, as if he commanded them to be avoided as being accursed, lest they should infect others by their contagion. Therefore there is an antithesis between different kinds of death, viz., to smite with the sword or to shoot through with darts, and to strike with the hand. But lest the people should consider themselves rejected, and thus being offended by the ignominy of their repulse, should abandon their love and desire for the Law, He permits their ascent conditionally, viz., when the sound of the trumpet shall have been protracted for a long time, or it shall have done sounding. Thus there was no ground for complaining of the limitation which God had appointed for their safety. </p><p><strong>(215)</strong> There shall not a hand touch him, (eum.) — <em>Lat</em>. </p><p>Curiously enough, the French translation contradicts the Commentary, — “Nulle main ne la touchera <em>(i.e</em>. , la montagne) <em>autrement </em>il sera lapide, etc.” Our translation, too, seems to carry this meaning. Dathe’s Version is in accordance with Calvin’s view, — “Nec tamen ejusmodi transgressorem mann esse tangendum (sc. ut vi adhibita ejiceretur e cancellis) sed lapidibus obruendum, etc.” Hugo de S. Victor, in Willet, gives yet another conjecture, — “The hand of man shall not need to be upon him; sed intelligitur lapidum ictibus in eum divinitus volitantibus necandus.” </p><p><strong>(216)</strong> Aben-Ezra sic exponit: Qui praescriptum terminum transierit in hunc nemo injiciat manus, nemo illum sequatur intra constitutos limites, sed projiciant ad eum lapides, aut feriant eum jaculis.<em>S. M. </em>— <em>W. </em></p></div>
