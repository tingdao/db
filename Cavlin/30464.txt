<div class="comment-content"><p>When the faithful see that it is well with the wicked, they are necessarily tempted to be envious; and this is a very dangerous trial; for present happiness is what all desire. Hence the Spirit of God carefully dwells on this, in many places, as well as in the thirty-seventh Psalm, lest the faithful should envy the prosperity of the ungodly. The same is what Peter speaks of, for he shews that afflictions ought to be calmly borne by the children of God, when they compare the lot of others with their own. But he takes it as granted that God is the judge of the world, and that, therefore, no one can escape his hand with impunity. He hence infers, that a dreadful vengeance will soon overtake those whose condition seems now favorable. The design of what he says, as I have already stated, is to shew that the children of God should not faint under the bitterness of present evils, but that they ought, on the contrary, calmly to bear their afflictions for a short time, as the issue will be salvation, while the ungodly will have to exchange a fading and fleeting prosperity for eternal perdition. </p><p>But the argument is from the less to the greater; for if God spares not his own children whom he loves and who obey him, how dreadful will be his severity against enemies and such as are rebellious! There is, then, nothing better than to obey the Gospel, so that God may kindly correct us by his paternal hand for our salvation. </p><p><strong>18</strong><em>And if the righteous </em>It has been thought that this sentence is taken from <span class="bvs">Pro_11:31</span>; for the Greek translators have thus rendered what Solomon says, </p><p>“Behold, the just shall on the earth be recompensed; how much more the ungodly and the sinner?” </p><p>Now, whether Peter intended to quote this passage, or repeated a common and a proverbial saying, (which seems to me more probable,) <span class="cite-ref">(51)</span> the meaning is, that God’s judgment would be dreadful against the ungodly, since the way to salvation was so thorny and difficult to the elect. And this is said, lest we should securely indulge ourselves, but carefully proceed in our course, and lest we should also seek the smooth and easy road, the end of which is a terrible precipice. </p><p>But when he says, that a <em>righteous man is scarcely saved, </em>he refers to the difficulties of the present life, for our course in the world is like a dangerous sailing between many rocks, and exposed to many storms and tempests; and thus no one arrives at the port, except he who has escaped from [a] thousand deaths. It is in the meantime certain that we are guided by God’s hand, and that we are in no danger of shipwreck as long as we have him as our pilot. </p><p>Absurd, then, are those interpreters who think that we shall be hardly and with difficulty saved, when we shall come before God in judgment; for it is the present and not the future time that Peter refers to; nor does he speak of God’s strictness or rigour, but shews how many and what arduous difficulties must be surmounted by the Christian before he reaches the goal. <em>Sinner </em>here means a <em>wicked </em>man <span class="cite-ref">(52)</span> and the righteous are not those who are altogether perfect in righteousness, but who strive to live righteously. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(51)</span> It certainly <em>appears </em>as a quotation, as the words are literally the same. It is to be observed that the Hebrew has “on earth,” which seems to confirm the view that saved here refers to deliverances from the troubles, trials, and persecutions, which the righteous have to go through during life; and that <em>scarcely, </em>or hardly, or with difficulty, as rendered by <em>Doddridge </em>and <em>Macknight, </em>is to be limited to the time of the Christian’s course in this world; for, as <em>Macknight </em>observes, the Apostle speaks in his Second Epistle of an abundant entrance into the heavenly kingdom being vouchsafed to all faithful Christians.
