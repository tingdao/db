<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>I speak not according to commandment </em>Again he qualifies his exhortation, by declaring that he did not at all intend to compel them, as if he were imposing any necessity upon them, for that is to <em>speak according to commandment, </em>when we enjoin any thing definite, and peremptorily require that it shall be done. Should any one ask — “Was it not lawful for him to prescribe what he had by commandment of the Lord?” The answer is easy — that God, it is true, everywhere charges us to help the necessities of our brethren, but he nowhere specifies the sum; <span class="cite-ref">(669)</span> that, after making a calculation, we might divide between ourselves and the poor. He nowhere binds us to circumstances of times, or persons, but calls us to take the rule of love as our guide. </p><p>At the same time, Paul does not here look to what is lawful for him, or unlawful, but says, that he does not <em>command </em>as if he reckoned that they required to be constrained by <em>command </em>and requirement, as though they refused to do their duty, unless shut up to it by necessity. He assigns, on the other hand, two reasons why he, notwithstanding, stirs them up to duty: <em>first, </em>Because the concern felt by him for the saints compels him to do so; and, <em>secondly, </em>Because he is desirous, that the love of the Corinthians should be made known to all. For I do not understand Paul to have been desirous to be assured of their love, (as to which he had already declared himself to be perfectly persuaded,) <span class="cite-ref">(670)</span> but he rather wished that all should have evidence of it. At the same time, the first clause in reference to the anxiety of others, admits of two meanings — either that he felt an anxiety as to the individuals, which did not allow him to be inactive, or that, yielding to the entreaties of others, who had the matter at heart, he spoke not so much from his own feeling, as at the suggestion of others. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(669)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien nous leur deuons donner</span>;” — “How much we ought to give them.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(670)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Bien persuade et asseure</span>;” — “Well persuaded and assured.” </p></div></div>
