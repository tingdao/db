<div class="comment-content"><p>Here Jeremiah complains of the obstinate contempt of the people; he found them not only uncourteous but even petulant towards God, so that they hesitated not to discredit all prophecies, to despise the promises, and boldly to reject all threatenings. The Prophet had often threatened them; and when God delayed the time, they made a wrong use of his forbearance, as it is commonly the case with the reprobate. Nor did they deem it enough even to add sins to sins, but they openly and petulantly provoked God, “<em>Where is the word? </em>many years have now elapsed since thou hast continually spoken of war, of famine, and of pestilence; but we still remain quiet, and God spares us; where then is the <em>word of Jehovah</em>, which thou hast announced?” </p><p>We now then see how great was the wilfulness of this people, for the teaching of Jeremiah became not only useless but was treated with ridicule. They had however heard much before from the mouth of Isaiah, </p><p>“Alas! when the Lord calls you to ashes and sackcloth, ye say, “Let us eat and drink, to-morrow we shall die.” “As I live, saith the Lord, not forgiven to you shall be this iniquity.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_22:12</span>.) </p><p>God then had sworn by his own glory that their sin would be inexpiable, because they continued obstinately in their vices, and were in no degree terrified by the threatenings of the prophets. We however see that they ever became worse and worse. Isaiah was dead when they thus spoke in contempt and mockery, <em>Where is the word of Jehovah? let it now come</em>, as though they designedly provoked God, like one who despises his enemy, and says, “Oh! thou art indeed to be dreaded, if thou art to be believed; let us now see thy power, shew to us what thou canst do.” Thus contemptibly did they utter their scoffs, when God by his servants made known to them the approaching ruin which they deserved. We see, in short, that the Prophet shews here that they had come to a hopeless state. <span class="cite-ref">(182)</span> It follows — </p><p><strong>(182)</strong> The <em>Targum </em>thus paraphrases the verse, — </p><p>Behold they say to me “Where is what thou hast prophesied in the name of the Lord? let it be now confirmed.” </p><p>Their language was similar to that of those mentioned in <span class="bvs">2Pe_3:4</span>. —<em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
