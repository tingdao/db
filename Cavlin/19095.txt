When men go to a chief city from any quarter, it is always ascending. When on their march, they encouraged one another to ascend by mid-day, as <span class="lang he-il">ב</span> may be rendered, but the day declined before they reached the city; then they encouraged each other to continue their march in the night, — </p><p>Proclaim ye against her war: Rise, and let us ascend by mid-day. — Alas for us! for declined has the day, For extended have become the shadows of the evening: Arise, and let us ascend by night, And destroy her palaces. </p><p>The last word is rendered “foundations” by the <em>Septuagint</em>, — “houses” by the <em>Vulgate</em>, — and “palaces” by the <em>Targum</em>. This is an instance of the loose way in which the versions were often made. </p><p>To “sanctify war,“ is not to prepare it, but to proclaim it, as <em>Calvin </em>says, by a solemn ceremony. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
