<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Of judgment. </em>Those who understand the word (<span class="lang el-gr">κρίσεως</span>) <em>judgment </em>as signifying <em>condemnation</em>, have some argument on their side; for Christ immediately adds, that <em>the prince of this world hath been judged </em>But I prefer a different opinion, namely, that, the light of the Gospel having been kindled, <em>the Spirit </em>manifests that the world has been brought into a state of good order by the victory of Christ, by which he overturned the authority of Satan; as if he had said, that this is a true restoration, by which all things are reformed, when Christ alone holds the kingdom, having subdued and triumphed over Satan. <em>Judgment</em>, therefore, is contrasted with what is confused and disordered, or, to express it briefly, it is the opposite (<span class="lang el-gr">τὢς ἀταξίας</span>) of <em>confusion</em>, or, we might call it <em>righteousness</em>, a sense which it often bears in Scripture. The meaning therefore is, that Satan, so long as he retains the government, perplexes and disturbs all things, so that there is an unseemly and disgraceful confusion in the works of God; but when he is stripped of his tyranny by Christ, then the world is restored, and good order is seen to reign. Thus <em>the Spirit convinces the world of judgment</em>; that is, having vanquished the prince of wickedness, Christ restores to order those things which formerly were torn and decayed. </p></div>
