<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>And, lo, there was a man in Jerusalem </em>The design of this narrative is to inform us that, though nearly the whole nation was profane and irreligious, and despised God, yet that a few worshippers of God remained, and that Christ was known to such persons from his earliest infancy. These were “the remnant” of whom Paul says, that they were preserved “according to the election of grace,” (<span class="bvs">Rom_11:5</span>.) Within this small band lay the Church of God; though the priests and scribes, with as much pride as falsehood, claimed for themselves the title of the Church. The Evangelist mentions no more than two, who recognised Christ at Jerusalem, when he was brought into the temple. These were Simeon and Anna. We must speak first of Simeon. </p><p>As to his condition in life we are not informed: he may have been a person of humble rank and of no reputation. Luke bestows on him the commendation of being <em>just </em>and <em>devout; </em>and adds, that he had the gift of prophecy: for <em>the Holy Spirit was upon him. Devotion </em>and <em>Righteousness </em>related to the two tables of the law, and are the two parts of which an upright life consists. It was a proof of his being <em>a devout man, </em>that he <em>waited for the consolation of Israel: </em>for no true worship of God can exist without the hope of salvation, which depends on the faith of his promises, and particularly on the restoration promised through Christ. Now, since an expectation of this sort is commended in Simeon as an uncommon attainment, we may conclude, that there were few in that age, who actually cherished in their hearts the hope of redemption. All had on their lips the name of the Messiah, and of prosperity under the reign of David: but hardly any one was to be found, who patiently endured present afflictions, relying on the consolatory assurance, that the redemption of the Church was at hand. As the eminence of Simeon’s piety was manifested by its supporting his mind in the hope of the promised salvation, so those who wish to prove themselves the children of God, will breathe out unceasing prayers for the promised redemption. For we, “have need of patience” (<span class="bvs">Heb_10:36</span>) till the last coming of Christ. </p><p><em>And the Holy Spirit was upon him </em>The Evangelist does not speak of “the Spirit of adoptions” (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:15</span>,) which is common to all the children of God, though not in an equal degree, but of the peculiar gift of prophecy. This appears more clearly from the next verse and the following one, in which it is said, that he <em>received a revelation </em><span class="cite-ref">(194)</span><em>from the Holy Spirit, </em>and that, by the guidance of the same Spirit, <em>he came into the temple </em>Though Simeon had no distinction of public office, he was adorned with eminent gifts, — with piety, with a blameless life, with faith and prophecy. Nor can it be doubted, that this divine intimation, which he received in his individual and private capacity, was intended generally for the confirmation of all the godly. Jesus is called <em>the Lord’s Christ, </em>because he was <em>anointed </em><span class="cite-ref">(195)</span> by the Father, and, at the same time that he received the Spirit, received also the title, of King and Priest. Simeon is said to have come into the temple by <em>the Spirit; </em>that is, by a secret movement and undoubted revelation, that he might meet Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(196)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(194)</span> “Responsum;” — “revelation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(195)</span> It is scarcely necessary to remind the reader, that the simple meaning of the Hebrew word <em>Messiah, </em>and of the Greek word <em>Christ, </em>is <em>Anointed; </em>and that <em>the Lord's Christ </em>means <em>the Lord's Anointed, </em>—<em>a </em>designation which, as has been already remarked, ( p. 92, note 2,) was familiarly applied to David and his successors on the throne for many generations, (<span class="bvs">2Sa_19:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Lam_4:20</span>,) but was afterwards restricted to “David’s son,” and “David’s Lord,” (<span class="bvs">Mat_22:45</span>,) whom Daniel emphatically calls <em>the Messiah, the Anointed, </em>(<span class="bvs">Dan_9:25</span>.) — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(196)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C'est a dire, par un mouvement secret et certaine revelation du Sainct Esprit, afin de s'y rencontrer a l'heure que Christ y estoit</span>.” — “That is to say, by a secret movement and certain revelation of the Spirit, in order that he might arrive at the hour when Christ was there.” </p></div></div>
