<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>It is written. </em>Christ quotes two passages taken out of two Prophets; the one from <span class="bvs">Isa_56:7</span>, and the other from <span class="bvs">Jer_7:11</span>. What <em>was written </em>by Isaiah agreed with the circumstances of the time; for in that passage is predicted the calling of the Gentiles. Isaiah, therefore, promises that God will grant, not only that the temple shall recover its original splendor, but likewise that <em>all nations shall flow to it, </em>and that the whole world shall agree in true and sincere piety. <span class="cite-ref">(14)</span> He speaks, no doubt, metaphorically; for the spiritual worship of God, which was to exist under the reign of Christ, is shadowed out by the prophets under the figures of the law. Certainly this was never fulfilled, that all nations went up to Jerusalem to worship God; and therefore, when he declares that the temple will be <em>a place of prayer for all nations, </em>this mode of expression is equivalent to saying, that the nations must be gathered into the Church of God, that with one voice they may worship the true God, along with the children of Abraham. But since he mentions <em>the temple, </em>so far as it then was the visible abode of religion, Christ justly reproaches the Jews with having applied it to totally different purposes from those to which it had been dedicated. The meaning therefore is: God intended that this temple should exist till no as a sign on which all his worshippers should fix their eyes; and how base and wicked is it to profane it by thus turning it into a market? </p><p>Besides, in the time of Christ, that <em>temple </em>was actually a <em>house of prayer; </em>that is, so long as the Law, with its shadows, remained in force. But it began to be <em>a house of prayer for all nations, </em>when out of it resounded the doctrine of the Gospel, by which the whole world was to be united in one common faith. And though shortly afterwards it was totally overthrown, yet even in the present day the fulfillment of this prophecy is manifest; for, since </p><p>out of Zion, went forth the law,<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_2:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Mic_4:2</span>,) </p><p>those who wish to pray aright must look to that beginning. I do acknowledge that there is no distinction of places, for it is the will of the Lord that men should call upon Him everywhere; but as believers, who profess to worship the God of Israel, are said to </p><p>speak in the language of Canaan, (<span class="bvs">Isa_19:18</span>,) </p><p>so they are also said to come <em>into the temple, </em>because out of it flowed the true religion. It is likewise the fountain of the waters, which, enlarged to an astonishing degree within a short period, flow in great abundance, and give life to those that drink them, as Ezekiel (<span class="bvs">Eze_47:9</span>) mentions, <span class="cite-ref">(15)</span> which, going out from the temple, spread, as Zechariah (<span class="bvs">Zec_14:8</span>) says, from the rising to the setting sun. Though in the present day we make use of <em>temples </em>(or <em>churches</em>) for holding the holy assemblies, yet it is for a different reason; for, since Christ was manifested, no outward representation of him under shadows is held out to us, such as the fathers anciently had under the Law. </p><p>It must also be observed, that by the word <em>prayer </em>the prophet expresses the whole worship of God; for, though there was at that time a great variety and abundance of religious rites, yet God intended briefly to show what was the object of all those rites; namely, that they might worship him spiritually, as is more clearly expressed in the fiftieth psalm, where also God comprehends under <em>prayer </em>all the exercises of religion. </p><p><em>But you have made it a den of robbers. </em>Christ means that the complaint of Jeremiah (<span class="bvs">Jer_7:11</span>) applied equally well to his own time, in which the temple was not less corrupted. The prophet directs his reproof against hypocrites, who, through confidence in <em>the temple, </em>allowed themselves greater liberty in sinning. For, as it was the design of God to employ outward symbols, as a sort of rudiments, for instructing the Jews in true religion, so they satisfied themselves with the empty pretense of <em>the temple, </em>as if it were enough to give their attention to outward ceremonies; just as it is customary with hypocrites to </p><p>change the truth of God into a lie (<span class="bvs">Rom_1:25</span>.). </p><p>But the prophet exclaims that God is not bound to <em>the temple, </em>or tied to ceremonies, and therefore that they falsely boast of the name of <em>the temple, </em>which they <em>had made a den of robbers. </em>For as <em>robbers </em>in their <em>dens </em>sin with greater hardihood, because they trust that they will escape punishment, so by means of a false covering of godliness hypocrites grow more bold, so that they almost hope to deceive God. Now as the metaphor of <em>a den </em>includes all corruptions, Christ properly applies the passage of the prophet to the present occasion. </p><p>Mark adds, that Christ gave orders <em>that no man should carry a vessel through the temple; </em>that is, he did not permit any thing to be seen there that was inconsistent with religious services; for by the word <em>vessel </em>the Hebrews denote any kind of utensil. In short, Christ took away whatever was at variance with the reverence and majesty of the temple. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(14)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A la vraye et droiet cognoissanc de Dieu</span>;” — “in the true and right knowledge of God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(15)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et aussi c’est ceste source des quatre fleuves desquels Ezekiel</span> (<span class="bvs">Eze_47:2</span>) <span class="lang fr-fr">parle, qui doyvent arrouser les quatre coins du monde</span>;” — “and this is also the source of the four rivers of which Ezekiel (<span class="bvs">Eze_47:2</span>) speaks, which are to water the four quarters of the world.” </p></div></div>
