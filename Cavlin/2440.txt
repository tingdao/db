<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>And when the people saw that Moses</em>. In this narrative we perceive the detestable impiety of the people, their worse than base ingratitude, and their monstrous madness, mixed with stupidity. For their sakes Moses had been carried up above the state of terrestrial life, that he might receive the injunctions of his mission, and that his authority might be beyond the reach of controversy. They perversely declare that they know not what has become of him, nay, they speak contemptuously of him as of a person unknown to them. It is for this that Stephen severely blames them, <span class="cite-ref">(324)</span> This is that Moses (he says) whom your fathers rejected, though he was the minister of their salvation. (<span class="bvs">Act_7:35</span>.) They confess that he had been their deliverer, yet they cannot tolerate his absence for a little time, nor are they affected with any reverence towards him, unless they have him before their eyes. Moreover, <span class="cite-ref">(325)</span> although God offered Himself as if present with them by day and by night in the pillar of fire, and in the cloud, they still despised so illustrious and lively an image of His glory and power, and desire to have Him represented to them in the shape of a dead idol. For what could they mean by saying, “make us gods which shall go before us?” Could they not see the pillar of fire and the cloud? Was not God’s paternal solicitude abundantly conspicuous every day in the manna? Was he not near them in ways innumerable </p><p>Yet, accounting as nothing all these true, and sure, and manifest tokens of God’s presence, they desire to have a figure which may satisfy their vanity. And this was the original source of idolatry, that men supposed that they could not otherwise possess God, unless by subjecting Him to their own imagination. Nothing, however, can be more preposterous; for since the minds of men and all their senses sink far below the loftiness of God, when they try to bring Him down to the measure of their own weak capacity, they travesty Him. In a word, whatever man’s reason conceives of Him is mere falsehood; and nevertheless, this depraved longing can hardly be repressed, so fiercely does it burst out. They are also influenced by pride and presumption, when they do not hesitate to drag down His glory as it were from heaven, and to subject it to earthly elements. We now understand what motive chiefly impelled the Israelites to this madness in demanding that a figure of God should be set before them, viz., because they measured Him by their own senses. Wonderful indeed was their stupidity, to desire that a God should be made by mortal men, as if he could be a god, or could deserve to be accounted such who obtains his divinity at the caprice of men. Still, it is not probable that they were so absurd as to desire a new god to be created for them; but they call “gods” by metonymy those outward images, by looking at which the superstitious imagine that God is near them. And this is evident from the fact, that not only the noun but the verb also is in the plural number; for although they were satisfied with one God, still they in a manner cut Him to pieces by their various representations of Him. Nevertheless, however they may deceive themselves under this or that pretext, they still desire to be creators of God. </p><p>Those who suppose that <em>confusion </em>is implied by the word “delayed,” are, in my opinion, mistaken; for, although the word <span class="lang he-il">בשש</span>, <em>boshesh</em>, with its third radical doubled, is derived from <span class="lang he-il">בוש</span>, <em>bush</em>, which means <em>to be ashamed</em>, still it is clear from <span class="bvs">Jud_5:28</span>, that it is used simply for <em>to delay</em>, where it is said, in the address of the mother of Sisera, “Why <span class="cite-ref">(326)</span> does his chariot delay (or defer) to come?” </p><p>Hence we may understand that hypocrites so fear God as that religion vanishes from their hearts, unless there be some task-master (<em>exactor</em>) standing by them to keep them in the path of duty. They duly obeyed Moses and reverenced his person; but, because they were only influenced by his presence, as soon as they were deprived of it they ceased to fear God. Thus, whilst Joshua was alive, and the other holy Judges, they seemed to be faithful in the exercise of piety, but when <em>they </em>were dead, they straightway relapsed into disobedience. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(324)</span> It will be seen that <em>C</em>. does not give the actual words, but the sense of Stephen. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(325)</span> “Mais qui pis est;” but what is worse. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(326)</span> “Why is his chariot so long in coming?” — <em>A</em>. <em>V</em>. </p></div></div>
