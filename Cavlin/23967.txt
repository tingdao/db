<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_24:9</span><strong>.</strong><em>Then will they deliver you up to be afflicted. </em>Christ now foretells to the disciples another kind of temptation, by which, in addition to ordinary afflictions, their faith must be tried; and that is, that they <em>will be hated </em>and detested <em>by the whole world. </em>It is painful and distressing enough in itself that the children of God should be <em>afflicted </em>in such a manner as not to be distinguished from the reprobate and the despisers of God, and should be subjected to the same punishments which those men endure on account of their crimes; and it appears to be still more unjust that they should be severely oppressed by grievous calamities from which the ungodly are exempted. But as wheat, after having been beaten by the flail along with the chaff, is pressed down and bruised by the millstone, so God not only <em>afflicts </em>his children in common with the ungodly, but subdues them by the cross even beyond others, so that we might be apt to think them more unhappy than the rest of mankind. </p><p>But Christ treats here strictly of the <em>afflictions </em>which the disciples had to endure on account of the gospel. For, though what Paul stays is true, that those whom God hath elected are likewise appointed by him to bear the cross, </p><p>that they may be conformed to the image of his Son, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_8:29</span>,) </p><p>yet he does not distinguish all by this special Mark of enduring persecution from the enemies of the gospel. It is of this species of the cross that Christ now speaks, when it becomes necessary that believers should incur the hatred, meet the reproaches, and provoke the fury, of the ungodly for the testimony of the gospel. For he intended to warn his disciples that the doctrine of the gospel, of which they were to be witnesses and messengers, would never be pleasant or agreeable to the world, as he had formerly explained to them. He foretells not only that they will have to contend with a few enemies, but that, wherever they come, all nations will oppose them. </p><p>But it was monstrous and incredible, and was fitted to astonish and shake even the strongest minds, that the name of the Son of God should be so infamous and hateful, that all who professed it would be everywhere disliked. Accordingly, the words of Mark are, <em>take heed to yourselves. </em>By this expression he points out the end and use of the warning, which is, that they ought to be prepared for endurance, lest, through want of caution, they might be overwhelmed by temptation. The same Mark adds, that <em>this will be for a testimony to kings and rulers, </em>when the disciples of Christ shall be brought before their tribunal. Luke expresses it a little differently, <em>this will happen to you for a testimony, </em>but the sense is quite the same; for Christ means that his gospel will be so much the more fully attested, when they have defended it at the risk of their lives. </p><p>If the apostles had only given their attention to preaching the gospel, and had not stood so firmly in defending it against the furious attacks of enemies, the confirmation of it would not have been so complete. But when they did not hesitate to expose their lives, and were not driven from their purpose by any terrors of death, their unshaken constancy made it manifest, how firmly they were convinced of the goodness of their cause. It was therefore an authentic seal of the gospel, when the apostles advanced without terror to the tribunals of kings, and there made an open profession of the name of Christ. Accordingly, Peter calls himself </p><p>a witness of the sufferings of Christ, (<span class="bvs">1Pe_5:1</span>,) </p><p>whose badges he wore; and Paul boasts that he was </p><p>placed for the defense of the gospel, (<span class="bvs">Phi_1:17</span>.) </p><p>This is eminently worthy of attention, that those on whom God bestows so great an honor as to make them defenders of his truth, may not through base treachery fall from the faith. </p></div>
