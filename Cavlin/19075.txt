<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet had already threatened the Jews with the vengeance of God, and had said that the ministers and executioners of it would be the Chaldeans: he now continues the same subject, and says that their <em>quiver </em>would be like an <em>open sepulcher </em>The nations of the East, we know, made much use of arrows and darts, for they had no pitched battles; but they pretended a flight, and then suddenly turning, they hurled their darts and arrows against their enemies. The Prophet then had a regard to this mode of fighting, when he says that their quivers would be like open sepulchres. It may seem at first sight an unnatural comparison; but it is the same as though he had said, that they would be so skillful in throwing arrows as to destroy all who met them. <span class="cite-ref">(145)</span></p><p>And he adds, that they would be all <em>strong, </em>that the people might know that it would not be a slight conflict: in short, it is the same as though he had said, that this war would be a certain ruin to the Jews, in which they should all perish. He afterwards adds — </p><p><strong>(145)</strong> The idea intended is capaciousness. The grave is represented as never satisfied, ready to receive any number. See <span class="bvs">Pro_27:20</span>. The Chaldean quiver would be so large as to contain a vast quantity of arrows, as though it was an open grave. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
