<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>He hath said in his heart. </em>The Psalmist again points out the source from which the presumption of the ungodly proceeds. Because God seems to take no notice of their wicked practices, they flatter themselves with the hope of escaping unpunished. As, however, they do not openly utter with their mouth the detestable blasphemy, that <em>God hath forgotten their conduct, and hath shut his eyes that he may never see it, </em>but hide their thoughts in the deep recesses of their own hearts, as Isaiah declares, (<span class="bvs">Isa_29:15</span>) the Psalmist uses the same form of expression which he used before, and which he repeats a little after the third time, namely, that the ungodly say to themselves, in their hearts, that God takes no concern whatever in the affairs of men. And it is to be observed, that the ungodly, when all things happen to them according to their wishes, form such a judgment of their prosperity as to persuade themselves that God is in a manner bound or obliged to them. <span class="cite-ref">(224)</span> Whence it comes to pass, that they live in a state of constant security, <span class="cite-ref">(225)</span> because they do not reflect, that after God has long exercised patience towards them, they will undergo a solemn reckoning, and that their condemnation will be the more terrible, the greater the long-suffering of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(224)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Or il faut noter que les meschans voyans que tout leur vient ‘X souchair sont tellement estat de leur prosperite, qu’ils se sont a croire que Dieu est aucunement obligd a eux</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(225)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’ils vivent sans crainte ne souci de l’advenir</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “That they live without any fear or concern about the future.” </p></div></div>
