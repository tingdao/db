<div class="comment-content"><p>After Moses had treated of the offerings and other sacrifices, which were testimonies of gratitude and exercises of piety, he now descends to the sin-offering (<em>expiationem </em>) which held the chief place amongst the sacrifices, inasmuch as, without reconciliation, there could never be any intercourse between men and God; for since He deservedly abominates the whole human race on account of the corruption of our nature, and because we all continually provoke His wrath, the whole hope of salvation must needs be founded on the remedies provided for propitiating Him. This principle, being established, we must remember that Moses will henceforth speak of the expiatory sacrifices which propitiate God to men by the removal of their guilt. He here shews how God is to be appeased, where a man shall have sinned through ignorance or inconsiderateness; wherein too a distinction is laid down between different persons, since one kind of victim is required of a king, another of the priests, and another of ordinary persons; whilst regard is had to the poor, that they may not be burdened by so great an expense as the rich. But, since it will appear from the context that all kinds of ignorance are not here included, we must see what the word <span class="lang he-il">שגגה</span>, <em>shegagah, </em><span class="cite-ref">(256)</span> means, which I have preferred rendering error rather than ignorance; for Moses does not refer to those transgressions into which we are ensnared, when we are led astray by the appearance of rectitude, so as to think ourselves without blame; but to those of which we take no heed, and whereby our minds are not pricked; or to those sudden falls, wherein the infirmity of the flesh so stifles the reason and the judgment as to blind the sinner. It is of such that Paul speaks when he bids us </p><p>"restore in the spirit of meekness those who <LineBreak />are overtaken in a fault,” (<span class="bvs">Gal_6:1</span>;) </p><p>for he does not mean those who are deceived by their good intentions (as they call it,) or rather by their foolish opinion, so as to be unconscious of their sin; but those who fall through the infirmity of their flesh, and whom Satan catches unawares in his snares; or who, at any rate, do not perceive the evil they have done, so as immediately to apply the remedy. This will be more clearly understood from <span class="bvs">Psa_19:12</span>, where David, having asked pardon for his errors, seeks to be kept free from presumptuous sins. <span class="cite-ref">(257)</span> The antithesis between <span class="lang he-il">שגיאות</span>, <em>shegioth, </em><span class="cite-ref">(258)</span> and <span class="lang he-il">זדים</span>, <em>zedim, </em>shews that those transgressions are called errors, in which there is no criminal pride against God. “If a soul shall sin —<em>from all </em>the commandments,” <span class="cite-ref">(259)</span> is a harsh expression; and therefore some refer it to sins of omission, but I interpret it more simply, “If he sin by turning away from the commandments,” or “if he commit any thing opposed (<em>alienum</em>)<em>to </em>the commandments." </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(256)</span><em>S.M. </em>says the word means, “a sin into which the perplexed mind has been driven under the impulse of some passion, through thoughtlessness, imprudence, or error, when inattentive to the dictates of reason and of the Spirit.” — <em>W</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(257)</span> “A superbiis.” —<em>Lat. “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">De ses fiertes, et rebellions</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(258)</span> Lexicographers make no distinction between the approximate roots <span class="lang he-il">שגג</span> and <span class="lang he-il">שגה</span>. Hence <span class="lang he-il">שגיאות</span>, is regarded as meaning the same as the word used in <span class="bvs">Lev_4:2</span>. By <span class="lang he-il">זדים</span>, are understood sins committed with a high hand and rebellious spirit. — <em>W. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(259)</span><em>A. V., </em>“against any of the commandments.” Ainsworth’s version is, “A soule, when it shall sin through ignorance of all the commandments,” etc.; and his Gloss. “<em>of all, </em>understand, <em>by doing any one of all the commandments. </em>So Moses himself explaineth it in the words here following, and in <span class="bvs">Lev_4:13</span>." </p></div></div>
