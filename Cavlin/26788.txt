<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Judas, therefore, having received a band of soldiers. </em>That <em>Judas </em>came accompanied by soldiers and by so large a retinue, is a sign of a bad conscience, which always trembles without any cause. It is certain that the <em>band of soldiers </em>was borrowed from the governor, who also sent a captain at the head of a thousand soldiers; for, on account of sudden mutinies, a garrison was stationed in the city, and the governor himself kept a body-guard, wherever he was. The rest were <em>officers </em>sent by <em>the priests; </em>but John makes separate mention <em>of the Pharisee, </em>because they were more enraged than all the rest, as if they had cared more about religion. </p></div>
