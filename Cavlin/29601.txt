<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Now God himself</em>. He now prays that the Lord, having removed Satan’s obstructions, may open a door for himself, and be, as it were, the leader and director of his way to the Thessalonians. By this he intimates, that we cannot move a step with success, <span class="cite-ref">(562)</span> otherwise than under God’s guidance, but that when he holds out his hand, it is to no purpose that Satan employs every effort to change the direction of our course. We must take notice that he assigns the same office to God and to Christ, as, unquestionably, the Father confers no blessing upon us except through Christ’s hand. When, however, he thus speaks of both in the same terms, he teaches that Christ has divinity and power in common with the Father. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(562)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nous ne pouuons d’vn costé ne d’autre faire vn pas qui proufite et viene a bien</span>;” — “We cannot on one side or another take a step that may be profitable or prosperous.” </p></div></div>
