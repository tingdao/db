<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>We all roar like bears. </em>He describes two classes of those who cannot silently endure their afflictions without making them known by external signs; for some howl fiercely, and others <em>moan like doves</em>. This latter metaphor was employed by him in describing the groans of Hezekiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_38:14</span>;) and this happens when we endeavor to restrain our grief, and yet cannot prevent the outward signs of grief from breaking out in spite of us. The meaning is, that sometimes the violence of their grief constrained them to utter loud cries, and sometimes they complained in low and murmuring sounds, but in both cases without avail, because their condition was not changed for the better. </p><p><em>We looked for judgment. </em>He again repeats that in vain they “looked for judgment and salvation,” meaning that the people were deprived of the assistance of God, which he desired above all things; and he makes use of the word <em>salvation, </em>in order to describe more fully and completely what he formerly denoted by the word “justice,” and now again by the word “judgment.” Thence infer that it is by our own fault that we are wretched, and grow old and waste away in our wretchedness, till we are converted to God. We may indeed moan and howl, but can obtain no alleviation of our grief without repentance. There can be no end of our afflictions, so long as we provoke the Lord’s wrath, and do not desire with the whole heart to be reconciled to him. </p></div>
