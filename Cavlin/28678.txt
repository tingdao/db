<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>But now remaineth faith, hope, love. </em>This is a conclusion from what goes before — that love is more excellent than other gifts; but in place of the enumeration of gifts that he had previously made, he now puts<em>faith </em>and <em>hope </em>along with <em>love, </em>as all those gifts are comprehended under this summary. For what is the object of the entire ministry, but that we may be instructed as to these things? <span class="cite-ref">(805)</span> Hence the term <em>faith </em>has a larger acceptation here, than in previous instances; for it is as though he had said — “There are, it is true, many and various gifts, but they all point to this object, and have an eye to it.” </p><p>To <em>remain, </em>then, conveys the idea, that, as in the reckoning up of an account, when everything has been deducted, this is the sum that <em>remains </em>For faith does not <em>remain </em>after death, inasmuch as the Apostle elsewhere contrasts it with <em>sight, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_5:7</span>,) and declares that it remains only so long as we are <em>absent from the Lord </em>We are now in possession of what is meant by<em>faith </em>in this passage — that knowledge of God and of the divine will, which we obtain by the ministry of the Church; or, if you prefer it, faith universal, and taken in its proper acceptation. <em>Hope </em>is nothing else than perseverance in <em>faith </em>For when we have once believed the word of God, it remains that we persevere until the accomplishment of these things. Hence, as <em>faith </em>is the mother of <em>hope, </em>so it is kept up by it, so as not to give way. </p><p><em>The greatest of these is love. </em>It is so, if we estimate its excellence by the effects which he has previously enumerated; and farther, if we take into view its perpetuity. For every one derives advantage from his own <em>faith </em>and <em>hope, </em>but <em>love </em>extends its benefits to others. <em>Faith </em>and <em>hope </em>belong to a state of imperfection: <em>love </em>will remain even in a state of perfection. For if we single out the particular effects <em>of faith, </em>and compare them, <em>faith </em>will be found to be in many respects superior. Nay, even <em>love </em>itself, according to the testimony of the same Apostle, (<span class="bvs">1Th_1:3</span>,) is an effect of <em>faith </em>Now the effect is, undoubtedly, inferior to its cause. </p><p>Besides, there is bestowed upon <em>faith </em>a signal commendation, which does not apply to <em>love, </em>when John declares that it is <em>our victory, which overcometh the world. </em>(<span class="bvs">1Jo_5:4</span>.) In fine, it is by faith that we are born against that we become the sons of God — that we obtain eternal life, and that <em>Christ dwells in </em>us. (<span class="bvs">Eph_3:17</span>.) Innumerable other things I pass over; but these few are sufficient to prove what I have in view — that faith is, in many of its effects, superior to love. Hence it is evident, that it is declared here to be superior — not in every respect, but inasmuch as it will be perpetual, and holds at present the first place in the preservation of the Church. </p><p>It is, however, surprising how much pleasure Papists take in thundering forth these words. <em>“If faith </em>justifies,” say they, <em>“then </em>much more does <em>love, </em>which is declared to be <em>greater.” </em>A solution of this objection is already furnished from what I have stated, but let us grant that <em>love </em>is in every respect superior; what sort of reasoning is that — that because it is greater, therefore it is of more avail for justifying men! Then a king will plow the ground better than a husbandman, and he will make a shoe better than a shoemaker, because he is more noble than either! Then a man will run faster than a horse, and will carry a heavier burden than an elephant, because he is superior in dignity! Then angels will give light to the earth better than the sun and moon, because they are more excellent! If the power of justifying depended on the dignity or merit of faith they might perhaps be listened to; but we do not teach that faith justifies, on the ground of its having more worthiness, or occupying a higher station of honor, but because it receives the righteousness which is freely offered in the gospel. Greatness or dignity has nothing to do with this. Hence this passage gives Papists no more help, than if the Apostle had given the preference to <em>faith </em>above everything else. </p><p><strong>(805)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En ces trois choses</span>;” — “In these three things.” </p></div>
