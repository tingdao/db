The earnestness of the people in the prosecution of their error is again set forth; for there is no doubt but that it was at their demand that Aaron proclaimed the solemn sacrifice; and now it is not only added that they were ready for it in time, but their extraordinary diligence is declared in that they appeared at the very dawn of day. Now, if, at the instigation of the devil, unbelievers are thus driven headlong to their destruction, alas for our inertness, if at least an equal alacrity does not manifest itself in our zeal! Thus it is said in the Psalm, (<span class="bvs">Psa_110:3</span>,) </p><p>“Thy <span class="cite-ref">(333)</span> people (shall come) with voluntary offerings in the day<LineBreak />(of the assembling) of thy army.” </p><p>What follows as to the people sitting down “to eat and to drink,” many <span class="cite-ref">(334)</span> ignorantly wrest to mean intemperance; as also they wrongly expound their “rising up to play,” as meaning lasciviousness; whereas thus Moses rather designates the sacred banquet and sports engaged in, in honor of the idols; for, as we have seen elsewhere, the faithful feasted before God at their sacrifices, and so also heathen nations celebrated sacred feasts, whilst they worshipped their idols in games. Of this point Paul is the surest interpreter, who quotes this passage in condemnation of the idolatry of the ancient people, and ably accommodates it to the purpose he had in hand; for the Corinthians had not gone to such an excess as to bow their knees to idols, but were boon-companions of unbelievers in their polluted sacrifices.

The latter notion, with respect to the word <em>play</em>, seems to be a very common one with the Commentators. Bushe says it implies “not only such sports as singing, dancing, and merry-making in general, but in some cases also a species of conduct which the epithet <em>wanton </em>as correctly defines as any term which we deem it proper to employ. Compare the use of the same original word rendered <em>mock</em>, <span class="bvs">Gen_39:14</span>. Compare also <span class="bvs">Num_25:1</span>.” Corn. A Lapide quotes a striking parallel as to the abuse of sacrifices among the heathen, from Epicharmus, <em>ap Athenoeum</em>, lib. 2, — “Ex sacrificio epulum, ex epulo facta est potatio, ex potatione comus, ex como ludus, ex ludo judicium, ex judicio condemnatio, ex condemnatione compedes, sphacelus, et mulctatio;” and adds, that “drunken-bouts were called <span class="lang el-gr">μέθας</span>, because they were indulged in <span class="lang el-gr">μετὰ τὸ θύειν</span>, <em>i e</em>. , after sacrifices.” Dathe appears precisely to represent <em>C</em>. ’ <em>s </em>view: “Postridie igitur mane holocausta et eucharistica sacrificant, atque commessationibus et compotationibus peractis, ad saltationes solennes sese convertunt.” </p></div></div>
