<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>O God! hold not thy peace. </em>It is very generally agreed among commentators, that this psalm was composed during the reign of king Jehoshaphat; and in this opinion I readily concur. That godly king, as is well known, had to engage in dreadful wars against multiplied hosts of enemies. Although the Ammonites and Moabites were the originators of the principal war in which he was engaged, yet they mustered forces not only from Syria, but also from distant countries, and the troops thus brought together well nigh overwhelmed Judea with their multitude. It would then appear, from the long list of enemies, here enumerated, who had conspired together to destroy the people of God, that the conjecture is well-founded which refers the composition of this psalm to that occasion; <span class="cite-ref">(430)</span> and sacred history informs us, that one of the Levites, under the influence of the Spirit of prophecy, gave the king assurance of victory, <span class="cite-ref">(431)</span> and that the Levites sang before the Lord. In the midst of so great dangers, the whole nation, as well as the holy king, must have been involved in the deepest distress; and, accordingly, we have here a prayer full of earnestness and solicitude. These feelings prompted the repetition of the words which occur in the very opening of the psalm, <em>Hold not thy peace, Keep not silence, be not still </em>By this, the faithful would intimate, that if God intended to succor them, it behoved him to make haste, else the opportunity for doing so would be lost. It is unquestionably our duty to wait patiently when God at any time delays his help; but, in condescension to our infirmity, he permits us to supplicate him to make haste. What I have rendered, <em>keep not silence with thyself, </em>is literally <em>keep not silence to thyself, </em>which some translate by the paraphrase, <em>Hold not thy peace in thy own cause, </em>â€” an exposition which is too refined to be more particularly noticed. This form of expression is equivalent to saying, <em>Hold not thyself in. </em>Perhaps the particle is here superfluous, as it is in many other places. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(430)</span> Compare the 6<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, 7<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, and 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verses of the psalm with <span class="bvs">2Ch_20:1</span>; and the 12th verse of the psalm with <span class="bvs">2Ch_11:0</span> verse of that chapter. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(431)</span> The name of this Levite was Jahaziel, and he is expressly said to be a prophet of the race of Asaph, <span class="bvs">2Ch_20:14</span>.
