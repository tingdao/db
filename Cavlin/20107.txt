<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet now addresses the Chaldeans, who were to be the executioners of God’s vengeance: hence he says, <em>Make him drunk, because he has magnified himself against Jehovah</em>, that is, raised himself in his pride against God. Then the Prophet, as God’s herald, encouraged the Chaldeans, fully to execute God’s judgment, who had been chosen to be his servants. And the address had more force in it when the Prophet showed that such a command was committed to him, as we have seen elsewhere; for the Prophets showed how efficacious was their doctrine, when they besieged and stormed cities, when they gave orders to armies. This then is the course which Jeremiah now follows, when as God’s herald he summons the Chaldeans, and commands them vigorously to perform what God approved and what he had decreed, even to <em>inebriate </em>the Moabites with evils. The rest to-morrow. </p></div>
