<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>They also that sought for my life have laid snares for me, etc</em>. . Here another circumstance is added, that the enemies of David laid snares for him, and talked about his destruction, and framed deceits among themselves. <span class="cite-ref">(54)</span> The purport of what is stated is, that while his friends cowardly sit still and will do nothing to aid him, his enemies vigorously bestir themselves, and seek by every means to destroy him. He says that <em>they seek his life, </em>for as they were his deadly enemies and blood-thirsty men, they were not content with doing him some common injury, but furiously sought his destruction. He, however, here complains not so much that they assailed him by force of arms and with violence, as he accuses them of guileful conspiracy, which he designates in the first place metaphorically by the term <em>snares, </em>and afterwards adds in plain terms, that they <em>talk about his destruction, </em>and secretly consult among themselves how they might do him hurt. Now, as it is certain that David borrows not an artificial rhetoric from the bar, (as profane orators <span class="cite-ref">(55)</span> do when they plead their cause,) in order to win the favor of God, but rather draws his arguments from the Word of God, the sentences which he here brings together for the confirmation of his faith we ought to appropriate to our own use. If we are altogether destitute of human aid and assistance, if our friends fail us in the time of need, and if others seek our ruin, and breathe out nothing but destruction against us, let us remember that it is not in vain for us to lay these things in prayer before God, whose province it is to succor those who are in misery, to take under his protection those who are perfidiously forsaken and betrayed, to restrain the wicked, and not only to withstand their violence, but also to anticipate their deceitful counsels and to frustrate their designs. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(54)</span> ”<span class="lang fr-fr">Et machine des finesses pour le surprendre</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “And devised stratagems for ensnaring him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(55)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme celles des orateurs profanes</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
