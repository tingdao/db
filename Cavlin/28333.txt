<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>Now I beseech you, etc. </em>It is well known from many passages how much ill-will prevailed against Paul in his own nation on account of false reports, as though he taught a departure from Moses. He knew how much calumnies might avail to oppress the innocent, especially among those who are carried away by inconsiderate zeal. Added also to this, was the testimony of the Spirit, recorded in <span class="bvs">Act_20:23</span>; by which he was forewarned, that bonds and afflictions awaited him at Jerusalem. The more danger then he perceived, the more he was moved: hence it was, that he was so solicitous to commend his safety to the Churches; nor let us wonder, that he was anxious about his life, in which he knew so much danger to the Church was involved. </p><p>He then shows how grieved his godly mind was, by the earnest protestation he makes, in which he adds to the name of the <em>Lord, the love of the Spirit, </em>by which the saints ought to embrace one another. But though in so great a fear, he yet continued to proceed; nor did he so dread danger, but that he was prepared willingly to meet it. At the same time he had recourse to the remedies given him by God; for he solicited the aid of the Church, so that being helped by its prayers, he might find comfort, according to the Lord’s promise, — </p><p>“Where two or three shall assemble in my name, there in the midst of them am I,” (<span class="bvs">Mat_18:20</span>;) </p><p>and, </p><p>“Whatsoever they agree in on earth, they shall obtain in heaven,” (<span class="bvs">Mat_18:19</span>.) </p><p>And lest no one should think it an unmeaning commendation, he besought them both by Christ and by the love of the Spirit. The love of the Spirit is that by which Christ joins us together; for it is not that of the flesh, nor of the world, but is from his Spirit, who is the bond of our unity. </p><p>Since then it is so great a favor from God to be helped by the prayers of the faithful, that even Paul, a most choice instrument of God, did not think it right to neglect this privilege, how great must be our stupidity, if we, who are abject and worthless creatures, disregard it? But to take a handle from such passages for the purpose of maintaining the intercessions of dead saints, is an instance of extreme effrontery. <span class="cite-ref">(465)</span></p><p><em>That ye strive together with me, </em><span class="cite-ref">(466)</span><em>etc. </em>[<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>] has not given an unsuitable rendering, “That ye help me laboring:” but, as the Greek word, used by Paul, has more force, I have preferred to give a literal rendering: for by the word <em>strive, </em>or contend, he alludes to the difficulties by which he was oppressed, and by bidding them to assist in this contest, he shows how the godly ought to pray for their brethren, that they are to assume their person, as though they were placed in the same difficulties; and he also intimates the effect which they have; for he who commends his brother to the Lord, by taking to himself a part of his distress, do so far relieve him. And indeed if our strength is derived from prayer to God, we can in no better way confirm our brethren, than by praying to God for them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(465)</span> [<span class="bvs">Scott </span>] quotes the following from [<span class="bvs">Whitby </span>], — “If Paul, saith [<span class="bvs">Estius </span>], might desire the prayers of the Romans, why might not the Romans desire the prayers of Paul? I answer, they might desire his prayers, <em>as </em>he did theirs, by a letter directed to him to pray for them. He adds, If they might desire his prayers for them when living, why not when dead and reigning with Christ? I answer, Because they could direct no epistle to him, or in any other way acquaint him with their mind.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(466)</span> “Ut concertetis mihi<span class="lang el-gr">,” συναγωνίσασθαί μοι; </span> “ut mecum certetis — that ye strive with me,” — [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>]; “ut mecum laboretis — that ye labor with me,” — <em>Tremelius</em>, from the Syriac. Literally it is, “that ye agonize with me.” It is an allusion, says [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>], to Jacob’s wrestling with the angel. <span class="bvs">Gen_32:24</span>. A strenuous and earnest supplication is intended. [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] says, that it is a metaphor taken from warfare, when a soldier comes to the help of another: but rather from the games, when there is a striving for the prize. He would have the Romans to make a similar strenuous effort for him in prayer to God. The word<span class="lang el-gr">ἀγὼν, </span> is an agonistic and not a military term. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
