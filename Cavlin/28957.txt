<div class="comment-content"><p>This statement may seem at first view to suit ill, or not sufficiently well, with what goes before; for he seems to speak of a new matter, that he had not previously touched upon, while in reality he is following out the same subject. Let the <em>reader, </em>however, observe, that Paul treats of the very same matter that he had been treating of before — that it was from no want of confidence that he exhorted the Corinthians, and that his admonition is not coupled with any reproof as to the past, but that he has particular reasons that influence him. The meaning, then, of what he says now is this: “I do not teach you that it is a duty to afford relief to the saints, for what need were there of this? For that is sufficiently well known to you, and you have given practical evidence that you are not prepared to be wanting to them; <span class="cite-ref">(704)</span> but as I have, from boasting everywhere of your liberality, pledged my credit along with yours, this consideration will not allow me to refrain from speaking.” But for this, such anxious concern might have been somewhat offensive to the Corinthians, because they would have thought, either that they were reproached for their indolence, or that they were suspected by Paul. By bringing forward, however, a most, suitable apology, he secures for himself the liberty of not merely exhorting them, without giving offense, but even from time to time urging them. </p><p>Some one, however, may possibly suspect, that Paul here pretends what he does not really think. This were exceedingly absurd; for if he reckons them to be sufficiently prepared for doing their duty, why does he set himself so vigorously to admonish them? and, on the other hand, if he is in doubt as to their willingness, why does he declare it to be unnecessary to admonish them? Love carries with it these two things, — good hope, and anxious concern. Never would he have borne such a testimony in favor of the Corinthians, had he not been fully of the mind that he expresses. He had seen a happy commencement: he had hoped, that the farther progress of the matter would be corresponding; but as he was well aware of the unsteadiness of the human mind, he could not provide too carefully against their turning aside from their pious design. </p><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Ministering. </em>This term seems not very applicable to those that give of their substance to the poor, inasmuch as liberality is deserving of a more splendid designation. <span class="cite-ref">(705)</span> Paul, however, had in view, what believers owe to their fellowmembers. <span class="cite-ref">(706)</span> For the members of Christ ought mutually to minister to each other. In this way, when we relieve the brethren, we do nothing more than discharge a ministry that is due to them. On the other hand, to neglect the saints, when they stand in need of our aid, is worse than inhuman, inasmuch as we defraud them of what is their due. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(704)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ou vous espargner en leur endroit</span>;” — “Or to spare yourselves as to what you owe them.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(705)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vn titre plus magnifique et honorable</span>;” — “A more magnificent and honorable designation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(706)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceux qui sont membres d’vn mesme corps auec eux</span>;” — “Those that are members of the same body with themselves.” </p></div></div>
