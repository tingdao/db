<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And there were shepherds </em>It would have been to no purpose that Christ was born in Bethlehem, if it had not been made known to the world. But the method of doing so, which is described by Luke, appears to the view of men very unsuitable. First, Christ is revealed but to a few witnesses, and that too amidst the darkness of night. Again, though God had, at his command, many honorable and distinguished witnesses, he passed by them, and chose shepherds, persons of humble rank, and of no account among men. Here the reason and wisdom of the flesh must prove to be foolishness; and we must acknowledge, that “the foolishness of God” (<span class="bvs">1Co_1:25</span>) excels all the wisdom that exists, or appears to exist, in the world. But this too was a part of the “emptying of himself,” (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:6</span> :) not that any part of Christ’s glory should be taken away by it, but that it should lie in concealment for a time. Again, as Paul reminds us, that the gospel is mean according to the flesh, “that our faith should stand” in the power of the Spirit, not in the “lofty <span class="cite-ref">(142)</span> words of human wisdom,” or in any worldly splendor, <span class="cite-ref">(143)</span> (<span class="bvs">1Co_2:4</span>;) so this inestimable “treasure” has been deposited by God, from the beginning, “in earthen vessels,” (<span class="bvs">2Co_4:7</span>,) that he might more fully try the obedience of our faith. If then we desire to come to Christ, let us not be ashamed to follow those whom the Lord, in order to cast down the pride of the world, has taken, from among the dung <span class="cite-ref">(144)</span> of cattle, to be our instructors. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(142)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En paroles magnifiques</span>;” — “in magnificent words.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(143)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En quelque lustre et apparence du monde</span>;” — “in any luster and display of the world.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(144)</span> “Ex pecudum stercore;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">sur la fiente des bestes</span>.” </p></div></div>
