<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>I would rather speak five words. </em>This is spoken <em>hyperbolically, </em>unless you understand <em>five words, </em>as meaning <em>five sentences. </em>Now as Paul, who might otherwise have exulted loftily in his power of speaking with tongues, voluntarily abstains from it, and, without any show, aims at <em>edification </em>exclusively, he reproves, by this means, the empty ambition of those, that are eagerly desirous to show themselves off with empty <em>tinkling. </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_13:1</span>.) The authority of the Apostle ought, also, to have no little weight in drawing them off from vanity of this kind. </p></div>
