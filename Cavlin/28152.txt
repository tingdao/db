<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>As it is written</em>, <em>etc. </em>This testimony adds no small weight to the subject; for he intimates, that the dread of death is so far from being a reason to us for falling away, that it has been almost ever the lot of Godâ€™s servants to have death as it were present before their eyes. It is indeed probable, that in that Psalm the miserable oppression of the people under the tyranny of Antiochus is described; for it is expressly said, that the worshippers of God were cruelly treated, for no other reason but through hatred to true religion. There is also added a remarkable protestation, that they had not departed from the covenant of God; which Paul, I think, had especially in view. It is no objection that the saints there complain of a calamity which then unusually pressed on them; for since they show, that they were oppressed with so many evils, having before testified their innocence, an argument is hence fitly drawn, that it is no new thing for the Lord to permit his saints to be undeservedly exposed to the cruelty of the ungodly. But this is not done except for their good; for the Scripture teaches us, that it is alien to the righteousness of God to destroy the just with the wicked, (<span class="bvs">Gen_18:23</span>); but that, on the contrary, it is meet for him to requite affliction to those who afflict, and rest to those who are afflicted. (<span class="bvs">2Th_1:6</span>.) And then they affirm that they suffer for the Lord; and Christ pronounces them blessed who suffer for the sake of righteousness. (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:10</span>.) By saying that they <em>died daily</em>, they intimated that death was so suspended over them, that their life differed but little from death. </p></div>
