<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>The day is thine, the night also is thine. </em>The prophet now descends to the consideration of the divine benefits which are extended in common to all mankind. Having commenced with the special blessings by which God manifested himself to be the Father of his chosen people, he now aptly declares that God exercises his beneficence towards the whole human family. He teaches us, that it is not by chance that the days and nights succeed each other in regular succession, but that this order was established by the appointment of God. The secondary cause of these phenomena is added, being that arrangement by which God has invested the sun with the power and office of illuminating the earth; for after having spoken of <em>the light </em>he adds <em>the sun, </em>as the principal means of communicating it, and, so to speak, the chariot in which it is brought when it comes to show itself to men. <span class="cite-ref">(240)</span> As then the incomparable goodness of God towards the human race clearly shines forth in this beautiful arrangement, the prophet justly derives from it an argument for strengthening and establishing his trust in God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(240)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme le principal instrument d’icelle, et par maniere de dire, le chariot auquel elle est apportee, quand elle se vient monstrer aux hommes</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
