Those who truly loved Christ reckoned that it would be a disgrace to them if they did not associate themselves with Paul as his companions, when maintaining the cause of the gospel; and we must act in such a manner, as to give a helping hand, as far as possible, to the servants of Christ when in difficulty. <span class="cite-ref">(74)</span> Observe, again, this expression — <em>for the defense of the gospel </em>For since Christ confers upon us so great an honor, what excuse shall we have, if we shall be traitors to his cause, <span class="cite-ref">(75)</span> or what may we expect, if we betray it by our silence, but that <em>he </em>shall in return desert our cause, who is our sole <em>Advocate</em>, or Patron, <em>with the Father? </em><span class="cite-ref">(76)</span> (<span class="bvs">1Jo_2:1</span>.) </p><p><strong>(74)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estans en quelque necessite</span>;” — “When they are in any emergency.” </p><p><strong>(75)</strong> “<em>Praevaricatores </em> ” The term is employed by classical writers in the sense of betraying the cause of one’s client, and by neglect or collusion assisting his opponent. See Quinct. 9:2. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(76)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si nous nous entendons auec la partie aduerse d’iceluy</span>;” — “If we should connect ourselves with the party opposed to him.” </p></div>
