<div class="comment-content"><p>In the last verse, the pious Jews declare that the fruit of their deliverance will be, that <em>the name of God will be celebrated; </em>and we ought not to desire our preservation or welfare for any other end. When he freely bestows upon us all things, the design for which he does this is, that his goodness may be made known and exalted. Now, these sufferers engage to make a grateful acknowledgement of their deliverance, and declare that this will not be done merely for a short time, but that the remembrance of it will be transmitted to their posterity, and pass, in continued succession, from age to age to the end of the world. The particular designation here given to them is also worthy of notice: <em>We are thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture </em>As the posterity of Abraham were chosen to celebrate the name of God, and that his praises might resound in Zion, what would have been the consequence had that people been destroyed, but that the memory of the name of God would have perished? This passage, there is no doubt, corresponds with that prophecy of Isaiah, </p><p>“This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_43:21</span>) </p></div>
