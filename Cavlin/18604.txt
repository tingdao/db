<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Our Redeemer. </em>The Prophet shews for what purpose the Lord will inflict punishment on the Babylonians; that is, for the salvation of his people, as he had formerly declared. (<span class="bvs">Isa_45:4</span>.) But this statement is much more forcible, because he speaks in what may be called an abrupt manner, and like a person awakened out of sleep, when he sees Babylon ruined, which formerly was wont to subdue other nations and trample them under her feet; and he shews that this happens for no other reason than that the Lord shews himself to be the “Redeemer” and defender of his people. </p><p><em>The Holy One of Israel. </em>As if he had said, that not in vain hath he chosen this people, and separated it from other nations. In this transaction he intended to give a display of his power, and. on that account added to the title descriptive of his power, <em>Jehovah of Hosts, </em>the designation “Holy.” </p></div>
