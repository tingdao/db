<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord</em>. Cain is said to have departed from the presence of God, because, whereas he had hitherto lived in the earth as in an abode belonging to God, now, like an exile removed far from God’s sight, he wanders beyond the limits of His protection. Or certainly, (which is not less probable,) Moses represents him as having stood at the bar of judgment till he was condemned: but now, when God ceased to speak with him, being freed from the sense of His presence, he hastens elsewhere and seeks a new habitation, where he may escape the eyes of God. The land of Nod <span class="cite-ref">(249)</span> without doubt obtained its name from its inhabitant. From its being situated on the eastern side of Paradise, we may infer the truth of what was before stated, that a certain place, distinguished by its pleasantness and rich abundance of fruits, had been given to Adam for a habitation; for, of necessity, that place must be limited, which has opposite aspects towards the various regions of the world. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(249)</span> “<span class="lang he-il">נוד</span> signifies motion, flight, wandering, exile, and is the name of the region into which Cain was exiled.” — <em>Schindler </em></p></div></div>
