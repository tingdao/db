<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>That on the Sabbaths the priests profane the Sabbath. </em>This is the <em>second </em>argument by which Christ proves that the violation of the Sabbath, of which the Pharisees complained, was free from all blame; because <em>on the Sabbaths </em>it is lawful to slay beasts for sacrifice, to circumcise infants, and to do other things relating to the worship of God. Hence it follows, that the duties of piety are in no degree inconsistent with each other. <span class="cite-ref">(78)</span> But if <em>the temple </em>sanctifies manual operations connected with sacrifices, and with the whole of the outward service, the holiness of the true and spiritual <em>temple </em>has greater efficacy, in exempting its worshippers from all blame, while they are discharging the duties of godliness. <span class="cite-ref">(79)</span> Now the object which the disciples had in view was, to present to God souls which were consecrated by the Gospel. </p><p>Matthew alone glances at this argument. When Christ says, that <em>the priests Profane the Sabbath, </em>the expression is not strictly accurate, and is accommodated to his hearers; for when the Law enjoins men to abstain from their employments, it does not forbid them to perform the services of religion. But Christ admits that to be true which might appear to be so in the eye of ignorant persons, <span class="cite-ref">(80)</span> and rests satisfied with proving, that the labors performed in the temple are not offensive to God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(78)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que les exercices de piete ne sont point contraires les uns aux autres, mais s’accordent bien ensemble</span>;” — “that the exercises of godliness are not opposed to each other, but agree well together.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(79)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand ils s’employent a oeuvres qui tendent a l’honneur de Dieu</span>;” — “when they are employed in works which tend to the honor of God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(80)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ainsi Christ accorde estre vray, ce qui ne l’est pas de faict, mais qui pourroit sembler l’estre en apparence a gens qui ne scavent pas bien iuger et discerner les choses</span>;” — “thus Christ admits that to be true which is not so in reality, but which might appear to be so to persons who do not know how to judge and distinguish matters properly.” </p></div></div>
