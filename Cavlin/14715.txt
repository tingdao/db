<div class="comment-content"><p>The term <span class="lang he-il">בלע</span><em>, balang, </em>in verse fourth, which has been translated <em>destruction, </em>I prefer understanding in the sense of <em>hiding </em>or <em>concealment. </em>He seems to allude to the drawing back of the tongue when we swallow; and under this figure, to describe the deceitfulness of Doeg’s words, by which he devoured the unsuspecting and the innocent. <span class="cite-ref">(277)</span> The great design of David, as I have already remarked in the preceding verses, is to encourage himself in the hope of deliverance by dwelling upon the extreme character of that wickedness which his enemy had displayed. </p><p><strong>(277)</strong> “<span class="lang he-il">בלע</span>, <em>balang</em>, is <em>to swallow</em>, <em>to devour</em>, with the idea of eagerness, greediness.” — <em>Gesenius </em></p></div>
