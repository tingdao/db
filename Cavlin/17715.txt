<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>In that day shall he swear. </em>The word <em>swear </em>expresses an absolute and vehement refusal; for frequently he who at first excuses himself, or declares that he will not do it, at length yields to entreaty; but he who, in refusing, employs an oath, shuts out all hope, because he gives them to understand that his purpose is firm and decided. Perhaps, too, the phrase <em>in that day</em>, means “<em>immediately</em>, without any delay, and without long consultation;” but as it may also be viewed demonstratively, (<span class="lang el-gr">δεικτικῶς</span>,) as pointing out more fully the time of the calamity, I do not express a strong opinion. The general meaning is obvious, that their ruinous condition will be past remedy. </p><p>As to the word <span class="lang he-il">חבש</span>, (<em>chobesh</em>,) though commentators differ in their interpretation of it, yet I cheerfully concur with those who think that the metaphor is here borrowed from surgeons; <span class="cite-ref">(57)</span> for nothing can more fully meet the case. It is as if one, to whom application had been made to heal a sick man, should declare that he has no skill in the art of healing, or that the disease is too inveterate to admit of being cured. </p><p>The next copulative <span class="lang he-il">ו</span>, (<em>vau</em>,) means for; as if he had said, “And undoubtedly I have not ability to do so.” <span class="cite-ref">(58)</span> His meaning therefore is, that the state of affairs will be so desperate, that no man, even when matters are at the worst, will venture to take measures for their defense. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(57)</span><span class="lang he-il">חבש</span> (<em>chabash</em>) literally signifies <em>to bind I will not be a binder</em>; that is, “I will not be one who binds up your wounds.” Jarchi renders it, “<em>I will not be a binder</em>, that is, I will not be one of those who <em>bind up.” </em>His annotator, Breithaupt, explains it thus: “that is, who employ any remedy, or apply a plaster, teaching in the school or synagogue what should be done, and what should be avoided.” This accords with the rendering, <em>healer</em>, as in the English version, which is supported by that of Lowth, “I will not be a healer of thy breaches.” — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(58)</span><span class="lang he-il">ובביתי</span> (<em>ubebethi</em>,) and <em>in my house</em>; that is, for <em>in my house is neither bread nor clothing</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
