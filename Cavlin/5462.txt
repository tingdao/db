<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her</em>. I have been compelled to separate this sentence from the foregoing context which I have explained elsewhere; <span class="cite-ref">(161)</span> for Moses there gave instructions how a captive woman was to be taken to wife if her beauty attracted a Jewish husband. That law then had reference to chastity and conjugal fidelity, and especially to the purity of Godâ€™s worship; but now Moses prescribes that, if a man have dishonored a captive woman, he should not sell her, but let her go free, and by this satisfaction wipe out, or at any rate diminish, the injury. Hence we infer that this rule of justice depends on the Eighth Commandment, Let none defraud another. This condition was at least tolerable for the captive; for, although chastity is a special treasure, yet liberty, which is justly called an inestimable blessing, was no trifling consolation to her. The penalty, then, of lust, was that the conqueror should lose his booty. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(161)</span><em>Vide </em>vol. 2, p. 70. </p></div></div>
