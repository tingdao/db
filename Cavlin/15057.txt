<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>They have said in their heart, Let us destroy them all together. </em>To express the more forcibly the atrocious cruelty of the enemies of the Church, the prophet introduces them speaking together, and exciting one another to commit devastation without limit or measure. His language implies, that each of them, as if they had not possessed enough of courage to do mischief, stirred up and stimulated his fellow to waste and destroy the whole of God’s people, without leaving so much as one of them. In the close of the verse he asserts that all the synagogues were burned. I readily take the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">מועדים</span>, <em>moadim, </em>in the sense of <em>synagogues, </em><span class="cite-ref">(225)</span> because he says ALL <em>the sanctuaries, </em>and speaks expressly <em>of the whole land. </em>It is a frigid explanation which is given by some, that these enemies, upon finding that they could not hurt or do violence to the sanctuary of God in heaven, turned their rage against the material temple or synagogues. The prophet simply complains that they were so intent upon blotting out the name of God, that they left not a single corner on which there was not the mark of the hand of violence. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">מועדים</span>, <em>moadim, </em>is commonly taken for <em>the sanctuary; </em>but when we consider its etymology, it is not inappropriately applied to those places where the holy assemblies were wont to be held, not only for reading and expounding the prophets, but also for calling upon the name of God. The wicked, as if the prophet had said, have done all in their power to extinguish and annihilate the worship of God in Judea. </p><p><strong>(225)</strong> It has been objected, that if this psalm was composed at the time of the captivity of the Jews by Nebuchadnezzar, and the desolation of the Holy Land by the Chaldeans, <span class="lang he-il">מועדי</span>, <em>moadey</em>, cannot signify <em>synagogues</em>, because the Jews had no synagogues for public worship or public instruction till after the Babylonish captivity. Accordingly, Dr Prideaux thinks that the Proseuchae are meant. These were courts resembling those in which the people prayed at the tabernacle, and afterwards at the temple, built by those who lived at a distance from Jerusalem, and who were unable at all times to resort thither. They were erected as places in which the Jews might offer up their daily prayers. “They differed,” says Prideaux, “from synagogues in several particulars. For, first, In synagogues the prayers were offered up in public forms in common for the whole congregation; but in the Proseuchae they prayed as in the temple, every one apart for himself. Secondly, The synagogues were covered houses; but the Proseuchae were open courts, built in the manner of forums, which were open enclosures. Thirdly, Synagogues were all built within the cities to which they did belong; but the Proseuchae without.” — <em>Connection of the History</em>, etc., Part 1, Book 6, pages 139-141. Synagogues were afterwards used for the same purpose as the Proseuchae, and hence both come to be designated by the same name. The same author supposes that those places in the cities of the Levites, and the schools of the prophets, whither the people resorted for instruction, having been called, as well as the Proseuchae, <span class="lang he-il">מועדי-אל</span>, <em>moadey-el</em>, are also here intended. “The word <span class="lang he-il">מועדי</span>, <em>moadey</em>, ” says Dr Adam Clarke, “which we translate <em>synagogues</em>, may be taken in a more general sense, and mean <em>any places </em>where <em>religious assemblies </em>were held; and that such places and assemblies did exist long <em>before </em>the Babylonish captivity is pretty evident from different parts of Scripture.” See <span class="bvs">2Kg_4:23</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_33:31</span>; <span class="bvs">Act_15:21</span>. All such places were consumed to ashes by the hostile invaders whose ravages are bewailed, it having been their purpose to extinguish for ever the Jewish religion, and, as the most likely means of effecting their object, to destroy every memorial of it. </p></div>
