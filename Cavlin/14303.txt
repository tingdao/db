<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Draw me not away with wicked men. </em>The meaning is, that in circumstances so dissimilar, God should not mingle the righteous with the wicked in the same indiscriminate destruction. <span class="cite-ref">(595)</span> Undoubtedly, too, in speaking of his enemies, he indirectly asserts his own integrity. But he did not pray in this manner, because he thought that God was indiscriminately and unreasonably angry with men; he reasons rather from the nature of God, that he ought to cherish good hope, because it was God’s prerogative to distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, and to give every one his due reward. By <em>the workers of iniquity, </em>he means man wholly addicted to wickedness. The children of God sometimes fall, commit errors, and act amiss in one way or other, but they take no pleasure in their evil doings; the fear of God, on the contrary, stirs them up to repentance. David afterwards defines and enlarges upon the wickedness of those whom he describes; for, under pretense of friendship they perfidiously deceived good men, professing one thing with their tongue, while they entertained a very different thing in their hearts. Open depravity is easier to be borne with than this craftiness of the fox, when persons put on fair appearances in order to find opportunity of doing mischief. <span class="cite-ref">(596)</span> This truth, accordingly, admonishes us that those are most detestable in God’s sight, who attack the simple and unwary with fair speeches as with poison. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(595)</span> The verb <span class="lang he-il">משך</span>, <em>mashak, </em>here rendered <em>draw, </em>“signifies,” as <em>Hammond </em>observes, “both to draw and apprehend,” and may “be best rendered here, <em>Seize not on me, </em>as he that seizeth on any to carry or drag him to execution. The Septuagint, after having literally rendered the Hebrew by <span class="lang el-gr">Μὴ συνελκύσὟς την ψυχήν μου</span>, <em>draw not my soul together with, etc., </em>adds <span class="lang el-gr">Κίαν μὴ συναπολέσὟς με</span> etc., <em>and destroy me not together with, etc. </em>Calvin here evidently takes the same view; though he does not express it in the form of criticism. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(596)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que ceste finesse de renard, quand on use de beaux semblans pour avoir occasion de nuire</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
