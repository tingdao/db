<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Unless a grain of wheat having fallen into the ground, die, it remaineth alone. If a grain of wheat do not die </em>or putrefy, it continues to be dry and unfruitful; but the death of the seed has the beneficial effect of quickening it, that it may yield fruit. In short, Christ compares his death to sowing, which appears to tend to the destruction of the <em>wheat, </em>but yet is the cause of far more abundant increase. Though this admonition was especially necessary at that time, yet it is of continual use in the Church. And, first, we ought to begin with the Head. That dreadful appearance of disgrace and cursing, which appears in the death of Christ, not only obscures his glory, but removes it altogether from our view. We must not, therefore, confine our attention to his death alone, but must likewise consider the fruit which has been yielded by his glorious resurrection. <span class="cite-ref">(21)</span> Thus there will be nothing to prevent his glory from being every where displayed. From him we must next come to the members; for not only do we think that we perish in death, but our life also is a sort of continual death, (<span class="bvs">Col_3:3</span>.) We shall therefore be undone, unless we be supported by that consolation which Paul holds out: </p><p>if our outward man decays, the inward man is renewed <LineBreak />from day to day, (<span class="bvs">2Co_4:16</span>.) </p><p>When, therefore, the godly are distressed by various afflictions, when they are pressed hard by the difficulties of their situation, when they suffer hunger, or nakedness, or disease, when they are assailed by reproaches, when it appears as if they would every hour be almost overwhelmed by death, let them unceasingly consider that this is a sowing which, in due time, will yield fruit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(21)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sa resurrection glorieuse</span>.” </p></div></div>
