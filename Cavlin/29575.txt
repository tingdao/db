<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>For neither have we ever</em>. It is not without good reason that he repeats it so frequently, that the Thessalonians knew that what he states is true. For there is not a surer attestation, than the experience of those with whom we speak. And this was of the greatest importance to them, because Paul relates with what integrity he had conducted himself, with no other intention, than that his doctrine may have the greater respect, for the building up of their faith. It is, however, a confirmation of the foregoing statement, for he that is desirous to <em>please men</em>, must of necessity stoop shamefully to flattery, while he that is intent upon duty with an earnest and upright disposition, will keep at a distance from all appearance of flattery. </p><p>When he adds, <em>nor for an occasion of covetousness</em>, he means that he had not, in teaching among them, been in quest of anything in the way of personal gain. <span class="lang el-gr">Πρόφασις</span> is employed by the Greeks to mean both <em>occasion </em>and <em>pretext</em>, but the former signification suits better with the passage, so as to be, as it were, a trap. <span class="cite-ref">(522)</span> “I have not abused the gospel so as to make it an occasion of catching at gain.” As, however, the malice of men has so many winding retreats, that avarice and ambition frequently lie concealed, he on this account calls God to witness. Now, he makes mention here of two vices, from which he declares himself to be exempt, and, in doing so, teaches that the servants of Christ should stand aloof from them. Thus, if we would distinguish the genuine servants of Christ from those that are pretended and spurious, they must be tried according to this rule, and every one that would serve Christ aright must also conform his aims and his actions to the same rule. For where avarice and ambition reign, innumerable corruptions follow, and the whole man passes away into vanity, for these are the two sources from which the corruption of the whole ministry takes its rise. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(522)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tellement que ce soit vne ruse ou finesse, semblable a celle de ceux qui tendent les filets pour prendre les oiseaux</span>;” — “So that it is a trick or artifice, similar to that of those who set traps for catching birds.” </p></div></div>
