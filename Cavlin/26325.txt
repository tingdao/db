<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>67.</strong><em>Jesus therefore said to the twelve. </em>As the faith of the apostles might be greatly shaken, when they saw that they were so small a remnant of a great multitude, Christ directs his discourse to them, and shows that there is no reason why they should allow themselves to be hurried away by the lightness and unsteadiness of others. When he asks them if <em>they also wish to go away, </em>he does so in order to confirm their faith; for, by exhibiting to them himself, that they may remain with him, he likewise exhorts them not to become the companions of apostates. And, indeed, if faith be founded on Christ, it will not depend on men, and will never waver, though it should see heaven and earth mingling. We ought also to observe this circumstance, that Christ, when deprived of nearly all his disciples, retains <em>the twelve </em>only, in like manner as Isaiah was formerly commanded to </p><p>bind the testimony and seal the law among the disciples, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_8:16</span>.) </p><p>By such examples, every one of the believers is taught to follow God, even though he should have no companion. </p></div>
