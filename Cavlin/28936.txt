<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Beseeching us with much entreaty. </em>He enlarges upon their promptitude, inasmuch as they did not only not wait for any one to admonish them, but even <em>besought </em>those, by whom they would have been admonished, had they not anticipated the desires of all by their activity. <span class="cite-ref">(666)</span> We must again repeat the comparison formerly made between the less and the greater. “If the Macedonians, without needing to be besought, press forward of their own accord, nay more, anticipate others by using entreaties, how shameful a thing is it for the Corinthians to be inactive, more especially after being admonished! If the Macedonians lead the way before all, how shameful a thing is it for the Corinthians not, at least, to imitate their example! But what are we to think, when, not satisfied with <em>beseeching, </em>they added to their requests <em>earnest entreaty, </em>and much of it too?” Now from this it appears, that they had <em>besought, </em>not as a mere form, but in good earnest. </p><p><em>That the favor and the fellowship. </em>The term<em>favor </em>he has made use of, for the purpose of recommending alms, though at the same time the word may be explained in different ways. This interpretation, however, appears to me to be the more simple one; because, as our heavenly Father freely bestows upon us all things, so we ought to be imitators of his unmerited kindness in doing good, (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:45</span>); or at least, because, in laying out our resources, we are simply the dispensers of his <em>favor. </em>The <em>fellowship of this ministry </em>consisted in his being a helper to the Macedonians in this <em>ministry. </em>They contributed of their own, that it might be <em>administered </em>to the saints. They wished, that Paul would take the charge of collecting it. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(666)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le desir et la solicitation de tous par leur diligence et promptitude</span>;” — “The desire and solicitation of all by their diligence and promptitude.” </p></div></div>
