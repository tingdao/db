<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>112.</strong><em>I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes. </em>In this verse he describes the right observance of the law, which consists in Our cheerfully and heartily preparing ourselves for doing what the law commands. Slavish and constrained obedience differs little from rebellion. The prophet, therefore, in order briefly to define what it is to serve God, asserts, that he applied not only his hands, eyes, or feet, to the keeping of the law, but that he began with the affection of the heart. Instead of the verb <em>incline, </em>the verb <em>extend </em>might with propriety be employed; but I am inclined to rest in the more generally received interpretation, which is, that he devoted himself with sincere affection of heart to the observance of the law. This inclination of the heart is oppose to the wandering lusts which rise up against God, and drag us any where rather than incline us to a virtuous life. The attempt of the Papists to defend from this passage their doctrine of free will is mere trifling. They infer from the words of the prophet, that it is in the power of man to bend his own heart in whatever way he pleases. But the answer is easy. The prophet does not here boast of what he had done by his own strength, for he now repeats the very same word which he had employed before, when he said, <em>Incline my heart to these testimonies. </em>If that prayer was not feigned, he doubtless acknowledged by it that it was the peculiar work of the Holy Spirit to incline and frame our hearts to God. But it is no new thing for that to be ascribed to us which God works in us: Paul’s statement to this effect is very plain, </p><p>“It is God who worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasures” (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:13</span>.) </p><p>When the prophet says of himself that <em>he inclined his heart, </em>he does not separate his own endeavor from the grace of the Holy Spirit, by whose inspiration he has previously declared that the whole was done. At the same time, he distinguishes the constancy of his pious affection from the transient favor of others. Thus, that he might not fail in the midst of his course, or even go backward, he affirms that he had resolved to continue in the same course during the whole of his life. The word <span class="lang he-il">עקב</span>, <em>ekeb, to the end, </em>in my opinion, is added to the word <span class="lang he-il">לעולם</span>, <em>leolam, for ever, </em>by way of exposition; and to show us that he struggled manfully against all obstacles and difficulties, that they might not break his constancy; for no man perseveres in the service of God without arduous exertions. Some take the word as denoting <em>a reward; </em><span class="cite-ref">(435)</span> but this seems too foreign to the design of the passage. </p><p><strong>(435)</strong> Thus, in the Arabic, it is, “on account of an eternal reward;” that is, the reward of grace promised to all the faithful. According to this view, the Psalmist would have a respect to the end and reward of faith and holy obedience. See <span class="bvs">Heb_11:26</span>; <span class="bvs">1Pe_1:8</span>. As, however, the Psalmist, like all true believers, did not embrace and obey the law of God, only or chiefly from the hope of reward, but was chiefly attracted to obedience by love to God, and the intrinsic excellence of the law, others prefer reading “the reward <em>is </em>eternal.” </p></div>
