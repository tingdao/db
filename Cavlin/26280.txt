<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Next day. </em>Here the Evangelist relates circumstances from which the multitude might conclude that Christ had gone across by divine power. There had been but one ship; they see it go away without Christ; next day, ships come from other places, by which they are conveyed to Capernaum; and there they find Christ. It follows that he must have been conveyed across in a miraculous manner. There is an intricacy and apparent confusion (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀνακόλουθον</span>) in the words, but still the meaning of them is plain enough; for, in the 22<span class="cite-ref">nd</span> verse, John says that <em>there had been but one ship</em>, and that all saw it leave the shore and that place, and that it had not Christ as a passenger; and, in the 23<span class="cite-ref">rd</span> verse, he adds that <em>ships came from Tiberias, </em>by which the multitude passed over, which had remained on the shore, blockading, as it were, every outlet, that Christ might not escape. </p></div>
