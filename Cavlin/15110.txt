<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>The waters saw thee, O God! </em>Some of the miracles in which God had displayed the power of his arm are here briefly adverted to. When it is said that the <em>waters saw God, </em>the language is figurative, implying that they were moved, as it were, by a secret instinct and impulse to obey the divine command in opening up a passage for the chosen people. Neither the sea nor the Jordan would have altered their nature, and by giving place have spontaneously afforded a passage to them, had they not both felt upon them the power of God. <span class="cite-ref">(303)</span> It is not meant that they retired backward because of any judgment and understanding which they <em>possessed, </em>but that in receding as they did, God showed that even the inanimate elements are ready to yield obedience to him. There is here an indirect contrast, it being intended to rebuke the stupidity of men if they do not acknowledge in the redemption of the Israelites from Egypt the presence and hand of God, which were seen even by the waters. What is added concerning <em>the deeps </em>intimates, that not only the surface of the waters were agitated at the sight of God, but that his power penetrated even to the deepest gulfs. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(303)</span> “‘The waters of the Red Sea,’ says Bishop Horne, ‘are here beautifully represented as endued with sensibility; as seeing, feeling, and being confounded, even to the lowest depths, at the presence and power of their great Creator, when he commanded them to open a way, and to form a wall on each side of it, until his people were passed over.’ This, in fact, is true poetry; and in this attributing of life, spirit, feeling, action, and suffering, to inanimate objects, there are no poets who can vie with those of the Hebrew nation.” — <em>Mant</em>. </p></div></div>
