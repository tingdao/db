Now, fear maketh him apt to be taught and gentle. Therefore, so often as the Lord shall strike us or cast us down,<span class="cite-ref">(218)</span> let us know that this is done that we may be brought in [to] order from our too much haughtiness.</p><p>But it is a wonder that he was not reproved for falling down at their feet. For why did Paul wink at that which (as Luke recordeth) Peter would not suffer in Cornelius? ( <span class="bvs">Act_10:26</span>.) I answer, that Paul doth therefore bear with the keeper, because he knoweth that he was not moved with superstition, but with fear of God’s judgment so to humble himself. It was a kind of worship common enough; but chiefly among the Romans it was a solemn thing when they would humbly crave any thing, or crave pardon, they fell down at their knees to whom they put their supplication. Therefore, there was no cause why Paul should be displeased with a man whom he saw simply humbled of God. For if there had been any thing committed contrary to the glory of God, he had not forgotten that zeal which he showed before among the men of Lycaonia. Therefore, by his silence, we gather that in this kind of worship there was nothing contrary to godliness or the glory of God.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(215)</span></p><p>“ Quam miraculo praeparatus,” than prepared by the miracle. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(216)</span></p><p>“ Sprevisset igitur alto animo,” hence he might have shown high contempt for. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(217)</span></p><p>“ Probrose,” disgracefully. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(218)</span></p><p>“ Aliqua consternatione tanget,” or throw us into consternation. </p></div></div>
