<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>And when I have broken the staff of your bread</em>. By these words God implies, that although He should not punish them by the sterility of the land, still He was prepared with other means for destroying them by famine. We shall indeed see hereafter that, when God was wroth, the earth in a manner shut up her bowels so as to produce no food; and that the heaven also grew hard so as not to fertilize it with dew or rain. In a word, all unseasonableness of weather and infertility of soil is a sign of the curse of God; but now He goes further, viz., that although there should be no scarcity of food, still they should suffer from hunger, when He had taken away its nourishing qualities from their bread. This curse confirms the instruction which we have seen elsewhere, that man does not live by bread, but by <span class="cite-ref">(227)</span> the command of God, just as if the efficacy contained in the bread proceeded out of His mouth. (<span class="bvs">Deu_8:3</span>.) And assuredly an inanimate thing could not give rigor to our senses except by the secret ordinance of God. He employs a very appropriate comparison, calling the support of bread, whereby man’s strength is refreshed, “the staff;” as we see the old and weak leaning on their sticks as they walk, when otherwise they would totter and fall. God says, then, that it is in His power to break this staff, so that their bread should only fill their stomachs without refreshing their strength. Ezekiel has borrowed from Moses this figure, which he makes use of in several places, (<span class="bvs">Eze_4:16</span>,) although he there adverts to two sorts of punishment, like another Prophet, when He says, “Ye have sown much and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that; earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes;” and again, </p><p>“Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it;” (<span class="bvs">Hag_1:6</span>;) </p><p>for he points out scarcity of food as one of God’s scourges, and the inability to profit by their abundance, as another; and with this Micah also accords, for after he has said, “Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied,” he adds, </p><p>“Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.” (<span class="bvs">Mic_6:14</span>.) </p><p>But Moses, in order that the curse may be more apparent, says that there shall be abundance of bread; and also that there shall be no deception practiced in kneading and baking it; for that two <span class="cite-ref">(228)</span> women shall come to one oven together, who may mutually observe whether weight is duly given. He implies, therefore, that there shall be abundance in their hands, and yet, when they are filled, they shall not be satisfied. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(227)</span> “Mais de la parole sortant de la bouche de Dieu, comme s’il inspiroit au pain la faculte de nous sustenter;” but by the word proceeding out of the mouth of God, as if He inspired the bread with the power of supporting us. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(228)</span><em>C</em>. is here at issue with the commentators in general. The usual view is that stated by Bush: “There shall be such a scarcity of bread that one ordinary oven shall answer for the baking of ten, that is a great many families; whereas in common circumstances one oven would serve (or rather be required) for one family.” Dr. Kitto supposes that “ten families, represented by their females, clubbed their dough together, and the produce being no more than an ordinary supply for <em>one </em>family, it was baked in one oven instead of each family, as usual, making a separate baking. Afterwards the cakes thus baked were proportioned by weight to the respective contributors, so precious was the bread. This is implied in the words, ‘shall deliver you <em>your </em>bread <em>again </em>by weight;’ which shews that the bread was previously theirs, and had been baked for them, not that it was <em>sold </em>to them by weight.” </p></div></div>
