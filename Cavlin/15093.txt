As under the law the custom prevailed among the Jews of vowing sacrifices for singular blessings which God had conferred upon them, by which they solemnly acknowledged that their safety depended solely upon him, and that to him they were entirely indebted for it, they are called anew to engage in this exercise of religion; and by the word <em>pay </em>it is intended to inculcate steadfastness, — to teach them that they should not make merely a sudden and inconsiderate acknowledgement, but that they should also testify at all times that the remembrance of their deliverance was deeply fixed in their hearts. Their most important business, no doubt, was seriously to reflect with themselves that God was the author of their salvation; but still it is to be observed, that the solemn profession of religion, by which every man stimulates not only himself but also others to the performance of their duty, is far from being superfluous. In the second clause, those addressed seem to be the neighboring nations; as if it had been said, that such a special manifestation of the goodness of God was worthy of being celebrated even by foreign and uncircumcised nations. <span class="cite-ref">(282)</span> But it appears to me, that the sense most agreeable to the context is, that these words are addressed either to the Levites or to all the posterity of Abraham, both of whom are not improperly said <em>to be round about God, </em>both because the tabernacle was pitched in the midst of the camp so long as the Israelites traveled in the wilderness, and also because the resting-place assigned for the ark was mount Zion, whither the people were accustomed to resort from all the surrounding parts of the country. And the Levites had intrusted to them the charge of the temple, and were appointed to keep watch and ward round about it. The word <span class="lang he-il">למורא</span><em>, lammora, </em>is referred to God by the majority of interpreters, and they translate it <em>terrible. </em>The term <em>fear </em>is, however, sometimes taken in a passive sense for God himself. <span class="cite-ref">(283)</span> If it is applied to the Gentiles and to irreligious men, <span class="cite-ref">(284)</span> the sense will be, that they shall be tributaries to God; because, being stricken with fear, they shall no longer dare to offer him any resistance. But it is more probable that this word has a reference to God, whom the prophet justly declares to be worthy of being feared, after having given such a remarkable proof of his power. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(282)</span> This is Kimchi’s interpretation: He understands by “those round about God,” the nations near the land of Israel, and so near God. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(283)</span> In this sense it is employed in <span class="bvs">Gen_31:53</span>, “And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(284)</span> If it is thus applied, the reading will be, “Let all those who are round about him bring presents on account of fear.” </p></div></div>
