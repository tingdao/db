<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Thine eyes beheld my shapelessness, etc. </em>The embryo, when first conceived in the womb, has no form; and David speaks of God’s having known him when he was yet a shapeless mass, <span class="lang el-gr">τὸ κύημα</span><em>, </em>as the Greeks term it; for <span class="lang el-gr">τὸ εμβρυον</span> is the name given to the foetus from the time of conception to birth inclusive. The argument is from the greater’ to the less. If he was known to God before he had grown to certain definite shape, much less could he now elude his observation. He adds, that <em>all things were written in his book; </em>that is, the whole method of his formation was well known to God. The term <em>book </em>is a figure taken from the practice common amongst men of helping their memory by means of books and commentaries. Whatever is an object of God’s knowledge he is said to have registered in writing, for he needs no helps to memory. Interpreters are not agreed as to the second clause. Some read <span class="lang he-il">ימים</span>, <em>yamim, </em>in the nominative case, <em>when days were made; </em>the sense being, according to them — All my bones were written in thy book, O God! from the beginning of the world, when days were first formed by thee, and when as <em>yet </em>none of them actually existed. The other is the more natural meaning, That the different parts of the human body are formed in a succession of time; for in the first germ there is no arrangement of parts, or proportion of members, but it is developed, and takes its peculiar form progressively. <span class="cite-ref">(216)</span> There is another point on which interpreters differ. As in the particle <span class="lang he-il">לא</span>, <em>lo, </em>the <span class="lang he-il">א</span>, <em>aleph, </em>is often interchangeable with <span class="lang he-il">ו</span><em>vau; </em>some read <span class="lang he-il">לו</span><em>, to him, </em>and others <span class="lang he-il">לא</span><em>not. </em>According to the first reading, the sense is, that though the body is formed progressively, it was always one and the same in God’s book, who is not dependent upon time for the execution of his work. A sufficiently good meaning, however, can be got by adhering’ without change to the negative particle, namely, that though the members were formed in the course of days, or gradually, none of them had existed; no order or distinctness of parts having been there at first, but a formless substance. And thus our admiration is directed to the providence of God in gradually giving’ shape and beauty to a confused mass. <span class="cite-ref">(217)</span></p><p><strong>(216)</strong> “<em>They </em>(my members) <em>have been daily formed, </em>or <em>forming. </em>They were not formed at once, but gradually; each day increasing in strength and size. This expression is probably parenthetical, so that the last words of the verse will refer to the writing of those things previously mentioned in God’s register.” —<em>Phillips. </em></p><p><strong>(217)</strong> “The meaning is,” says Warner, “there was a time when none of those curious parts, of which my form consists, existed. The germ of them all was planted by thee in the first instance; and gradually matured, by thy power, wisdom, and goodness, into that wonderful piece of mechanism which the human form exhibits.” Phillips gives a different turn to the clause: “<em>And not one of them, </em>or among them, was omitted. Not one of the particulars concerning my formation has been left out of thy record.” </p></div>
