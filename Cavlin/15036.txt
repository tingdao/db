<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>If I should say, I will speak thus. </em>David, perceiving the sinfulness of the thoughts with which he was tempted, puts a bridle upon himself, and reproves his inconstancy in allowing his mind to entertain doubts on such a subject. We can be at no loss in discovering his meaning; but there is some difficulty or obscurity in the words. The last Hebrew verb in the verse, <span class="lang he-il">בגד</span>, <em>bagad, </em>signifies <em>to transgress, </em>and also <em>to deceive. </em>Some, therefore, translate, <em>I have deceived the generation of thy children, </em>as if David had said, Were I to speak thus, I should defraud thy children of their hope. Others read, <em>I have transgressed against the generation of thy children; </em>that is, Were I to speak thus, I would be guilty of inflicting an injury upon them. But as the words of the prophet stand in this order<em>, Behold! the generation of thy children: I have transgressed; </em>and as a very good meaning may be elicited from them, I would expound them simply in this way: Were I to approve of such wicked thoughts and doubts, I would transgress; for, behold! the righteous are still remaining on the earth, and thou reservest in every age some people for thyself. Thus it will be unnecessary to make any supplement to complete the sense, and the verb <span class="lang he-il">בגדתי</span>, <em>bagadti, I have transgressed, </em>will read by itself, and not construed with any other part of the verse. We have elsewhere had occasion to observe, that the Hebrew noun <span class="lang he-il">דור</span>, <em>dor</em>, which we have rendered <em>generation, </em>is properly to be referred to time. The idea which David intends to convey is now perfectly obvious. Whilst worldly men give loose reins to their unhallowed speculations, until at length they become hardened, and, divesting themselves of all fear of God, cast away along with it the hope of salvation, he restrains himself that he may not rush into the like destruction. <em>To speak </em>or <em>to declare </em><span class="cite-ref">(187)</span> here signifies <em>to utter what had been meditated upon. </em>His meaning, therefore, is, that had he pronounced judgment on this subject as of a thing certain, he would have been chargeable with a very heinous transgression. He found himself before involved in doubt, but now he acknowledges that he had grievously offended; and the reason of this he places between the words in which he expresses these two states of mind: which is, because God always sees to it, that there are some of his own people remaining in the world. He seems to repeat the demonstrative particle, <em>Behold! </em>for the sake of contrast. He had a little before said, <em>Behold! these are the ungodly; </em>and here he says, <em>Behold! the generation of thy children. </em>It is assuredly nothing less than a divine miracle that the Church, which is so furiously assaulted by Satan and innumerable hosts of enemies, continues safe. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(187)</span> The word in the Hebrew text is <span class="lang he-il">ספר</span>, <em>saphar </em>Horsley translates it “to argue” — </p><p>“If I resolve to argue thus, <LineBreak />I should be a traitor to the generation of thy children.” </p><p>“The verb <span class="lang he-il">ספר</span>,” says he, “which literally signifies to count or reckon, may easily signify ‘to reason within one’s self, to syllogise,’ as is indeed the case with the corresponding words of many languages; as <span class="lang el-gr">λογιζεσθαι</span>,<em>ratiocinari</em>, <em>putare</em>, <em>reckon</em>, <em>count</em>. ” </p></div></div>
