<div class="comment-content"><p>I now come to the second kind of nakedness: the Prophet says, <em>I will waste </em>or <em>destroy her vine and her fig-tree, of which she has said, Reward are these to me; that is, </em>These things are wages to me, <em>which my lovers have given to me: and I will make them a forest, and feed on them shall the beast of the field</em>. The second part of the spoiling, as we have said, is, that the Israelites would be reduced to miserable want, who, before, had not only great abundance of good things, but also luxury, as we shall hereafter see more fully in other passages. As then they were swollen with pride on account of their prosperity, the Prophet now announces their future nakedness,<em>I will take away, </em>he says, <em>the vine and the fig-tree</em>. It is a mode of speaking by which a part is to be taken for the whole; for under the vine and the fig-tree the Prophet intended to comprehend every variety of temporal blessings. Whatever then belongs to man’s support, the Prophet here includes in these two words: and he repeats what he had said before, that the Israelites falsely thought, that it was a reward paid them for their superstitions, while they worshipped false gods. </p><p><em>She said, These are my reward. </em>The word is derived from the verb <span class="lang he-il">תנה</span><em>tene: </em>some have rendered it gift, but not rightly. I indeed allow that <span class="lang he-il">נתנו</span> “natnu”, which means to give, follows shortly after; from which some derive this word. But we know that in many parts of Scripture <span class="lang he-il">אתנה</span>, <em>atne, </em>is strictly taken for reward; and is sometimes applied to hired soldiers: but the Prophets often use this word when they speak of harlots. Hence the Prophet here introduces the people of Israel under the character of a harlot; <em>These are my reward, </em>or, <em>These things are my reward, which to me have my lovers given. </em></p><p>Since then the Israelites had so hardened themselves in their superstitions, that this false persuasion could not be driven out of them, until they were deprived of all their blessings, he announces to them this punishment, — that God would take away whatever they thought had come to them from their idols or false gods: <em>I will turn</em>, he says, <em>all these into a forest</em>, that is, “I will reduce to a waste, both the vineyards and all the well cultivated parts; so that they will produce nothing, as is usually the case with desert places.” We now understand the whole meaning of the Prophet. Let us proceed — </p></div>
