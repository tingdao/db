<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>57.</strong><em>But thanks be to God </em>From this it appears, why it it was that he made mention both of sin and of the law, when treating of death. Death has no <em>sting </em>with which to wound except <em>sin, </em>and the law imparts to this <em>sting </em>a deadly power. But Christ has conquered sin, and by conquering it has procured victory for us, and <em>has redeemed us from the curse of the law. </em>(<span class="bvs">Gal_3:13</span>.) Hence it follows, that we are no longer lying under the power of death. Hence, although we have not as yet a full discovery of those benefits, yet we may already with confidence glory in them, because it is necessary that what has been accomplished in the Head should be accomplished, also, in the members. We may, therefore, triumph over death as subdued, because Christâ€™s victory is ours. </p><p>When, therefore, he says, that <em>victory has been given to us, </em>you are to understand by this in the <em>first </em>place, that it is inasmuch as Christ has in his own person abolished sin, has satisfied the law, has endured the curse, has appeased the anger of God, and has procured life; and farther, because he has already begun to make us partakers of all those benefits. For though we still carry about with us the remains of sin, it, nevertheless, does not reign in us: though it still <em>stings </em>us, it does not do so fatally, because its edge is blunted, so that it does not penetrate into the vitals of the soul. Though the law still threatens, yet there is presented to us on the other hand, the liberty that was procured for us by Christ, which is an antidote to its terrors. Though the remains of sin still dwell in us, yet the Spirit who raised up Christ from the dead is <em>life, because of righteousness. </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_8:10</span>.) Now follows the conclusion. </p></div>
