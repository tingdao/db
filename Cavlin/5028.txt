<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget. </em>There is no contradiction in the sense, that he should first of all altogether forbid that idols should be made; and, secondly, speak only of worshipping and adoring them; for it is already in itself a wicked error to attribute any image to God; and another superstition always accompanies it, that God is always improperly worshipped in this visible symbol. There is a strong confirmation here of what I have previously stated, that whatever holds down and confines our senses to the earth, is contrary to the covenant of God; in which, inviting us to Himself, He permits us to think of nothing but what is spiritual, and therefore sets His voice against all the imaginations, whereby heathen nations have always been deceived; because they have been deprived of the light of that doctrine which would direct them to the heavenly greatness of God Himself. But those who have been taught by God’s Law, not only that He alone is to be worshipped, but that He may not be represented by any visible effigy, are justly accounted covenant-breakers, if they do not confine themselves within these bounds; for they violate that Second Commandment (<em>caput</em>) by which they are commanded to worship God spiritually; and consequently are forbidden to make to themselves likenesses, or images, whereby they would deface and pollute His glory. At the end of the verse, which some translate “the likeness, which your God hath <em>forbidden, </em>” <span class="cite-ref">(99)</span> the proper rendering is, “hath <em>commanded, </em>or <em>enjoined</em>: ” and hence the relative <span class="lang he-il">אור</span>, <em>asher, </em>must be taken, as in many other places, as an adverb of comparison. The meaning of Moses is indeed by no means obscure; viz., that we must simply obey God’s word; and that we must not dispute whether what He has forbidden is lawful or not; and that no other rule of right is to be sought for, except that we should follow what He has prescribed. Let the Papists dispute as they please, that images are not to be removed because they are useful for the people’s instruction; but let this be our wisdom, to acquiesce in what God has chosen to decree in this matter. Although the threat which is subjoined might have been placed amongst the sanctions, which we shall hereafter consider in their proper place, yet I have been unwilling to separate it from the Second Commandment, to which it is annexed. A confirmation is added in Deuteronomy; viz., that God, who has not spared foreign nations, will much less pardon His people; inasnmch as it is a greater crime, and fouler ingratitude to forsake God when once He is known, and to cast aside the teaching of His Law, than to follow errors handed down from our forefathers. I have already explained in what sense He is called a “jealous God;” but in <span class="bvs">Exo_34:14</span>, Moses has not deemed it sufficient simply to honor God with this title; but, in amplification, he has added that this is His name, in order that we may know that He can no more bear a companion, or a rival, to be compared with Him, than He can cast away His Godhead, or deny Himself. He compares Him to fire, to increase our terror of Him. We know how audaciously the world indulges itself in superstitions; so that, as if in very sport, it metamorphoses God just as fancy leads. Wherefore, in order to incline men’s minds to reverence, he sets before us in this figure God’s fearful vengeance; as though He would instantly consume them, just as fire consumes stubble, if they shall have dared to think of God otherwise than is right. </p><p><strong>(99)</strong> So the <em>V</em>. which is followed by <em>A.V</em>. and <em>S.M</em>. Our expositor seems to mean that <span class="lang he-il">אשר</span> is here equivalent to <em>even as, </em>and connects the last with the first clause of the verse; so that it should be rendered as follows, “Take heed to yourselves, etc., <em>even as </em>the Lord your God commanded you.” —<em>W</em>. The <em>Fr. </em>thus abbreviates the Latin text: “<em class="lang fr-fr">La </em><span class="lang fr-fr">ou j’ay translate, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Ce que l’Eternel vostre Dieu vous a defendu, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">vaut autant que s’il estoit dit Comme ou Selon</span>." </p></div>
