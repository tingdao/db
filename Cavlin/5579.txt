<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>When thou hast made an end of tithing. </em>In this passage Moses urgently stimulates them to offer the tithes willingly and abundantly, by placing God, as it were, before their eyes, as if they paid them into his hand: for a solemn protestation is enjoined, in which they condemn themselves as guilty before God, if they have not faithfully paid the tax imposed upon them; but they pray for grace and peace if they have honestly discharged their duty. For nothing can be more awakening to men, than when <span class="cite-ref">(219)</span> God is introduced as the judge of any particular matter. This is the reason why he commands them to protest in God’s sight that they have obeyed His ordinance in the payment of their tithes. To separate, or “bring away out of the house,” is equivalent to their being conscious of no fraud in withholding from God what was His; and thus that they were guiltless of sacrilege, since they had not diverted anything holy to their private use. What follows, “I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them,” must only be referred to the matter in hand; for it would have been too great an act of temerity and arrogance in them, to have boasted that they had kept and fulfilled the Law in every part and parcel. Still this manner of speaking signifies desire rather than perfection; as if they had said, that it was the full purpose of their minds to obey God’s precepts. We must remember, however, what I have said, that this properly refers to the legal ceremonies. With the same meaning it is soon after said, “I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me:” for if they had gloried in their perfection, they had no need of sacrifices, or other means of purification. But as I have just said, God only invites them to examine themselves, <span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> so that they may in sincerity of heart call upon Him as the witness of their piety. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(219)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’y a rien qui esveille mieux les hommes, et les touche plus au vif, que quand Dieu leur est amend et produit pour juge, et qu’ilsont adjournez comme en sa presence</span> :” there is nothing which awakens men more, or touches them more on the quick, than when God is brought forward and produced as their Judge, and when they are summoned as it were into His presence. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(220)</span> The <em>Fr. </em>gives a different turn to this, “<span class="lang fr-fr">seulement Dieu les a voulu aussi examiner, en les faisant tesmoins et juges de leur syncerite et rondeur</span> :” God only wished them also to make an examination, calling themselves as witnesses of their own sincerity and integrity. </p></div></div>
