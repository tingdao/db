<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Forty years I strove with this generation </em><span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> The Psalmist brings it forward as an aggravation of their perverse obstinacy, that God strove with them for so long a time without effect. Occasionally it will happen that there is a violent manifestation of perversity which soon subsides; but God complains that he had constant grounds of contention with his people, throughout the whole forty years. And this proves to us the incurable waywardness of that people. The word <em>generation </em>is used with the same view. The word <span class="lang he-il">דור</span>, <em>dor, </em>signifies an age, or the allotted term of human life; and it is here applied to the men of an age, as if the Psalmist had said, that the Israelites whom God had delivered were incorrigible, during the whole period of their lives. The verb <span class="lang he-il">אקוט</span>, <em>akut, </em>which I have rendered <em>I strove, </em>is, by some, translated <em>contemned, </em>and in the Septuagint it reads, <span class="lang el-gr">προσωχθισα</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(68)</span><em>I was incensed, </em>or <em>enraged; </em>but Hebrew interpreters retain the genuine meaning, That God strove with them in a continual course of contention. This was a remarkable proof of their extreme obstinacy; and God is introduced in the verse as formally pronouncing judgment upon them, to intimate, that after having shown their ungodliness in so many different ways, there could be no doubt regarding their infatuation. <em>Erring in heart, </em>is an expression intended not to extenuate their conduct, but to stamp it with folly and madness, as if he had said, that he had to do with beasts, rather than men endued with sense and intelligence. The reason is subjoined, that they would not attend to the many works of God brought under their eyes, and more than all, to his word; for the Hebrew term <span class="lang he-il">דרך</span>, <em>derech, </em>which I have rendered <em>ways, </em>comprehends his law and repeated admonitions, as well as his miracles done before them. It argued amazing infatuation that when God had condescended to dwell in such a familiar manner amongst them, and had made such illustrious displays of himself, both in word and works, they should have shut their eyes and overlooked all that had been done. This is the reason why the Psalmist, considering that they wandered in error under so much light as they enjoyed, speaks of their stupidity as amounting to madness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(67)</span> “<em>The men of that age</em>, or, as we say in English, <em>the generation </em>then upon the stage.” — <em>Stuart </em>on <span class="bvs">Heb_3:10</span>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(68)</span> “<span class="lang el-gr">προσωχθιζα</span><em>I was indignant</em>, <em>was offended at </em>The word is Helenistic.
