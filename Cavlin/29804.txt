<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>Who alone hath immortality </em>Paul labors to demonstrate that there is no happiness, no dignity or excellence, no life, out of God. Accordingly, he now says that God alone is immortal, in order to inform us, that we and all the creatures do not, strictly speaking, live, but only borrow life from Him. Hence it follows that, when we look up to God as the fountain of immortal life, we should reckon this present life as of no value. </p><p>But it is objected, that the human soul and angels have their immortality, and therefore this cannot be truly affirmed of God alone. I reply, when it is said, that God alone possesses immortality, it is not here denied that he bestows it, as he pleases, on any of his creatures. The meaning is the same as if Paul had said that God alone is immortal from himself and from his own nature, but has immortality in his power; so that it does not belong to creatures, except so far as he imparts to them power and vigor; for if you take away the power of God which is communicated to the soul of man, it will instantly fade away; and the same thing may be said about angels. Strictly speaking, therefore, immortality does not subsist in the nature of souls or of angels, but comes from another source, namely, from the secret inspiration of God, agreeably to that saying, </p><p>“In him we live, and move, and are.” (<span class="bvs">Act_17:28</span>.) </p><p>If any one wish to have a larger and more acute discussion of this subject, let him consult the twelfth book of Augustine “On the City of God.” </p><p><em>Who inhabiteth unapproachable light </em>He means two things, that God is concealed from us, and yet that the cause of obscurity is not in himself, as if be were hidden in darkness, but in ourselves, who, on account of the weak vision, or rather the dullness of our understanding, cannot approach to his light. We must understand that the <em>light </em>of God is <em>unapproachable, </em>if any one endeavor to approach to it in his own strength; for, if God did not open up the entrance to us by his grace, the prophet would not say: </p><p>“They who draw near to him are enlightened.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_34:5</span>.) </p><p>Yet it is true that, while we are surrounded by this mortal flesh, we never penetrate so far into the deepest secrets of God as to have nothing hidden from us; for </p><p>“we know in part, and we see as by a mirror, and in a riddle.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_13:9</span>.) </p><p>By faith, therefore, we enter into the light of God, but only in part. Still it is true, that it is a “light unapproachable” by man. </p><p><em>Whom no man hath seen or can see </em>This is added for the sake of additional explanation, that men may learn to look by faith to him, whom they cannot see with the bodily eyes, or even with the powers of their understanding; for I view this as referring not only to the bodily eyes, but also to the faculties of the soul. We must always consider what is the Apostle’s design. It is difficult for us to overlook and disregard all those things of which we have immediate vision, that we may endeavor to come to God, who is nowhere to be seen. For this thought always comes into our mind: “How knowest thou if there is a God, seeing that thou only hearest that he is, and dost not see him?” The Apostle fortifies us against this danger, by affirming that it ought not to be judged according to our senses, because it exceeds our capacity; for the reason why we do not see is, that our sight is not so keen as to ascend to so great a height. </p><p>There is a long dispute in Augustine on this point, because it appears to contradict what is said, in the first Epistle, </p><p>“Then shall we see him as he is, because we shall be like him.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Jo_3:2</span>.) </p><p>While he reasons on this subject in many passages, there appears to me to be none in which he explains it more clearly than in the letter which he writes to the widow Paulina. </p><p>So far as relates to the meaning of the present passage, the answer is easy, that we cannot see God in this nature, as it is said elsewhere, </p><p>“Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of God.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_15:50</span>.) </p><p>We must be renewed, that we may be like God, before it be granted to us to see him. And that our curiosity may not be beyond measure, let us always remember, that the manner of living is of more importance in this inquiry than the manner of speaking. At the same time, let us remember the judicious caution which Augustine gives us, to be on our guard lest, while we are keenly disputing how God can be seen, we lose both peace and sanctification, without which no man can ever see God. </p></div>
