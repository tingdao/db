<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Into the tray of the Gentiles </em>This makes still more evident what I have lately hinted, that the office, which was then bestowed on the apostles, had no other object than to awaken in the Jews the hope of an approaching salvation, and thus to render them more attentive to hear Christ. On this account, he now confines within the limits of Judea their voice, which he afterwards commands to sound everywhere to the farthest limits of the world. The reason is, that he had been sent by the Father to be </p><p>the minister of circumcision, to fulfill the promises, which had anciently been given to the fathers, (<span class="bvs">Rom_15:8</span>.) </p><p>Now God had entered into a special covenant with the family of Abraham, and therefore Christ acted properly in confining the grace of God, at the outset, to the chosen people, till the time for publishing it were fully come. But after his resurrection, he spread over all nations the blessing which had been promised in the second place, because then <em>the veil of the temple had been rent, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_27:51</span>,) and <em>the middle wall of partition </em>had been <em>thrown down, </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_2:14</span>.) If any one imagine that this prohibition is unkind, because Christ does not admit the Gentiles to the enjoyment of the gospel, let him contend with God, who, to the exclusion of the rest of the world, established with the seed of Abraham alone his covenant, on which the command of Christ is founded. </p></div>
