Let us then beware, lest we incur this denunciation. And <em>by judgment, </em><span class="cite-ref">(402)</span> I understand not only the punishment which is inflicted by the magistrate, as though he had only said, that they would be justly punished who resisted authority; but also the vengeance of God, however it may at length be executed: for he teaches us in general what end awaits those who contend with God. </p><p><strong>(402)</strong> “Judicium<span class="lang el-gr">,” κρίμα; </span> some render it “punishment;” [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>], “condemnation.” The word is used in both senses: but according to the tenor of the former part of the verse, it seems that the Apostle means that which is inflicted by God. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
