<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>Now we know that the law is good </em>He again anticipates the calumny with which they loaded him; for, whenever he resisted their empty display, they seized on this shield for their defense “What then? Do you wish to have the law buried, and blotted out of the remembrance of men?” In order to repel this calumny, Paul acknowledges that “the law is good,” but contends that we are required to make a lawful use of it. Here he argues from the use of cognate terms; for the word <em>lawful </em>(<em>legitimus </em>) is derived from the word <em>law </em>(<em>lex </em>). But he goes still further, and shews that the law agrees excellently with the doctrine which it teaches; and he even directs it against them. </p></div>
