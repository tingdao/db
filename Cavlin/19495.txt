<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah now assigns the reason why he was so much horrified by the insensibility which he observed in the prophets. If things were in good order, or if, at least, they were tolerable, the prophets would have more calmly addressed the Jews; for what need is there to make a great ado when men willingly follow what God commands? When, therefore, we have to do with meek and modest men, vehemence is foolish; and they who thus bestir themselves, and seek, through great ambition, to shew very fervid zeal when there is no need, are nothing but apes; but when things are in disorder and confusion, then vehemence is wanted. Jeremiah now declares that things were so extremely out of order, that the prophets could not have been silent, except they were like logs of wood. </p><p>These two things, then, ought to be connected together, — that the prophets were dumb, — and that they were dumb when there was the greatest necessity for speaking; for they saw the land filled with adulteries. Though he names adulterers, he yet condemns the crime. As then the land was polluted by adulteries and perjuries, as they all gave themselves up to do evil, it was by no means to be tolerated that the prophets should not be indignant, as though things were well ordered and peaceable. </p><p>We hence see how much God abhors sloth in the ministers of his word, in those whom he appoints as teachers in his Church, while they connive at wickedness, and heedlessly pass by adulteries, and fornications, and perjuries, and frauds, and other kinds of wrongs; for if there were even the least particle of religion in their hearts, they would certainly have been moved, and could not have been for a moment silent. For if that zeal ought to be in all God’s children, which was in the Psalmist, </p><p>“The zeal of thine house has consumed me, and the reproaches of them who reproached thee have fallen upon me,” <em><LineBreak /></em>(<span class="bvs">Psa_69:10</span>,) </p><p>how inexcusable must be the indifference of prophets, when they see God’s name exposed to mockery, and when they see every kind of wickedness prevailing? We now see not only what the Prophet teaches in this passage, but also the usefulness of his doctrine and how it ought to be applied. Let us then learn, that the more liberty men take in sinning, and the more audaciously their impiety and contempt of God break out, the more sharply ought prophets and faithful teachers to reprove and condemn them; and that it is the time of fighting, when the world thus presumptuously and furiously rise up against God. </p><p>The Prophet mentions some kinds of evil, and yet does not enumerate all kinds; but under adulteries and perjuries he includes also other crimes. As to the word <span class="lang he-il">אלה</span>, <em>ale, </em>it properly means swearing; but as cursing often accompanies it, some render it here “execration.” <span class="cite-ref">(88)</span> But I rather think that what is meant is perjury, and that swearing here is taken in a bad sense, signifying swearing falsely in the name of God. </p><p><em>Mourned, </em>he says, <em>has the land, and dried up have the pastures of the desert </em>Here the Prophet strikingly shews how shameful was that torpor of which he speaks, for the land itself cried out, and not only the land which was cultivated and had on it many men, but also the very mountains and their recesses. He says that the land was in mourning, because God shewed his judgments everywhere by rendering the fields barren, and by other means which he used as punishments. And it is a very striking mode of speaking, when the Prophet mentions the mourning of the land, as though it assumed the character of a mourner, when it saw God angry on account of the wickedness of men. It is, indeed, a kind of personification, though he does not introduce the land as speaking; but he describes mourning as it appeared in the sterility of the land, and also in hails and storms, in unseasonable rains, in droughts, and in other calamities. </p><p>Whenever then God raises his hand to punish men for their sins, if they themselves perceive it not, the very land, which is without sense and feeling, ought to fill them with shame for their madness; for mourning appears in the very land, as though it knew that God was displeased with it. When, therefore, men sleep in their sins, and thus disregard God’s vengeance, how monstrous must be their torpor! And if this be intolerable in the common people, what can be said of the prophets, who ought to proclaim such words as these, — “Cursed is he who has transgressed the precepts of this law” —<em>“ </em>cursed is he who has corrupted the worship of God” — or, “who hath dealt unjustly with his neighbor,” — and whatever else the law contains? (<span class="bvs">Deu_27:26</span>; <span class="bvs">Deu_28:47</span>.) We now then perceive how emphatical are the words when the Prophet says, <em>Mourned has the land </em>And he amplifies the same thing by saying, <em>Dried up have the beautiful places of the desert; </em>as though he had said, that God’s judgments were seen in the remotest places, not only in the plains, where the greater number of men dwelt, did the land mourn; but if any one ascended the mountains, where shepherds only with their flocks were to be found, even there the wrath of God was visible; and the very mountains cried out that God was angry; and yet men still deluded themselves, who, at the same time were expounders of the law, who were the mouth of God, and to whom he had committed the office of reproving; but they were dumb! We now understand what these words contain, and what is to be learnt from them. </p><p>He adds, that their <em>course was evil, </em><span class="cite-ref">(89)</span> and that their <em>strength was not right </em>By <em>course </em>he no doubt means their doings and all their actions, and also the aid which they proposed to themselves; for our life is called a course, because God has not created us that we may lie down in one place, but he has set before us an end for which we are to live. Therefore, by course, the Scripture means all our doings, and the <em>very </em>end for which we are to live. He then says, that all their <em>strength </em>had been <em>perverted; </em>that is, that they had applied all their powers to do evil. It then hence appears that, except the prophets had been perfidious, they would have thought it full time to cry out, when men provoked God with so much audacity in their wicked courses. It follows — </p><p><strong>(88)</strong> The early Versions and the Targum differ as to this word: the Sept., the Syr., and the Arab. have “on account of these,” that is, adulterers; the Vulg.,” on account of a curse,” that is of God; the Targ., “on account of false swearing.” Blayney says, that there is nothing here about swearing, and renders the words “because of these:” but the 14<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse (<span class="bvs">Jer_23:14</span>) decides the question, where we have “adultery” and “walking in lies,” ascribed to the same persons, the prophets. That, <span class="lang he-il">אלה</span> means sometimes “false swearing,” is evident from <span class="bvs">Hos_4:2</span>; and in <span class="bvs">Hos_10:4</span>, we have the word “falsely” added to it. Their false swearing was their unfaithfulness to God’s covenant, their apostasy in worshipping idols. And the charge of being “adulterers” seems to refer to their spiritual adultery — their idolatry, and not as Calvin and others think, to that which is natural. Everything in the context favors this view; their wickedness was found in God’s house, verse 11 (<span class="bvs">Jer_23:11</span>); and a comparison is made between them and the Samaritan prophets, verse 14 (<span class="bvs">Jer_23:14</span>). The construction of this verse leads us to the same conclusion: when two <span class="lang he-il">כי</span> occur in succession, as here, they may be rendered as and so, — </p><p>As the land has been filled with adulterers, So for false swearing has the land mourned, Withered have the pastures of the wilderness; And their course has become calamitous, And their strength not firm, (that is, to run their course.) </p><p>Houbigant and Horsley have re-arranged the whole verse, and made several transpositions. Had these learned men for a moment reflected how such delocations of words, as they suppose, could have taken place, they would have, no doubt, restrained their innovating propensities. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(89)</strong> That the word means “course,” is evident from <span class="bvs">Jer_8:6</span>, where it can have no other meaning. So it is rendered by the Sept. and the Vulg. Blayney gives it another meaning. </p><p>Their will also hath been wickedness, <LineBreak />And their might without right. </p><p>He derives it from <span class="lang he-il">רצה</span>, to choose, and not from <span class="lang he-il">ריף</span>, run: but the sense of the last line is hardly discernible. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
