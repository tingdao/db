<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>For Agar is mount Sinai </em><span class="cite-ref">(78)</span> I shall not waste time in refuting the expositions of other writers; for Jerome’s conjecture, that Mount Sinai had two names, is trifling; and the disquisitions of Chrysostom about the agreement of the names are equally unworthy of notice. Sinai is called Hagar, <span class="cite-ref">(79)</span> because it is a type or figure, as the Passover was Christ. The situation of the mountain is mentioned by way of contempt. It lies in Arabia, beyond the limits of the holy land, by which the eternal inheritance was prefigured. The wonder is, that in so familiar a matter they erred so egregiously. </p><p><em>And answers, on the other hand. </em>The Vulgate translates it, <em>is joined </em>(conjunctus est) to Jerusalem; and Erasmus makes it, <em>borders on </em>(confinis) Jerusalem; but I have adopted the phrase, <em>on the other hand, </em>(ex adverso,) in order to avoid obscurity. For the apostle certainly does not refer to nearness, or relative position, but to resemblance, as respects the present comparison. The word<span class="lang el-gr">, σύστοιχα, </span> which is translated <em>corresponding to</em>, denotes those things which are so arranged as to have a mutual relation to each other, and a similar word<span class="lang el-gr">, συατοιχία, </span> when applied to trees and other objects, conveys the idea of their following in regular order. Mount Sinai is said (<span class="lang el-gr">συστοιχεῖν</span>) <em>to correspond to </em>that which is now Jerusalem, in the same sense as Aristotle says that Rhetoric is (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀντίστροφος</span>) the <em>counterpart </em>to Logic, by a metaphor borrowed from lyric compositions, which were usually arranged in two parts, so adapted as to be sung in harmony. In short, the word<span class="lang el-gr">, συστοιχεῖ, </span><em>corresponds</em>, means nothing more than that it belongs to the same class. </p><p>But why does Paul compare the present Jerusalem with Mount Sinai? Though I was once of a different opinion, yet I agree with Chrysostom and Ambrose, who explain it as referring to the earthly Jerusalem, and who interpret the words, <em>which now is </em><span class="lang el-gr">, τὣ νῦν ̔ιερουσαλὴμ, </span> as marking the slavish doctrine and worship into which it had degenerated. It ought to have been a lively image of the new Jerusalem, and a representation of its character. But such as it now is, it is rather related to Mount Sinai. Though the two places may be widely distant from each other, they are perfectly alike in all their most important features. This is a heavy reproach against the Jews, whose real mother was not Sarah but the spurious Jerusalem, twin sister of Hagar; who were therefore slaves born of a slave, though they haughtily boasted that they were the sons of Abraham. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(78)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car Agar est la montagne de Sina en Arabie, et est correspondante a Ierusalem; ou, Sina est une montagne en Arabie, correspondante a Ierusalem</span>.” “For Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem; or, Sinai is a mountain in Arabia, which corresponds to Jerusalem.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(79)</span> “Several critics have thought it so extraordinary, that they have attempted to alter it from mere conjecture, as may be seen in Bowyer’s ‘Critical Conjectures.’ But no man, who knew that the Arabic word ‘Hagar’ meant <em>a rock</em>, could think of making an alteration in this passage; for it is obvious that <span class="lang el-gr">τὸ ̀̔Αγαρ</span>, in the neuter gender, cannot signify the woman <em>Hagar</em>; and Paul has not been guilty of a grammatical error, since the passage must be translated, ‘The word Hagar denotes Mount Sinai in Arabia.’“ — Michaelis. </p><p>“That this was an appellation of Sinai among the people of the surrounding country, we have the testimony of Chrysostom and the ancient commentators, which is also confirmed by the accounts of modern travellers. And it might well have it, since <span class="lang he-il">הגר</span> (<em>hagar</em>) in Arabia signifies a rock, or rocky mountain; and as Sinai is remarkably such, it might be <span class="lang el-gr">κατ ᾿ ἐξοχὴν</span>, called <span class="lang el-gr">τὸ ̀̔Αγαρ</span>.” — Bloomfield. </p></div></div>
