<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Not holding the Head</em>. He condemns in the use of one word whatever does not bear a relation to Christ. He also confirms his statement on the ground that all things flow from him, and depend upon him. Hence, should any one call us anywhere else than to Christ, though in other respects he were big with heaven and earth, he is empty and full of wind: let us, therefore, without concern, bid him farewell. Observe, however, of whom he is speaking, namely, of those who did not openly reject or deny Christ, but, not accurately understanding his office and power, by seeking out other helps and means of salvation, (as they commonly speak,) were not firmly rooted in him. </p><p><em>From whom the whole body by joints. </em>He simply means this, that the Church does not stand otherwise than in the event of all things being furnished to her by Christ, the <em>Head</em>, and, accordingly, that her entire safety <span class="cite-ref">(411)</span> consists in him. The body, it is true, has its nerves, its <em>joints</em>, <em>and ligaments</em>, but all these things derive their vigor solely from the Head, so that the whole binding of them together is from that source. What, then, must be done? The constitution of the body will be in a right state, if simply the Head, which furnishes the several members with everything that they have, is allowed, without any hinderance, to have the pre-eminence. This Paul speaks of as the <em>increase of God</em>, by which he means that it is not every increase that is approved by God, but only that which has a relation to the Head. For we see that the kingdom of the Pope is not merely tall and large, but swells out into a monstrous size. As, however, we do not there see what Paul here requires in the Church, what shall we say, but that it is a humpbacked body, and a confused mass that will fall to pieces of itself. </p><p><strong>(411)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Toute la perfection de son estre</span>;” — “The entire perfection of her being.” </p></div>
