The flesh is willing to flatter itself, and many who now give themselves every indulgence, promise to themselves an easy entrance into life. Thus men practice mutual deception on each other, and fall asleep in wicked indifference. To shake off from his own people those flattering hopes, Christ declares that those who calculate that their possession of life is already certain, will be shut out. <span class="cite-ref">(473)</span></p><p><strong>(473)</strong> Our author appears to have become apprehensive that this language was ambiguous, and, lest it might be interpreted differently from what he intended, he has taken care to insert in the French Version an explanatory clause: “<span class="lang fr-fr">que ceux qui se font accroire qu'ils sont desia tout asseurez de la vie eternelle, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">et cheminent a leur plaisir sans souci, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">en seront rejettez</span>;” —”that those who make themselves believe that they are already perfectly assured of eternal life, <em>and walk on at their pleasure without concern, </em>will be excluded from it.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
