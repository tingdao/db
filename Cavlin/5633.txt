<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>The Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee</em>. He now proceeds to diseases which are as it were the lictors of God; and finally, His executioners, if men pertinaciously continue in their ungodliness. He does not, therefore, merely declare that He will send the pestilence, but that He will cause it to cleave to them, and when it shall have once laid hold of them, that it shall be impossible to remove it. It might also be translated, The Lord shall cause that the pestilence should seize thee; but with the same meaning, viz., that the pestilence should be fixed, or glued (<em>agglutinatam</em>) upon them, until it should consume them in the Holy Land itself. He adds <em>phthisis</em>, or consumption, which disease emaciates the body, and gradually exhausts its juices. It is superfluous to speak particularly of the other diseases, only let us learn that, whilst the multitude of diseases is almost innumerable, they are all so many ministers (<em>satellites</em>) prepared to execute God’s vengeance. It is true, indeed, that diseases are contracted in various ways, and especially by intemperance; still, this does not prevent God from smiting the transgressors of the Law with them, although no natural cause may be apparent. He adds war, which He designates by the name of “the sword,” but of this curse He will soon speak more fully. </p><p>He then unfolds in more distinct detail what He had before adverted to with respect to the curse on the produce of the land. And, first, He names two blights of the corn, which destroy it just as it is ripening, and snatch the bread, as it were, out of men’s mouths; for <em>dryness </em><span class="cite-ref">(238)</span> is not here used for all want of moisture in the soil, but for that emptying of the ears, which is caused by the east wind. <em>Mildew </em>occurs from the sudden heat of the sun, if it strikes upon the corn when moistened with cold dew. Now, although these evils arise from natural causes, still God, the Author of nature, in His supreme power, so controls the atmosphere, that its unwholesomeness is His undoubted scourge. <span class="cite-ref">(239)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(238)</span> “<em>Ariditas</em>. ” — <em>Lat</em>. “Blasting.” — <em>A</em>. <em>V</em>. ; “<em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , (says Ainsworth,) of corn and fruit with a dry wind, <span class="bvs">2Kg_19:26</span>, for the original word signifieth <em>dryness</em>; and such was the east wind that blasted in those parts, <span class="bvs">Gen_41:6</span>.
