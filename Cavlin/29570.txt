<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>Whom he raised up</em>. He makes mention here of Christ’s resurrection, on which the hope of our resurrection is founded, for death everywhere besets us. Hence, unless we learn to look to Christ, our minds will give way at every turn. By the same consideration, he admonishes them that Christ is to be <em>waited for from heaven</em>, because we will find nothing in the world to bear us up, <span class="cite-ref">(517)</span> while there are innumerable trials to overwhelm us. Another circumstance must be noticed; <span class="cite-ref">(518)</span> for as Christ rose for this end — that he might make us all at length, as being his members, partakers of the same glory with himself, Paul intimates that his resurrection would be vain, unless he again appeared as their Redeemer, and extended to the whole body of the Church the fruit and effect of that power which he manifested in himself. <span class="cite-ref">(519)</span></p><p><strong>(517)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et faire demeurer fermes</span>;” — “And make us remain firm.” </p><p><strong>(518)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A laquelle ceci se rapporte</span>;” — “To what this refers.” </p><p><strong>(519)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Laquelle il a vne fois monstree en sa personne</span>;” — “Which he once shewed in his own person.” </p></div>
