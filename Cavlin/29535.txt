<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18</strong><em>Wives, be subject. </em>Now follow particular duties, as they are called, <span class="cite-ref">(456)</span> which depend on the calling of individuals. In handling these it were superfluous to take up many words, inasmuch as I have already stated in the Epistle to the Ephesians <span class="cite-ref">(457)</span> almost everything that was necessary. Here I shall only add briefly such things as are more particularly suited to an exposition of the passage before us. </p><p>He commands <em>wives </em>to be <em>subject</em>. This is clear, but what follows is of doubtful signification — <em>as it is fit in the Lord. </em>For some connect it thus — “Be subject in the Lord, as it is fit.” I, however, view it rather differently, — <em>As it is fit in the Lord</em>, that is, according to the appointment of the Lord, so that he confirms the subjection of wives by the authority of God. He requires <em>love </em>on the part of <em>husbands, </em>and <em>that they be not bitter</em>, because there is a danger lest they should abuse their authority in the way of tyranny. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(456)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les enseignemens concernans le deuoir particulier d’vn chacun</span>;” — “Instructions relating to the particular duty of each individual.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(457)</span> I believe Calvin is referring to his commentary on <span class="bvs">Eph_5:21</span>, — v.41 p. 317. — <em>fj. </em></p></div></div>
