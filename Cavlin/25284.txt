<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_8:38</span><strong>.</strong><em>And the men requested </em>The Gadarenes cannot endure to have Christ among them but he who has been delivered from the devil is desirous to leave his own country and follow him. Hence we learn how wide is the difference between the knowledge of the <em>goodness, </em>and the knowledge of the <em>power, </em>of God. <em>Power </em>strikes men with terror, makes them fly from the presence of God, and drives them to a distance from him: but <em>goodness </em>draws them gently, and makes them feel that nothing is more desirable than to be united to God. Why Christ refuses to have this man as one of his followers we cannot determine with certainty, if it was not that he expected the man to make himself more extensively useful by communicating to his Gentile countrymen the remarkable and extraordinary act of kindness which he had received; and this he actually did, as we are assured by Mark and Luke. </p></div>
