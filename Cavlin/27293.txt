<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Opening his mouth. </em>We have already said, that the Scripture useth this phrase when it doth signify that there was any grave or weighty oration or speech made. In the fifth of Matthew, (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:1</span>,) it is said that Jesus opened his mouth when he would preach to his disciples, and intreat of most weighty matters, as if a man should say in Latin, he began to speak, having first well bethought himself what he would speak. </p><p><em>In truth I find. </em><span class="lang el-gr">Καταλαμβανεσθαι</span> is to apprehend, or to gather by reasons, signs, and conjectures. Cornelius was a Gentile born, yet God heareth his prayers; he vouchsafeth to show him the light of the gospel; he appointed and sendeth an angel to him particularly; thereby doth Peter know that, without respect of persons, those do please God which live godly and innocently. For before, (being wholly possessed with this prejudice, that the Jews alone were beloved of God, as they alone were chosen out of all people,) [nations,] he did not think that the grace of God could come unto others. He was not, indeed, so gross that he thought that godliness and innocency of life were condemned because they were in a man that was a Gentile; but, seeing he did simply snatch at that, <span class="cite-ref">(696)</span> that all those were estranged from the kingdom of God, and were profane, which were uncircumcised, he entangleth himself unawares in that so filthy an error, that God did despise his pure worship and an holy life, where there was no circumcision; because uncircumcision made all virtues unsavory to the Jews. By which example, we are taught how greatly we ought to beware of prejudices, which make us oftentimes judge amiss. </p><p>Furthermore, we must note what the word <em>person </em>doth signify, because many are thereby deceived, whilst that they expound it generally, that one man is preferred before another. So Pelagius denied in times past that some are chosen and some are [re]proved <span class="cite-ref">(697)</span> of God; because God did not accept persons. But by this word we must understand the external state or appearance, as they call it; and whatsoever is about man himself, which doth either bring him in favor, or cause him to be hated; riches, nobility, multitude of servants, honor, do make a man to be in great favor; poverty, baseness of lineage, and such like things, make him to be despised. In this respect, the Lord doth oftentimes forbid the accepting of persons, because men cannot judge aright so often as external respects do lead them away from the matter. <span class="cite-ref">(698)</span> In this place, it is referred unto the nation; and the meaning is, that circumcision is no let, but that God may allow <span class="cite-ref">(699)</span> righteousness in a man that is a Gentile. But it shall seem by this means that God did respect persons for a time. For, when as he did choose the Jews to be his people, passing over the Gentiles, did he not respect persons? I answer, that the cause of this difference ought not to be sought in the persons of men, but it doth wholly depend upon the hidden counsel of God. For, in that he rather adopted Abraham, that with him he might make his covenant, than the Egyptians, he did not this being moved with any external respect, but (all) the whole cause remained in his wonderful counsel. Therefore, God was never tied to persons. </p><p>Notwithstanding, the doubt is not as yet dissolved, <span class="cite-ref">(700)</span> because it cannot be denied but that circumcision did please God, so that he counted him one of his people who had that token of sanctification. But we may easily answer this also that circumcision followed after the grace of God, forasmuch as it was a seal thereof. Whereupon it followeth that it was no cause thereof. Nevertheless, it was unto the Jews a pledge of free adoption; in such sort, that uncircumcision did not hinder God, but that he might admit what Gentiles he would unto the society of the same salvation. But the coming of Christ had this new and especial thing, that after that the wall of separation was pulled down, (<span class="bvs">Eph_2:14</span>,) God did embrace the whole world generally. And this do the words <em>in every nation </em>import. For so long as Abraham’s seed was the holy inheritance of God, the Gentiles might seem to be quite banished from his kingdom; but when Christ was given to be a light of the Gentiles, the covenant of eternal life began to be common to all alike. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(696)</span> “Illud arriperet,” laid hold of the fact. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(697)</span> “Reprobari,” reprobated. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(698)</span> “Judicem a causa abducunt,” lead the judge away from the cause. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(699)</span> “Gratam habeat ac probet,” may approve and be pleased with. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(700)</span> “Nondum tamen soluta est difficultas,” the difficulty, however, is not yet solved. </p></div></div>
