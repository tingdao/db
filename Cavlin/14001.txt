<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>Let mine enemy pursue </em>It is a striking proof of the great confidence which David had in his own integrity, when he is willing to endure any kind of punishment, however dreadful, provided he should be found guilty of any crime. If we could bring a good conscience like this before God, his hand would be more quickly stretched forth to afford us immediate assistance. But as it often happens that those who molest us have been provoked by us, or that we burn with the desire of revenge when offended, we are unworthy of receiving succour from God; yea, our own impatience shuts the gate against our prayers. In the first place, David is prepared to be given over to the will of his enemies, that they may <em>seize his life, and throw it down to the ground; </em>and then to be publicly exhibited as an object of their mockery, so that, even after he is dead, he may lie under eternal disgrace. Some think that the <span class="lang he-il">כבוד</span><em>kebod, </em>which we have translated <em>glory, </em>is here to be taken for <em>life, </em>and thus there will be three words, <em>soul, life, glory, </em>signifying the same thing. But it appears to me, that the meaning of the passage will be fuller if we refer the word <em>glory </em>to his memory, or his good name, as if he had said, Let my enemy not only destroy me, but, after having put me to death, let him speak of me in the most reproachful terms, so that my name may be buried in mire or filth. </p></div>
