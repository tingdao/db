<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>In the chair of Moses. </em>Reasons were not wanting for inserting here what Luke relates at a different place. Besides that the doctrine is the same, I have no doubt that <em>Luke, </em>after having said that the scribes were sharply and severely reproved by our Lord, added also the other reproofs which Matthew delayed till the proper place; for already we have frequently seen that the Evangelists, as occasion required, collected into one place various discourses of Christ. But as the narrative of Matthew is more full, I choose rather to take his words as the subject of exposition. </p><p>Our Lord gives a general exhortation to believers to beware of conforming their life to the wicked conduct of <em>the scribes, </em>but, on the contrary, to regulate it by the rule of the Law which they hear from the mouth of <em>the scribes; </em>for it was necessary (as I have lately hinted) that he should reprove many abuses in them, that the whole people might not be infected. Lest, through their crimes, the doctrine of which they were the ministers and heralds should be injured, he enjoins believers to attend to their words, and not to their actions; as if he had said, that there is no reason why the bad examples of pastors should hinder the children of God from holiness of life. That the word <em>scribes, </em>agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, denotes the teachers or expounders of the <em>Law, </em>is well known; and it is certain that Luke calls the same persons <em>lawyers </em><span class="cite-ref">(89)</span></p><p>Now our Lord refers peculiarly to the Pharisees, who belonged to the number of <em>the scribes, </em>because at that time this sect held the highest rank in the government of the Church, and in the exposition of Scripture. For we have formerly mentioned that, while the <em>Sadducees </em>and <em>Essenes </em>preferred the literal interpretation of Scripture, the <em>Pharisees </em>followed a different manner of teaching, which had been handed down, as it were, to them by their ancestors, which was, to make subtle inquiries into the mystical meaning of Scripture. This was also the reason why they received their name; for they are called <em>Pherusim, </em>that is, expounders. <span class="cite-ref">(90)</span> And though they had debased the whole of Scripture by their false opinions, yet, as they plumed themselves on that popular method of instruction, their authority was highly esteemed in explaining the worship of God and the rule of holy life. The phrase ought, therefore, to be thus interpreted: <em>“The Pharisees and other scribes, </em>or, <em>the scribes, among whom the Pharisees are the most highly esteemed, </em>when they speak to you, are good teachers of a holy life, but by their works they give you very bad instructions; and therefore attend to their lips rather than to their hands.” </p><p>It may now be asked, Ought we to submit to all the instructions of teachers without exception? For it is plain enough, that the scribes of that age had wickedly and basely corrupted the Law by false inventions, had <em>burdened </em>wretched souls by unjust laws, and had corrupted the worship of God by many superstitions; but Christ wishes their doctrine to be observed, as if it had been unlawful to oppose their tyranny. The answer is easy. He does not absolutely compare any kind of doctrine with the life, but the design of Christ was, to distinguish the holy Law of God from their profane works. For to <em>sit in the chair of Moses </em>is nothing else than to teach, according to the Law of God, how we ought to live. And though I am not quite certain whence the phrase is derived, yet there is probability in the conjecture of those who refer it to the <em>pulpit </em>which <em>Ezra </em>erected, from which the Law was read aloud, (<span class="bvs">Neh_8:4</span>.) Certainly, when the Rabbis expounded Scripture, those who were about to speak rose up in succession; but it was perhaps the custom that the Law itself should be proclaimed from a more elevated spot. That man, therefore, <em>sits in the chair of Moses </em>who teaches, not from himself, or at his own suggestion, but according to the authority and word of God. But it denotes, at the same time, a lawful calling; for Christ commands that the scribes should be heard, because they were the public teachers of the, Church. </p><p>The Papists reckon it enough, that those who issue laws should possess the title and occupy the station; for in this way they torture the words of Christ to mean, that we are bound to receive obediently whatever the ordinary prelates of the Church enjoin. But this calumny is abundantly refuted by another injunction of Christ, when he bids them <em>beware of the leaven of the Pharisees</em>, (<span class="bvs">Mat_16:6</span>.) </p><p>If Christ pronounces it to be not only lawful, but even proper, to reject whatever of their own the scribes mingle with the pure doctrine of the Law, certainly we are not bound to embrace, without discrimination or the exercise of judgment, whatever they are pleased to enjoin. Besides, if Christ had intended here to bind the consciences of his followers to the commandments of men, there would have been no good ground for what he said in another passage, that <em>it is in vain to worship God by the commandments of men</em>, (<span class="bvs">Mat_15:9</span>.) </p><p>Hence it is evident, that Christ exhorts the people to obey the scribes, only so far as they adhere to the pure and simple exposition of the Law. For the exposition of, <em>Augustine </em>is accurate, and in accordance with Christ’s meaning, that, “the scribes taught the Law of God while they <em>sat in the chair of Moses; </em>and, therefore, that the sheep ought to hear the voice of the Shepherd by them, as by hirelings.” To which words he immediately adds: “God therefore teaches by them; but if they wish to teach any thing of their own, refuse to hear, refuse to do them.” With this sentiment accords what the same writer says in his Fourth Book of Christian Doctrine: “Because good believers do not obediently listen to any sort of man, but to God himself; therefore we may profitably listen even to those whose lives are not profitable.” It was, therefore, not <em>the chair </em>of the scribes, but <em>the chair of Moses, </em>that constrained them to teach what was good, even when they did not do what was good. For what they did in their life was their own; but <em>the chair </em>of another man did not permit them to teach what was their own. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(89)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Docteurs de la loy</span>;” — “teachers,” or “doctors of the law.” Harmony, vol. 1, p. 281. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(90)</span><em>Harmony, </em>vol 1, p. 281. </p></div></div>
