<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt, </em>Here he relates how the people immediately, from the very commencement of their emancipation from bondage, were ungrateful to God, and conducted themselves in a rebellious manner. Nor does he confine himself to the history of one period only, but the whole drift of his narrative is to point out that the people had never ceased from doing wickedly, although God met them in return with inconceivable kindness; which is a proof of the invincible and desperate perversity of this nation. He first blames the folly of the people as the occasion of such ingratitude. In calling it folly, he does not intend to lessen the offense, (as some are often wont to do,) but to expose the vile and disgraceful stupidity of the people, in being blind in matters so plain; for God’s works were such that even the blind might behold them. Whence could such gross ignorance originate, unless that Satan had so maddened them that they did not regard the miracles of God, which might have moved the very stones? Now, when he adds, <em>they remembered not, </em>he expresses more forcibly the inexcusable nature of their ignorance, nay, that their blindness was the result of stupid indifference, more than the want of proper instruction. For the cause of their ignorance was their overlooking those matters which, in themselves, were abundantly manifest. He further mentions how quickly that forgetfulness came upon them, which tended to increase their guilt. For it was marvelous that not even the very sight of these things could arouse their spirits. Hence it came to pass, that while they had scarcely made their departure from Egypt, and were passing through the sea, they proudly rose up against their deliverer. Surely not one year, nor even a century, ought to have erased from their minds deeds so worthy of being remembered. What madness, then, at that very time to murmur against God, as if he had abandoned them to be slaughtered by their enemies? That arm of the sea through which the people passed is, in the Hebrew, called <em>the Sea of Suph. </em>Some translate it <em>the Sea of Sedge, </em>and will have the word <span class="lang he-il">סופ</span>, <em>suph, </em>to signify <em>sea-weed. </em><span class="cite-ref">(244)</span> But whatever be its derivation, there can be no doubt about the place. It is very likely that the name was given to it because it abounded with rushes. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(244)</span> “<em>At the Red Sea, i.e., at the Arabian Gulf</em>; literally, <em>at the Sea of Suph, </em>which, if Suph be not here a proper name, (as it seems to be in <span class="bvs">Deu_1:1</span> and, with a slight variation, in <span class="bvs">Num_21:14</span>) means <em>the sea of weeds</em>; and that sea is still called by a similar name in modern Egypt. This, its designation throughout the books of the Old Testament, is in the Syriac version and the Chaldee paraphrase likewise rendered <em>the sea of weeds</em>; which name may have been derived from the weeds growing near its shore, or from the weeds, or coralline productions, with which, according to Diodorus Siculus and Kircher, it abounded; and which were seen through its translucent waters. Finati, quoted by Laborde, speaks of the transparency of its waters, and the corals seen at its bottom ” — <em>Cresswell. </em>It has sometimes been asserted that this sea received the appellation of <em>Red </em>from its color. But it has been abundantly attested by those who have seen it, that it is no more red than any other sea. Niebuhr, in his description of Arabia, says, “The Europeans are accustomed to give the Arabian Gulf the name of Red Sea; nevertheless, I have not found it any more <em>red </em>than the Black Sea or the White Sea, or any other sea in the world.” Artemidorus in Strabo expressly tells us that “it looks of a <em>green </em>color, by reason of the abundance of <em>sea-weed </em>and moss that grow in it;” which Diodorus Siculus also asserts of a particular part of it. It appears to have derived its name of “Red Sea” from Edom, which signifies <em>red. </em>Although throughout the whole Scriptures of the Old Testament it is called <em>Yam Suph, the weedy sea, </em>yet among the ancient inhabitants of the countries adjoining it was called <em>Yam Edom, the sea of Edom, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Kg_9:26</span>; <span class="bvs">2Ch_8:17</span>,) the land of Edom having extended to the Arabian Gulf; and the Edomites or Idumeans having occupied at one time a part, if not the whole, of Arabia Petraea. The Greeks, who took the name of the sea from the Phoenicians, who called it <em>Yam Edom, </em>instead of rendering it <em>the sea of Edom, </em>or, <em>the Idumean Sea, </em>as they ought to have done, took the word Edom, by mistake, for an appellative, instead of a proper name, and accordingly rendered it <span class="lang el-gr">ερυθρα θαλασσα</span>, that is, <em>the Red Sea. </em>Hence the LXX. translate <em>Yam Suph, </em>by the <em>Red Sea</em>; in which they have been followed by the authors of our English version. But <em>the sea of weeds </em>is undoubtedly the best translation of the Hebrew text. — See <em>Prideaux </em>’<em>Connections, etc., </em>volume 1, pages 39, 40. </p></div></div>
