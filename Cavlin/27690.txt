<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong>Whereas some accuse Paul of subtilty,<span class="cite-ref">(483)</span> as if he did play the hypocrite, I have before refuted this. Yet I do not deny but that he granted to do thus much at the request of the brethren, being thereunto in a manner enforced. Therefore, it hath more color, and is (as they say) more disputable, that he was too easily entreated, and too ready to obey; and yet I do not admit that which some men say, that it went not well with Paul, because, taking upon him a new and unwonted person, he did not so constantly, as he was wont, maintain the liberty purchased by Christ. I confess, indeed, that God doth oftentimes punish foolish purposes with unhappy success; but I see not why this should be applied to Paul, who through voluntary subjection sought to win the favor of the rude, and such as were not thoroughly instructed, that he might do them good; being about to do that not willingly, but because he had rather yield to the brethren than stick to his own judgment. Furthermore, when he was once admitted, he might fitly have passed over to moderate that zeal. His courtesy doth rather deserve great praise, in that he doth not only gently abase himself for the unskillful people’s sake, but doth also obey<span class="cite-ref">(484)</span> their foolishness who did unworthily, and against reason, suspect him. He might well have reproved<span class="cite-ref">(485)</span> them, because they had been so ready to believe reports contrary to his estimation [reputation]. In that he abstaineth, he showeth great patience; in that he winneth their favor so carefully, it is singular modesty.</p><p>Moreover, he might have been more rough and round with<span class="cite-ref">(486)</span> James and his fellows in office, because they had not been more diligent to root out errors from among the people. For though it be certain that they taught faithfully, yet it may be that the sight of the temple, and the very seat of the law, did hinder them in defending the use of liberty. But Paul, whether he went from his right of his own accord, or whether he think that they see better what is expedient than he, doth follow<span class="cite-ref">(487)</span> their counsel. And whereas false Nicodemites, following this example of Paul, go about to color their treacherous dissimulation, whilst they pollute themselves with all filthiness of Popery, it needeth no long refutation. They boast that they do this to win the weak brethren, (or that they follow their vein thus far) as if Paul did yield to them in all things without choice. If, being Jews, they should take upon them according to the pre-script of the law, to fulfill among the Jews a vow infected with no idolatry, then might they prove themselves to be like Paul. Now, forasmuch as they inwrap themselves in gross and altogether wicked superstitions, and that because they will escape the cross, what likelihood is that which they imagine?<span class="cite-ref">(488)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(483)</span></p><p>“ Astutiae,” craftiness. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(484)</span></p><p>“ Morem gerit,” defer to. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(485)</span></p><p>“ Expostulasset,” expostulated with. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(486)</span></p><p>“ Durior,” more severe on. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(487)</span></p><p>“ Acquiescit,” acquiesces in. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(488)</span></p><p>“ Qualis ista est quam fingunt similitudo,” what resemblance is there in it to that which they feign. </p></div></div>
