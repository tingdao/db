<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>Ye shall certainly be </em><span class="cite-ref">(33)</span><em>as an oak whose leaf fadeth </em>The Hebrew particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span> (<em>ki</em>) may be taken in an affirmative sense, as I have translated it; and the Prophet appears to allude to those groves to which they had improperly restricted the worship of God; for, having mentioned <em>gardens</em>, he reproaches them with the confidence which they placed in theme and threatens drought. “You take pleasure,” says he, “in your gardens and trees, but you shall be like withered trees that have lost their foliage.” God therefore mocks the vain boasting of idolaters, who marvellously flatter themselves with their contrivances, and think that heaven is open to them, when they are employed in their ceremonies. Just as at the present day, when the papists have lighted their lamps and adorned their temples, when they dazzle with gold and precious stones, when they have played on their organs and rung their bells, they imagine that they are the happiest of all men, as if there were now no reason to dread that any evil should come to them from God, who had received from them a hundredfold satisfaction. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(33)</span><em>For ye shall be</em>. — Eng.
