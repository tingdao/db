The phrase is directed against the foolish, or rather frantic, confidence with which the wicked are inflated, when they recklessly deride the judgments of God; and, what is more, scruple not to magnify themselves against him, as if they were not subject to his power. The last clause is to be particularly noticed: <em>for their deceit is falsehood </em><span class="cite-ref">(439)</span> By these words the prophet teaches, that the wicked gain nothing by their wiles, but that they are rather entangled in them, or at length discover that they were mere sleight of hand. Those ignorantly mar the sense who interpose the copula <em>and, </em>as if it had been said, that <em>deceit and falsehood were in them </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">רמוה</span>,<em>remyah, </em>signifies <em>a subtle and crafty device. </em>Interpreters, indeed, often translate it <em>thought; </em>but this term does not sufficiently express the propriety and force of the Hebrew word. The prophet means, that, however well pleased the wicked are with their own cunning, they yet do nothing else than deceive themselves with falsehood. And it was needful to add this clause; for we see how the great bulk of mankind are fatally intoxicated with their own vain imaginations, and how difficult it is to believe what is here asserted, — that the more shrewd they are in their own estimation, the more do they deceive themselves. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(439)</span> Dimock thinks that, by this expression, the Psalmist; probably alludes to the <em>Lex Talionis </em> amongst the Jews, and that the Apostle might refer to this passage in <span class="bvs">2Th_2:11</span>; where he says, “that God should send them strong <em>delusion</em>, that they should believe a <em>lie</em>. ” </p></div></div>
