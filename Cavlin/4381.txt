<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam. </em>This passage shews us, like many others, that the errors wherein Satan entangles unbelievers are derived from good principles. The modesty of king Balak appears to be worthy of praise, in that, conscious of his own weakness, and placing no confidence in human aid, he sets about imploring the help of God. For this is our only safe refuge, although earthly aids may fail us, still to maintain our courage, and to rely upon God, who is all-sufficient in Himself, and independent of external means. Thus far, then, Balak acts rightly, for he seeks nothing more than to conciliate God’s favor, nor places his confidence of victory in anything but God’s good-will; but, when he seeks for God amiss by circuitous ways, he departs far from Him. And this is a common error with all hypocrites and unbelievers, that, whilst they aspire after God, they wander into indirect paths of their own. Balak desires Divine deliverance from his danger; but the means are of his own device, when he would purchase incantations from a mercenary prophet; thus it is, that he binds down God, and subjects Him to his own inventions. He knows, he says, that the power of blessing and cursing appertained to Balaam; but, whence arose this persuasion, unless, <span class="cite-ref">(142)</span> by catching at the more empty name of Prophet, he separates God from Himself? He ought first to have inquired what the will of God was, and to have addressed prayer in earnest faith to Him, in order to propitiate Him; whereas, omitting the main thing, he is satisfied with a mere venal blessing. We gather, therefore, from his anxiety to obtain peace and pardon from God, that there was some seed of religion implanted in his mind. The reverence which he pays to the Prophet is also a sign of his piety. But that he desires to win over God by his own vain inventions is a proof of foolish superstition; and that he seeks to lay Him under obligation to himself, of impious pride. <span class="cite-ref">(143)</span></p><p>I know not how it came into the mind of the Chaldee interpreter to suppose that Pether was on the banks of the Euphrates; nor is it probable that (Balaam) was fetched from so great a distance. Neither would his celebrity have extended from so distant a place to these nations. I am persuaded that it is the proper name of a place, because the termination of the word <em>Petorah </em>does not admit of its being an epithet, such as “the soothsayer,” as Jerome has rendered it. Although, however, the country is not specified, it is probably gathered from the context that Balaam was a Midianite; and for this reason I conceive the Midianites were sought in alliance, in order that they might gain over their fellow-countrymen. </p><p>It is a poor exposition of what follows in verse 7, that they had “the divinations in their hand,” <span class="cite-ref">(144)</span> to refer it to the art of divination, or even that they were accompanied by those who were skillful in the same science. It is more simple to interpret it of their commission, as though Moses said that the messengers were instructed as to what they sought of Balaam, viz., that he should curse the people of Israel, for there is no absurdity in supposing that Moses again repeats what he had related in the preceding verse. Still, I am not indisposed to accept the view which others take, viz., that they took with them the reward or price of divination, for there have been in all ages hireling prophets who made a sale of their revelations; and since even amongst the Israelites many impostors thus set themselves up for hire, this abuse had much vogue (among them.) Hence it was that Saul and his servant hesitated to go to Samuel, because they had not any gift at hand to offer him, until the servant replied that he had the fourth part of a shekel of silver, as if Samuel set up his prophecies for sale, as was commonly the case. (<span class="bvs">1Sa_9:7</span>.) Ezekiel, indeed, charges the false prophets with this, that they sold themselves for a trifling bribe. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(142)</span> “Si ce n’est qu’en prenant a la volee le titre vain de Prophete sans son effet, il separe Dieu de soy-mesme, ou le veust couper par pieces?” unless it be that, laying hold at random of the empty title of Prophet without its essence, he separates God from himself, and would cut him in pieces? — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(143)</span> “D’un orgueil diabolique; “of diabolical arrogance. — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(144)</span><em>A.V. </em>“The rewards of divination;” Ainsworth says, “So Targum Jonathan expoundeth it, <em>The fruits of divination sealed in their hand; </em>and thus <em>Besorah, </em>i.e., <em>good tidings, </em>is used for <em>the reward of good tidings, </em>in <span class="bvs">2Sa_4:10</span>.” “Non raro Hebraei rem ponunt pro pretio rei; ut <span class="bvs">Exo_21:10</span>, <em>humiliatio, </em>i.e., pretium pudicitiae.” — Bonfrerius in Poole. </p></div></div>
