<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them </em>He says, that <em>the glory of the Lord </em><span class="cite-ref">(145)</span><em>shone around </em>the shepherds, by which they perceived him to be an angel. <span class="cite-ref">(146)</span> For it would have been of little avail to be told by an angel what is related by Luke, if God had not testified, by some outward sign, that what they heard proceeded from Him. The angel appeared, not in an ordinary form, or without majesty, but surrounded with the brightness of heavenly glory, to affect powerfully the minds of the shepherds, that they might receive the discourse which was addressed to them, as coming from the mouth of God himself. Hence the <em>fear, </em>of which Luke shortly afterwards speaks, by which God usually humbles the hearts of men, (as I have formerly explained,) and disposes them to receive his word with reverence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(145)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La clarte du Seigneur</span>;” — “the brightness of the Lord.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(146)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">c'a este afin qu'ils cogneussent que c'estoit l'ange de Dieu qui parloit</span>;” — “it was in order that they might know that it was the angel of the Lord that spoke.” </p></div></div>
