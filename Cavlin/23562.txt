<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And he who received the seed among thorns. </em>He places in the third class, those who would have been disposed to receive the seed within, if they had not permitted <em>other things </em>to corrupt and render it degenerate. Christ compares to <em>thorns </em>the pleasures of this life, or wicked desires, and covetousness, and the other anxieties of the flesh. Matthew mentions only <em>the care of this life, </em>along with covetousness, but the meaning is the same; for under that term he includes the allurements of pleasures, which Luke mentions, and every kind of desire. As corn, which otherwise might have been productive, no sooner rises into the stalk than it is choked by thorns and other matters injurious to its growth; so the sinful affections of the flesh prevail over the hearts of men, and overcome faith, and thus destroy the force of the heavenly doctrine, before it has reached maturity. </p><p>Now though sinful desires exert their power on the hearts of men, before the word of the Lord springs up into the blade, yet, at first, their influence is not perceived, and it is only when the corn has grown up, and given promise of fruit, that they gradually make their appearance. Each of us ought to endeavor to tear the <em>thorns </em>out of his heart, if we do not choose that the word of God should be <em>choked; </em>for there is not one of us whose heart is not filled with a vast quantity, and, as I may say, a thick forest, of <em>thorns. </em>And, indeed, we perceive how few there are that reach maturity; for there is scarcely one individual out of ten that labors, I do not say to root out, but even to cut down the <em>thorns. </em>Nay more, the very number of the <em>thorns, </em>which is so prodigious that it ought to shake off our sloth, is the reason why most people give themselves no trouble about them. </p><p><em>The deceitfulness of riches. </em>Christ employs this phrase to denote <em>covetousness </em>He expressly says, that riches are imposing or <em>deceitful, </em>in order that men may be more desirous to guard against falling into their snares. Let us remember that the affections of our flesh, the number and variety of which are incalculable, are so many injurious influences to corrupt <em>the seed </em>of life. </p></div>
