<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>96.</strong><em>In all perfection, I have seen the end. </em><span class="cite-ref">(430)</span> The prophet again, using other words, commends the same truth which he had taught in the first verse of this part — that the word of God is not subject to change, because it is elevated far above the perishable elements of this world. He here asserts, that there is nothing under heaven so perfect and stable, or so complete, in all respects, as not to have an end; and that the Divine word alone possesses such amplitude as to surpass all bounds and limits. Since the verb <span class="lang he-il">כלה</span><em>kalah, </em>signifies <em>to consume and finish, </em>as well as <em>to make perfect, </em>some take the noun <span class="lang he-il">תכלה</span><em>tichelah, </em>for <em>measure </em>or <em>end </em>But it is necessary to translate it <em>perfection, </em>that the comparison may be the more apparent, and the better to amplify the faithfulness of the Divine word; the idea which the prophet intended to convey being, that, after he had considered all things, especially those which are distinguished by the greatest perfection, he found that they were nothing when compared with God’s word, inasmuch as all other things will soon come to an end, whereas the word of God stands ever firm in its own eternity. <span class="cite-ref">(431)</span> Whence it follows, that we have no ground for apprehending that it will forsake us in the midst of our course.. It is termed <em>broad, </em>to denote that, though a man may mount above the heavens, or descend into the lowest depths, or traverse the whole space from the right to the left hand, yet he will not reach farther than the truth of God conducts us. It remains that our minds should embrace this vast extent; and such will be the case when they shall have ceased to enclose and shut themselves up within the narrow limits of this world. </p><p><strong>(430)</strong> “The literal translation is, <em>to the whole of perfection I perceive a limit</em>. The Hebrew word, however, which is rendered by <em>perfection</em>, occurs only in this place. It seems clearly to have for its root a verb signifying <em>to complete</em>, <em>to finish</em>: the meaning is, ‘to every created thing, however perfect, I see a boundary;’ that is, it is limited as to its capability, as well as to its duration.” — <em>Cresswell</em>. </p><p><strong>(431)</strong> “All human things, however full, perfect, and admirable, are necessarily deficient and mutable; but the law of God, like the nature of him from whom it proceeds, endureth for ever, and is in all respects complete and unalterable. We are to understand by the law here, the whole revealed will of God, comprehensive of promise as well as precept.” — <em>Walford</em>. </p></div>
