<div class="comment-content"><p>Then he says first, that <em>his tabernacle had been overthrown by God</em>. They who render it “cottage” extenuate too much what is spoken of; nor does the Prophet simply compare the sanctuary of God to a cottage. Then I take tabernacle in a good sense. With regard to the verb <span class="lang he-il">חמם</span>, <em>chemes</em>, as it means to migrate, they properly render it, as I think, who give this version, that God had removed his tabernacle; nor do I disapprove of repeating the word tabernacle. God, then, had removed his tabernacle, as though it were a cottage in a garden. Watchmen, as it appears from the first chapter of Isaiah, had then cottages in their gardens, but only for a time, as is the case at this day with those who watch over their vineyards; they have, until the time of vintage, small chests in which they conceal themselves. The Prophet then says, that though God’s tabernacle was honorable, and of high dignity, it was yet like a cottage in a garden. It is not, however, a simple comparison, as before stated, and therefore I reject the opinion of those who render it cottage, for it is not suitable, and it would be unmeaning. <em>God</em>, then, <em>hath removed his tabernacle as a garden</em>, that is, the sanctuary where he dwelt. And how did he remove it? even as a garden-cottage. And as watchers of gardens were wont to construct their little cots of leaves of trees and slight materials, so the Prophet, in order to increase commiseration, says, that the sacred habitation of God was like a cottage in a garden, because it was removed from one place to another; and thus he intimates that God regarded as nothing what he had previously adorned with singular excellencies. <span class="cite-ref">(151)</span></p><p>He then adds, that God had <em>destroyed his testimony</em>. By the word, <span class="lang he-il">מועד</span>, <em>muod</em>, he means the same throughout; but some confine it to the ark of the covenant, and of this I do not disapprove. We must yet bear in mind the design of the Prophet, which was to shew that by the entire ruin of the Temple the covenant of God was in a manner abolished. It is, indeed, certain, that God had not forgotten his faithfulness and constancy, but this abolition of his covenant refers to what appeared to men. He then says, that the sanctuary which was, as it were, the testimony of God’s favor, had been overthrown. Now, as he repeats again the word <span class="lang he-il">מועד</span>, <em>muod</em>, it may be that he thus refers to the Tabernacle, either because the holy assemblies met there, or because it had been solemnly dedicated, that God might there hold intercourse with his people. For <span class="lang he-il">מועד</span>, <em>muod</em>, means a fixed time, it means an assembly, it means a festival, and sometimes it means a sacrifice; and all these signification’s are not unsuitable: yet when he says that God had <em>destroyed his testimony</em>, I apply this to the Tabernacle itself, or, if it seems to any preferable, to the ark of the covenant; though the former is the most suitable, because it was a place consecrated, as it has been stated, for mutual intercourse. </p><p>He afterwards says, that God had <em>forgotten the assembly</em>, the sacrifice, or the tabernacle; for it is the same word again, but it seems not to be taken in the same sense. Then I think that <span class="lang he-il">מועד</span>, <em>muod</em>, is to be taken here for the assembly. As he had previously said, that the place where the holy assemblies met had been overthrown or destroyed, so now he says, that God had no care for all those assemblies, as though they had been buried in perpetual oblivion; for he mentions also the <em>Sabbath</em>, which corresponds with the subject. God, then, had forgotten all the assemblies as well as the Sabbath. There is, again, as to this last word, a part stated for the whole, for this word was no doubt intended to include all the festivals. The meaning of the passage then is, that the impiety of the people had been so great, that God, having, as it were, forgotten his covenant, had inflicted such a dreadful punishment, that religion, for a time, was in a manner trodden under foot. </p><p>He says, in the last place, that the <em>king and the priest </em>had been rejected by God. We have already said, that these were as two pledges of God’s paternal favor; for, on the one hand, he who reigned from the posterity of David was a living image of Christ; and on the other hand, there was always a high-priest from the posterity of Aaron to reconcile men to God. It was then the same as though God shewed himself in every way propitious to the chosen people. Then their true happiness was founded on the kingdom and the priesthood; for the kingdom was, as it were, a mark of God’s favor for their defense, and the priesthood was to them the means by which reconciliation with God was obtained. When, therefore, God wholly disregarded the king and the priest, it became hence evident, that he was greatly displeased with his people, having thus, in a manner, obliterated his favors. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(151)</strong> The word <span class="lang he-il">שכו</span> is rendered by the versions in the sense of <span class="lang he-il">סכו</span>, “his tabernacle;” but by so doing they make it the same in effect with <span class="lang he-il">מועדו</span>, “his place of meeting,” in the following clause. The verb <span class="lang he-il">חמס</span> never means what <em>Calvin </em>says, to migrate or to remove, but to cast off, or to throw down, that is, with force or violence. Then <span class="lang he-il">שר</span>, a fence or enclosure, is what suits the verb, — </p><p>  </p><p><strong>6.</strong>And he has thrown down as that of a garden his enclosure, <LineBreak />He has destroyed his assembling-place; Forgotten hath Jehovah in Sion the assembly and the Sabbath; And has cast off, in the foaming of his wrath, the king and the priest. </p><p>The “enclosure,” or fence, refers to the courts which surrounded the Temple; hence the place where the people assembled was destroyed. God had regarded it no more than the fence of a common garden. There is “fence” understood after <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>, no uncommon thing in Hebrew. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
