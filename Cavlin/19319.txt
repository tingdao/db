<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah proceeds with the same subject. He said yesterday that the people were no longer cared for by God, and so that nothing remained for them but in various ways to perish, and that the last punishment would be exile. He now confirms the same thing, and says, that God would prepare against them ravenous birds as well as wild beasts, the sword and dogs <span class="cite-ref">(129)</span> as though he had said, that all animals would be hostile to them, and be the executioners of God’s vengeance. </p><p>Some render the verb <span class="lang he-il">פקד</span>,<em>pekod, </em>to visit, but improperly, as I think; for they must give this version, “I will visit four families upon them;” but there is no sense in this, nor can any sense be elicited from it. The meaning most suitable here is to set over, <span class="cite-ref">(130)</span> “I will set over them four kinds;” which he calls “four families.” And there is to be understood here a contrast: as they thought it hard to obey God, they were now to have over them dogs and wild beasts, and the birds of the air, and the sword. The meaning is, that there would be no end to God’s vengeance, and to various punishments, until the Jews were wholly destroyed. He further intimates, that he would have in readiness many to execute his wrath, as he had all creatures under his control. As then he would employ in his service dogs, and birds, and animals, as well as men, it behoved the Jews to feel assured that they in vain had recourse to this or that refuge. We indeed know that men impiously confine the power of God, both with regard to their salvation and the punishment of their sins, for when he passes by any evil they think that they have escaped, and promise themselves impunity, as though God indeed were not able every moment to inflict many and various scourges. This then is the reason why the Prophet speaks here of four kinds of judgments. It follows — </p><p><strong>(129)</strong> Our version ascribes tearing to dogs, but the verb means to draw or drag about, as rendered by <em>Calvin</em>. It is more descriptive of what is done by dogs, and conveys a more horrid idea, and intended doubtless to terrify the Jews. <em>Blayney </em>renders it “to drag about,” and no doubt correctly. Our version is the <em>Vulgate</em>: the <em>Syriac </em>is to draw or drag about. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(130)</strong> So Gataker, “I will set over them, etc., as in <span class="bvs">Lev_26:16</span>; a borrowed speech from officers set over people.” The <em>Syriac </em>expresses the idea, “I will punish them with four scourges.” <em>Blayney’s </em>version is — </p><p>And I will commission against them four species. </p><p>But the best rendering is that of <em>Calvin</em>, which is also adopted by <em>Venema</em>. I give the following version — </p><p>And I set over them four kinds, saith Jehovah, — The sword to kill, and dogs to drag about, And the bird of heaven and the beast of the earth To devour, and to pull to pieces. </p><p>The “devouring” refers to “the beast of the earth,” and the “pulling to pieces” to the bird of heaven, according to the usual style of the Prophets, the order being reversed. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
