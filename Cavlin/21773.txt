<div class="comment-content"><p>Nebuchadnezzar had often heard of Daniel, and had been compelled to admire the dexterity of his genius, and the singular gift of his wisdom. <em>How </em>comes it, then, that he passed him by when he had need of his singular skill? Although the king anxiously inquires concerning the dream, yet we observe he does not act seriously; since it would doubtless have come into his mind, “Behold, thou hadst formerly beheld in the captives of Judah the incredible gift of celestial wisdom — -then, in the first place, send for them!” Here the king’s sloth is detected because he did not send for Daniel among the rest. We have stated this to be governed by the secret providence of God, who was unwilling that his servant should mix with those ministers of Satan, whose whole knowledge consisted in juggling and errors. We now see how the king had neglected the gift of God, and had stifled the light offered to him; but Daniel is next dragged to death. Therefore, I said, that tyrants are, for this reason, very unjust, and exercise a cruel violence because they will not undertake the labor and trouble of inquiry. Meanwhile we see that God wonderfully snatches his own people from the jaws of death, as it happened in Daniel’s case; for we may be surprised at Arioch sparing his life when he slew the others who were natives. How can we account for Daniel meeting with more humanity than the Chaldeans, though he was a foreigner and a captive? Because his life was in the hand and keeping of God, who restrained both the mind and the hand of the prefect from being immediately savage with him. But it is said — Daniel <em>inquired concerning the counsel and the edict </em>Some translate <em>prudently </em>and <em>cunningly </em>and <span class="lang he-il">עטא</span>, <em>gneta, </em>signifies “<em>prudence, </em>” just as <span class="lang he-il">טעם</span><em>, tegem, </em>metaphorically is received for “<em>intelli </em>gence” when it signifies taste. <span class="cite-ref">(126)</span> But we shall afterwards find this latter word used for an edict, and because this sense appears to suit better, I therefore adopt it, as Daniel had inquired of the prefect the meaning of the edict and the king’s design. Arioch also is called the Prince of Satellites. Some translate it of executioners, and others of cooks, for <span class="lang he-il">טבח</span>, <em>tebech, </em>signifies “<em>to </em>slay,” but the noun deduced from this means a cook. Thus Potiphar is called, to whom Joseph was sold. (<span class="bvs">Gen_39:1</span>.) It seems to me a. kind of absurdity to call him the prince of gaolers; and if we say the prefect of cooks, it is equally unsuitable to his office of being sent to slay the Chaldeans. I therefore prefer interpreting it more mildly, supposing him to be the prefect of the guards; for, as I have said, Potiphar is called <span class="lang he-il">רב טבחים</span><em>, reb tebechi, </em>and here the pronunciation only is changed. It follows: </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(126)</span> So translated in Auth.
