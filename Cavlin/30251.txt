<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>We have an altar, etc. </em>This is a beautiful adaptation of an old rite under the Law, to the present state of the Church. There was a kind of sacrifice appointed, mentioned in the sixteenth chapter of Leviticus, no part of which returned to the priests and Levites. This, as he now shows by a suitable allusion, was accomplished in Christ; for he was sacrificed on this condition, that they who serve the tabernacle should not feed on him. But by the <em>ministers of the tabernacle </em>he means all those who performed the ceremonies. Then that we may partake of Christ, he intimates that we must renounce the tabernacle; for as the word <em>altar </em>includes sacrificing and the victim; so <em>tabernacle, </em>all the external types connected with it. </p><p>Then the meaning is, “No wonder if the rites of the Law have now ceased, for this is what was typified by the sacrifice which the Levites brought without the camp to be there burnt; for as the ministers of the tabernacle did eat nothing of it, so if we serve the tabernacle, that is, retain its ceremonies, we shall not be partakers of that sacrifice which Christ once offered, nor of the expiation which he once made by his own blood; for his own blood he brought into the heavenly sanctuary that he might atone for the sin of the world.” <span class="cite-ref">(284)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(284)</span> The verb<span class="lang el-gr">ἁγιάζω </span> means here expiation, as in <span class="bvs">Heb_2:11</span>, and other places in this Epistle; and so it is taken by Calvin and the rendering of Stuart is “that he might make expiation,” etc. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
