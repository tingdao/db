<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Ye know the house of Stephanas </em>We know, from daily experience, of what advantage it is, that those should have the highest authority, whom God has adorned with the most distinguished gifts. Accordingly, if we wish to secure the welfare of the Church, let us always take care that honor be conferred upon the good: let their counsels have the greatest weight; let others give way to them, and allow themselves to be governed by their prudence. This Paul does in this instance, when admonishing the Corinthians to show respect to the <em>house of Stephanas. </em>Some manuscripts add, <em>and Fortunatus. </em><span class="cite-ref">(170)</span> For God manifests himself to us when he shows us the gifts of his Spirit. Hence, if we would not appear to be despisers of God, let us voluntarily <em>submit ourselves </em>to those, on whom God has conferred superior gifts. </p><p>Now, that they may be the more inclined to put honor upon <em>that house, </em>(for as to the other, it appears to me to be, in this place at least, a spurious addition,) he reminds them that they were the <em>first-fruits of Achaia, </em>that is, that the household of Stephanas were the first that had embraced the gospel. Not indeed as though the first in order of time were in every case superior to the others, but where there is perseverance along with this, it is with good reason, that honor is conferred upon those, who have in a manner paved the way for the gospel by promptitude of faith. It must be observed, however, that he dignifies with this honorable title those, who had consecrated to believers their services and resources. For the same reason, he bestows commendation a little afterwards upon Fortunatus and Achaicus, that, in proportion to a man’s superiority of excellence, <span class="cite-ref">(171)</span> he might be held so much the more in esteem, that he might be able to do the more good. Farther, in order that the Corinthians may be the more disposed to love them, he says, that <em>what had been wanting </em>on the part of their entire Church <em>had been compensated for </em>by their vicarious services. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(170)</span> The Alex. and Copt. MSS. <em>read </em>— <em>and Fortunatus. </em>The Vulgate <em>reads </em>— <em>Fortunatum et Achaicum </em><em>; </em>in accordance with which the rendering in Wiclif (1380) is, <em>Ye knowen the hous of stephart and of fortunati, and acacie. </em>The Rheims version (1582) reads — You <em>know the house of Ste-phanas and of Fortunatus. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(171)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Selon que chacun estoit plus homme de bien et vertueux</span>;” — “In proportion as an individual was an honorable and virtuous man.” </p></div></div>
