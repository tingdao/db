<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>44.</strong><em>When he turned their rivers into blood. </em>The Psalmist does not enumerate in their order the miracles by which God gave evidence of his power in the deliverance of his people. He considered it enough to bring to their remembrance the well-known histories of these events, which would be sufficient to lay open the wickedness and ingratitude with which they were chargeable; nor is it necessary for us to stay long on these things, since the narrative of Moses gives a more distinct and fuller account of what is here briefly stated. Only I would have my readers to remember that, although God often punished the sins of the heathen by sending upon them hail and other calamities, yet all the plagues which at that time were inflicted upon the Egyptians were of an extraordinary character, and such as were previously unheard-of. A variety of words is therefore employed to enhance these memorable instances of the vengeance of God, as that <em>he sent upon them the fierceness of his wrath, fury, anger, and affliction </em>This accumulation of words is intended to awaken minds which are asleep to a discovery of so many miracles, of which both the number and the excellence might be perceived even by the blind themselves. </p><p>In the last place, it is added that God executed these judgments <em>by angels. </em>Although God has, according as it has pleased him, established certain laws, both in heaven and on earth, and governs the whole order of nature in such a manner as that each creature has assigned to it its own peculiar office; yet whenever it seems good to him he makes use of the ministration of angels for executing his commands, not by ordinary or natural means, but by his secret power, which to us is incomprehensible. Some think that devils are here spoken of, because the epithet <em>evil </em>or <em>hurtful </em>is applied to <em>angel. </em><span class="cite-ref">(351)</span> This opinion I do not reject; but the ground upon which they rest it has little solidity. They say that as God dispenses his benefits to us by the ministry of elect angels, so he also executes his wrath by the agency of reprobate angels, as if they were his executioners. This I admit is partly true; but I deny that this distinction is always observed. Many passages of Scripture can be quoted to the contrary. When the army of the Assyrians laid siege to the holy city Jerusalem, who was it that made such havoc among them as compelled them to raise the siege, but the angel who was appointed at that time for the defense of the Church? (<span class="bvs">2Kg_19:35</span>.) In like manner, the angel who slew the first-born in Egypt (<span class="bvs">Exo_11:5</span>) was not only a minister and an executor of the wrath of God against the Egyptians, but also the agent employed for preserving the Israelites. On the other hand, although the kings of whom Daniel speaks were avaricious and cruel, or rather robbers, and turned all things upside down, yet the Prophet declares, (chapter 20:13,) that holy angels were appointed to take charge of them. It is probable that the Egyptians were given over and subjected to reprobate angels, as they deserved; but we may simply consider the angels here spoken of as termed <em>evil, </em>on account of the work in which they were employed, — because they inflicted upon the enemies of the people of God terrible plagues to repress their tyranny and cruelty. In this way, both the heavenly and elect angels, and the fallen angels, are justly accounted the ministers or executors of calamity; but they are to be regarded as such in different senses. The former yield a prompt and willing obedience to God; but the latter, as they are always eagerly intent upon doing mischief, and would, if they could, turn the whole world upside down, are fit instruments for inflicting calamities upon men. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(351)</span> Aben Ezra supposes <span class="lang he-il">מלאכי רעים</span>, <em>malachey raim</em>, to be Moses and Aaron, as <em>messengers of evil </em>to Pharaoh, who are so called because they previously warned him, and denounced the judgments of God against him, just as the Prophet Abijah makes use of a similar expression when the wife of Jeroboam came to him to inquire concerning her son: “I am a messenger to thee of hard things,” <span class="bvs">1Kg_14:6</span>. Fry also reads “messengers of evil,” and has the following note: “Such is the literal meaning and exact rendering of <span class="lang he-il">מלאכי רעים</span>, and not <em>evil angels</em>, which would be regularly <span class="lang he-il">מלאכים רעים</span>. By these <em>messengers of evil</em>, I make no doubt, no more is meant than Moses and Aaron, who were charged with denunciations of wrath to Pharaoh, previously to the infliction of all the several plagues.” Archbishop Secker, however, observes, that although <span class="lang he-il">מלאכים רעים</span> would be the proper expression for <em>evil angels</em>, yet the plural of <span class="lang he-il">לאכ</span> is sometimes written defectively <span class="lang he-il">מלאכי</span>. The LXX. has, <span class="lang el-gr">ἀποστολὢν δἰ ἀγγελων πονηρῶν</span>, “a message by evil angels.” </p></div></div>
