<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>For as the body is one </em>He now derives a similitude from the human body, which he makes use of also in <span class="bvs">Rom_12:4</span>; but it is for a different purpose, as I have already stated above. In that passage, he exhorts every one to be satisfied with his own calling, and not to invade another’s territory; as ambition, curiosity, or some other disposition, induces many to take in hand more than is expedient. Here, however, he exhorts believers to cleave to each other in a mutual distribution of gifts, as they were not conferred upon them by God that every one should enjoy his own separately, but that one should help another. It is usual, however, for any society of men, or congregation, to be called a <em>body, </em>as one city constitutes a <em>body, </em>and so, in like manner, one senate, and one people. Monenius Agrippa, <span class="cite-ref">(747)</span> too, in ancient times, when desirous to conciliate the Roman people, when at variance with the senate, made use of an apologue, not very unlike the doctrine of Paul here. <span class="cite-ref">(748)</span> Among Christians, however, the case is very different; for they do not constitute a mere political body, but are the spiritual and mystical body of Christ, as Paul himself afterwards adds. (<span class="bvs">1Co_12:27</span>.) The meaning therefore <em>is </em>— “Though the members of the body are various, and have different functions, they are, nevertheless, linked together in such a manner that they coalesce in one. <span class="cite-ref">(749)</span> We, accordingly, who are members of Christ, although we are endowed with various gifts, ought, notwithstanding, to have an eye to that connection which we have in Christ.” </p><p><em>So also is Christ </em>The name of Christ is used here instead of the Church, because the similitude was intended to apply not to God’s only-begotten Son, but to us. It is a passage that is full of choice consolation, inasmuch as he calls the Church <em>Christ; </em>for Christ <span class="cite-ref">(750)</span> confers upon us this honor — that he is willing to be esteemed and recognised, not in himself merely, but also in his members. Hence the same Apostle says elsewhere, (<span class="bvs">Eph_1:23</span>,) that the Church is his <em>completion, </em><span class="cite-ref">(751)</span> as though he would, if separated from his members, be incomplete. And certainly, as Augustine elegantly expresses himself in one part of his writings — </p><p>“Since we are <em>in </em>Christ a fruit-bearing vine, what are we <em>out of </em>him but dry twigs?” (<span class="bvs">Joh_15:4</span>.) </p><p>In this, then, our consolation lies — that, as he and the Father are one, so we are one with him. Hence it is that his name is applied to us. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(747)</span> Menenius Agrippa, a Roman consul, on occasion of a rebellion breaking out among the common people against the nobles and senators, whom they represented as useless and cumbersome to the state, was successful in quelling the insurrection, by a happy use of the apologue referred to, founded on the intimate connection and mutual dependence of the different parts of the body. The reader will find this interesting incident related by <em>Livy</em>, Book 2. chapter 32. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(748)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En remonstrant que les membres du corps ayans conspire contre le ventre, et se voulans separer d’auec luy s’en trouuerent mal les premiers</span>;” — “By showing that the members of the body, having conspired against the belly, and wishing to separate from it, were the first to experience the bad effects of this.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(749)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils prenent nourriture et accroissement l’un auec l’autre</span>;” — “They take nourishment and increase, one with another.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(750)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce bon Seigneur Iesus</span>;” — “This good Lord Jesus.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(751)</span> Calvin, along with some other interpreters, understands the term, <span class="lang el-gr">πλήρωμα</span>, (<em>fullness</em>,) in the passage referred to, in an <em>active </em>sense. <em>Theophylact </em>observes that the Church is the <span class="lang el-gr">Πλήρωμα</span> — <em>completion </em>of Christ, as the body and limbs are of the head. The term may, however, be taken in a <em>passive </em>sense, as meaning <em>a thing to be filled or completed</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
