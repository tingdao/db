<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Love in the Spirit </em>I take to mean, <em>spiritual love</em>, according to the view of Chrysostom, with whom, however, I do not agree in the interpretation of the preceding words. Now, <em>spiritual love </em>is of such a nature as has no view to the world, but is consecrated to the service of piety, <span class="cite-ref">(286)</span> and has, as it were, an internal root, while carnal friendships depend on external causes. </p><p><strong>(286)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais est commencee et comme consacree a l’adueu de la piete et cognoissance de Dieu</span>;” — “But is commenced and, as it were, consecrated to the service of piety and the knowledge of God.” </p></div>
