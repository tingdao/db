<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>Else what shall they do </em>He resumes his enumeration of the absurdities, which follow from the error under which the Corinthians labored. He had set himself in the outset to do this, but he introduced instruction and consolation, by means of which he interrupted in some degree the thread of his discourse. To this he now returns. In the first place he brings forward this objection — that the baptism which those received who are already regarded as dead, will be of no avail if there is no resurrection. Before expounding this passage, it is of importance to set aside the common exposition, which rests upon the authority of the ancients, and is received with almost universal consent. Chrysostom, therefore, and Ambrose, who are followed by others, are of opinion <span class="cite-ref">(63)</span> that the Corinthians were accustomed, when any one had been deprived of baptism by sudden death, to substitute some living person in the place of the deceased — to be baptized at his grave. They at the same time do not deny that this custom was corrupt, and full of superstition, but they say that Paul, for the purpose of confuting the Corinthians, was contented with this single fact, <span class="cite-ref">(64)</span> that while they denied that there was a resurrection, they in the mean time declared in this way that they believed in it. For my part, however, I cannot by any means be persuaded to believe this, <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span> for it is not to be credited, that those who denied that there was a resurrection had, along with others, made use of a custom of this sort. Paul then would have had immediately this reply made to him: “Why do you trouble us with that old wives’ superstition, which you do not yourself approve of?” Farther, if they had made use of it, they might very readily have replied: “If this has been hitherto practiced by us through mistake, rather let the mistake be corrected, than that it should have weight attached to it for proving a point of such importance.” </p><p>Granting, however, that the argument was conclusive, can we suppose that, if such a corruption as this had prevailed among the Corinthians, the Apostle, after reproving almost all their faults, would have been silent as to this one? He has censured above some practices that are not of so great moment. He has not scrupled to give directions as to women’s having the head covered, and other things of that nature. Their corrupt administration of the Supper he has not merely reproved, but has inveighed against it with the greatest keenness. Would he in the meantime have uttered not a single word in reference to such a base profanation of baptism, which was a much more grievous fault? He has inveighed with great vehemence against those who, by frequenting the banquets of the Gentiles, silently countenanced their superstitions. Would he have suffered this horrible superstition of the Gentiles to be openly carried on in the Church itself under the name of sacred baptism? But granting that he might have been silent, what shall we say when he expressly makes mention of it? Is it, I pray you, a likely thing that the Apostle would bring forward in the shape of an argument a sacrilege <span class="cite-ref">(66)</span> by which baptism was polluted, and converted into a mere magical abuse, and yet not say even one word in condemnation of the fault? When he is treating of matters that are not of the highest importance, he introduces nevertheless this parenthesis, that he <em>speaks as a man. </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_3:5</span>; <span class="bvs">Rom_6:19</span>; <span class="bvs">Gal_3:15</span>.) Would not this have been a more befitting and suitable place for such a parenthesis? Now from his making mention of such a thing without any word of reproof, who would not understand it to be a thing that was allowed? For my part, I assuredly understand him to speak here of the right use of baptism, and not of an abuse of it of that nature. </p><p>Let us now inquire as to the meaning. At one time I was of opinion, that Paul here pointed out the universal design of baptism, for the advantage of baptism is not confined to this life; but on considering the words afterwards with greater care, I perceived that Paul here points out something peculiar. For he does not speak of all when he says, <em>What shall they do, who are baptized </em>? <em>etc. </em>Besides, I am not fond of interpretations, that are more ingenious than solid. What then? I say, that those are <em>baptized for dead, </em>who are looked upon as already dead, and who have altogether despaired of life; and in this way the particle <span class="lang el-gr">ὑπέρ</span> will have the force of the Latin <em>pro </em><em>, </em>as when we say, <em>habere pro derelicto </em><em>; </em>— <em>to reckon as abandoned </em><span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> This signification is not a forced one. Or if you would prefer another signification, to be <em>baptized for the dead </em>will mean — to be baptized so as to profit the dead — not the living, <span class="cite-ref">(68)</span> Now it is well known, that from the very commencement of the Church, those who had, while yet catechumens, <span class="cite-ref">(69)</span> fallen into disease, <span class="cite-ref">(70)</span> if their life was manifestly in danger, were accustomed to ask baptism, that they might not leave this world before they had made a profession of Christianity; and this, in order that they might carry with them the seal of their salvation. </p><p>It appears from the writings of the Fathers, that as to this matter, also, there crept in afterwards a superstition, for they inveigh against those who delayed baptism till the time of their death, that, being once for all purged from all their sins, they might in this state meet the judgment of God. <span class="cite-ref">(71)</span> A gross error truly, which proceeded partly from great ignorance, and partly from hypocrisy! Paul, however, here simply mentions a custom that was sacred, and in accordance with the Divine institution — that if a catechumen, who had already in his heart embraced the Christian faith, <span class="cite-ref">(72)</span> saw that death was impending over him, he asked baptism, partly for his own consolation, and partly with a view to the edification of his brethren. For it is no small <em>consolation to </em>carry the token of his salvation sealed in his body. There is also an <em>edification, </em>not to be lost sight of — that of making a confession of his faith. They were, then, <em>baptized for the dead, </em>inasmuch as it could not be of any service to them in this world, and the very occasion of their asking baptism was that they despaired of life. We now see that it is not without good reason that Paul asks, <em>what they would do </em>if there remained no hope after death? <span class="cite-ref">(73)</span> This passage shows us, too, that those impostors who had disturbed the faith of the Corinthians, had contrived a figurative resurrection, making the farthest goal of believers to be in this world, His repeating it a second time, <em>Why are they also baptized for the dead? </em>gives it greater emphasis: “Not only are those baptized who think that they are to live longer, but those too who have death before their eyes; and that, in order that they may in death reap the fruit of their baptism.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(63)</span> “This,” it is stated by <em>Barnes, </em>“was the opinion of Grotius, Michaelis, Tertullian, and Ambrose.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(64)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De ce seul argument</span>;” — “With this single argument.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(65)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mats ie ne voy rien qui me puisse amener a suyure ceste coniecture</span>;” — “But I see nothing that could induce me to follow that conjecture.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(66)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce sacrilege horrible</span>;<em>” </em>— <em>“ </em>This horrible sacrilege.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(67)</span> The form of expression referred to is made use of by Cicero.

Men lived in sin as long as they thought they could safely, and deferred baptism till their near approach to death, under a groundless hope of washing away all their guilt at once.” See also Turretine’s Theology, (Geneva, 1690,) volume 3 — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(72)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si celuy qui n’ estoit pas encore parfaitement instruit en la doctrine Chrestienne, et toutesfois auoit desia de vraye affection embrasse la foy</span>;” — “If one, that had not as yet been fully instructed in Christian doctrine, but yet had already embraced the faith with true affection.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(73)</span> “Baptism,” says Dr. Dick, in his Lectures on Theology, (volume 4) “imports our interest in the resurrection of Christ and its consequences. It was called by the ancients ‘the earnest of good things to come,’ and ‘the type of the future resurrection.’ May not this be the meaning of that passage in the fifteenth chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, concerning which there has been such a diversity of opinion? ‘Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? why are they then baptized for the dead?’ (<span class="bvs">1Co_15:29</span>.) Some of the Fathers understood the expression, <span class="lang el-gr">ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>, to mean to be baptized <em>into the hope of the resurrection of the dead; </em>or, what amounts to the same thing, to submit to baptism that they might fill up the places of those who had died, thus declaring their belief that they had not perished, but were alive in a better world, and their hope that, through Jesus Christ, to whom they dedicated themselves in baptism, they also should be raised again to enjoy the same glorious recompense. According to this view of the passage, a resurrection to life is one of the blessings signified and sealed by this institution. It assures us of a triumph over death and the grave, through the redeeming blood of Christ, with which we are sprinkled; and of admission into heaven, for which we are qualified by the washing of <em>regeneration.” </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
