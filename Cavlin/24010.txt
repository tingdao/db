<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_25:1</span><strong>.</strong><em>Then shall the kingdom of heaven. </em>By this term is meant the condition of the future Church, which was to be collected by the authority and direction of Christ. He employs this remarkable title, that believers may not deceive themselves by an erroneous opinion that they have arrived at absolute perfection. The parable is borrowed from the ordinary custom of life; for it was a childish speculation of <em>Jerome </em>and others, to adduce this passage in praise of <em>virginity; </em>while Christ had no other object in view than to lessen the uneasiness which they might be apt to feel in consequence of the delay of his coming. He says, therefore, that he asks nothing more from us than is usually done for friends at a marriage-feast. The custom was, that <em>virgins, </em>who are tender and delicateâ€”should, by way of respect, accompany <em>the bridegroom </em>to his chamber. But the general instruction of the parable consists in this, that it is not enough to have been once ready and prepared for the discharge of duty, if we do not persevere to the end. </p></div>
