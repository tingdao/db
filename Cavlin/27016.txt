<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>That when </em>If we follow Erasmus and the old interpreter, this sentence shall be unperfect, <span class="cite-ref">(185)</span> which may be made perfect, thus: <em>When the time of refreshing shall come, you may also enjoy this refreshing; </em>when Christ shall come to judge the world, you may find him a redeemer and not a Judge. But because Beza doth fitly translate it, <em>After that they shall come, </em>it is better to retain that which is not so racked; <span class="cite-ref">(186)</span> so you resolve it thus: That sins are so forgiven against the day of the last judgment; because, unless we be cited to appear before God’s judgment-seat we are not greatly careful to pacify God. First of all, we must note, that he setteth before them the day of judgment, to the end the former exhortation may take the greater effect. For there is nothing which doth more prick us, than when we are taught that we must once give an account. For so long as our senses are holden and kept in this world, they are drowned, as it were, in a certain drowsiness, <span class="cite-ref">(187)</span> that I may so call it. Wherefore the message of the last judgment must sound as a trumpet to <em>cite </em>us to appear before the judgment-seat of God. For then at last being truly awaked, we begin to think of a new life. In like sort, when Paul preached at Athens, God saith, that he doth now will all men to repent; because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world, (<span class="bvs">Act_17:30</span>.) The sum is this, that Christ, who is now unto us a Master, when as he teacheth us by the gospel, is appointed of the Father to be a Judge, and shall come in his due time; and that, therefore, we must obey his doctrine betimes, that we may gather the fruit of our faith then. </p><p>But some man may object, that Peter speaketh otherwise of the last day. For this doth not serve to make them afraid, when he saith, <em>the time of refreshing. </em>I answer, that there is a double prick, wherewith the faithful are pricked forward when as they are told of the last judgment. For the profit of faith doth not appear in this world, yea rather it seemeth to go well with the despisers of God; but the life of the godly is full of miseries. Therefore our hearts should oftentimes faint and quail, unless we should remember that the day of rest shall come, which shall quench all the heat of our trouble, and make an end of our miseries. The other prick whereof I spoke is this, when as the fearful judgment of God causeth us to shake off delicacy and drowsiness. So Peter mixeth in this place threatenings with promises, partly to the end he may allure the Jews unto Christ, and partly that he may prick them forward with fear. Furthermore, this is a thing much used in the Scripture, as it speaketh either unto the reprobate, or unto the elect, sometimes to make the day of the Lord doleful and fearful, sometimes to make the same pleasant and to be wished for. Peter therefore doth very well, who, whilst that he putteth the Jews in good hope of pardon, doth make the day of Christ pleasant to them, to the end they may desire the same. </p><p><em>And shall send him. </em>He saith expressly that Christ shall be Judge, to the end they may know that the contempt of the gospel shall not be unpunished. For how should not Christ punish the same? In the meanwhile, this doth greatly comfort the faithful, when as they know that it shall be in his hand to give salvation, who doth now promise and offer the same. He addeth, moreover, that he shall come who is now preached unto them. Whereby he taketh away all excuse of ignorance. As if he should say, Christ is preached unto you now before he come to judge the world; to the end that those who will embrace him may receive the fruit of their faith at that day; and to the end that others, who shall refuse him, may be punished for their unbelief. Although the Grecians do read this two ways; for some books <span class="cite-ref">(188)</span> have <span class="lang el-gr">προκεκηρυγμενον</span>, that is, <em>preached before; </em>and other some <span class="lang el-gr">προκεχειρισμενον</span>, that is, <em>showed, or set before their eyes. </em>But both have one sense, to wit, that Christ is not offered unto them in vain now by the doctrine of the gospel; because he shall be sent the second time by his Father to be a Judge, armed and prepared to render vengeance, unless they embrace him now for their Redeemer. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(185)</span> “Ecliptica,” elliptic. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(186)</span> “Coactum,” forced. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(187)</span> “Quodam, ut ita loquar veterno obruti sunt,” are oppressed, so to speak, with a kind of lethargy. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(188)</span> “Codices,” manuscripts. </p></div></div>
