He again calls the Corinthians to unity, by reminding them that all have derived from one fountain whatever they possess, while he instructs them, at the same time, that no one has so much as to have enough within himself, so as not to require help from others. For this is what he means by these words —<em>distributing to every one severally as he willeth </em>The Spirit of God, therefore, distributes them among us, in order that we may make all contribute to the common advantage. To no one does he give all, lest any one, satisfied with his particular portion, should separate himself from others, and live solely for himself. The same idea is intended in the adverb <em>severally, </em>as it is of great importance to understand accurately that diversity by which God unites us mutually to one another. <span class="cite-ref">(746)</span> Now, when <em>will </em>is ascribed to the Spirit, and that, too, in connection with power, we may conclude from this, that the Spirit is truly and properly God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(746)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par laquelle Dieu nou conioint et oblige mutuellement les uns aux autres</span>;” — “By which God connects and binds us mutually to one another.” </p></div></div>
