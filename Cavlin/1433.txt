<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And Joseph nourished his father, etc., according to their families </em><span class="cite-ref">(185)</span> Some explain the expression, “the mouth of the little one,” as if Joseph nourished his father and his whole family, in the manner in which food is conveyed to the mouths of children. These interpreters regard the form of speech as emphatical, because, during the famine, Jacob and his family had no more anxiety about the providing of food than children, who cannot even stretch out their hand to receive it. Others translate it “youth,” but I know not with what meaning. <span class="cite-ref">(186)</span> Others take it, simply, according to the proportion and number of the little children. To me the genuine sense seems to be that he fed all, from the greatest to the least. Therefore, there was sufficient bread for the whole family of Jacob, because, by the care of Joseph, provision was made to supply nourishment even to the little ones. In this manner Moses commemorates both the clemency of God, and the piety of Joseph; for it was an instance of uncommon attention, that these hungry husband men, who had not a grain of corn, were entirely fed at his expense. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(185)</span>Usque ad os parvuli Even to the mount of the little one. <span class="lang he-il">לפי חטÃ</span>, (<em>Lephi chataph</em>.) </p><p><span class="cite-note">(186)</span>Alii vertunt pubem; sed nescio quo sensu. </p></div></div>
