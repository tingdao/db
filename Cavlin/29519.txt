<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Not the things that are on earth. </em>He does not mean, as he does a little afterwards, depraved appetites, which reign in earthly men, nor even riches, or fields, or houses, nor any other things of the present life, which we must </p><p>use, as though we did not use them,<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_7:30</span>) <span class="cite-ref">(433)</span></p><p>but is still following out his discussion as to ceremonies, which he represents as resembling entanglements which constrain us to creep upon the ground. “Christ,” says he, “calls us upwards to himself, while these draw us downwards.” For this is the winding-up and exposition of what he had lately touched upon as to the abolition of ceremonies through the death of Christ. “The ceremonies are dead to you through the death of Christ, and you to them, in order that, being raised up to heaven with Christ, you may think only of those things that are above. Leave off therefore earthly things.” I shall not contend against others who are of a different mind; but certainly the Apostle appears to me to go on step by step, so that, in the first instance, he places traditions as to trivial matters in contrast with meditation on the heavenly life, and afterwards, as we shall see, goes a step farther. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(433)</span> See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 257. </p></div></div>
