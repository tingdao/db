<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>But Jehovah of hosts shall be exalted in judgment. </em>He expresses the manner, or, as it is commonly called, the formal cause, of the excellence of which he has spoken; as if he had said, “The God of hosts, whom ungodly men insolently tread under their feet, will be raised on high, when he shall show himself to be the judge of the world.” In this manner he ridicules the foolish confidence with which the ungodly vaunted; for if judgment and righteousness must at length come forth, it follows that they shall be cast down, since the only way in which those men rise is by overturning the order of nature. And it ought to be carefully observed, that it is not more possible for wicked men to continue in prosperity than for God to permit his glory to be set aside. Though <em>judgment </em>is not at all different from <em>righteousness</em>, still the repetition is not superfluous. </p><p><em>And God, who is holy, shall be sanctified in righteousness. </em>The language becomes more vehement, that wicked men may not, by a false imagination, assure themselves of uninterrupted happiness, which they cannot have, unless by setting aside the <em>holiness </em>of God. But since God <em>is holy </em>by nature, he must be <em>sanctified</em>. Hence it follows that destruction hangs over the wicked, that their obstinacy and rebellion may be subdued, for God cannot deny himself. </p></div>
