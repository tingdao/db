<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>And Moses gave unto them. </em>We must understand that Moses <em>gave </em>it in such sort, as that, relying on God’s command, he laid down an inviolable law. For, although it is not expressly stated that God interposed His authority, still His subsequent approbation fully assures us of it. So also, although no mention is made of Eleazar and the elders, still it is certain that they were not passed over, but that they were united with him in the decision; especially since the case had been brought before them by the sons of Gad and Reuben, (ver. 2.) There is only an implied contrast between the old covenant which God had made with Abraham, and this new and special privilege, wherewith He condescended to enrich His people. </p><p>At first only the two tribes had been named; half the tribe of Manasseh is now added, inasmuch as the descendants of Machir, and Jair, and Noball, who were all of the family of Manasseh, had seized upon certain cities, and men. The rendering which some give, as if they <span class="cite-ref">(218)</span> had obtained these victories after Moses had permitted the Reubenites and Gadites to inhabit this side of Jordan, does not appear to me suitable; but rather the reason is given why that portion is excepted, which came to the sons of Manasseh, viz., because they were not to be defrauded of the lands which they had separately acquired. Nor is it probable, that, when the country beyond Jordan had been given to others, they afterwards made their incursion so as to appropriate what did not belong to them. The order of the narrative does not make this necessary; for it is common with the Hebrews to transpose the order of occurrences, especially when something before omitted is incidentally added to give a reason for what is done. If, however, any should prefer to believe that they were attracted by the advantage that presented itself, I will not pertinaciously contend the point. </p><p>But how does it accord that cities are said to be <em>built </em>which were still standing undestroyed? for we have already seen that the people who had taken them, were dwelling in them. I reply that, inasmuch as it seldom happens that cities are taken without the walls being destroyed, it is not unreasonable that the restoration of these should be called <em>building. </em>It was necessary that the cities should be fortified lest the unarmed multitude <span class="cite-ref">(219)</span> should be exposed to the assaults of every enemy. To this end they repaired what had been thrown down, and thus in a manner renewed the cities which were a mass of ruins. </p><p><strong>(218)</strong><em>C</em>. translates the verbs in <span class="bvs">Num_32:41</span> in the pluperfect tense, “Jair, the son of Manasseh, <em>had </em>gone and taken, etc.” </p><p><strong>(219)</strong> “La troupe des femmes et des petits enfans;” the multitude of women and little children. — <em>Fr. </em></p></div>
