<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_18:15</span><strong>.</strong><em>But if thy brother shall sin against thee. </em>As he had discoursed about bearing the infirmities of brethren, he now shows more clearly in what manner, and for what purpose, and to what extent, we ought to bear with them. For otherwise it would have been easy to reply, that there is no other way of avoiding offenses, than by every man winking at the faults of others, and thus what is evil would be encouraged by forbearance. Christ therefore prescribes a middle course, which does not give too great offense to the weak, and yet is adapted to cure their diseases; for that severity which is employed as a medicine is profitable and worthy of praise. In short, Christ enjoins his disciples to forgive one another, but to do so in such a manner as to endeavor to correct their faults. It is necessary that this be wisely observed; for nothing is more difficult than to exercise forbearance towards men, and, at the same time, not to neglect the freedom necessary in reproving them. <span class="cite-ref">(552)</span> Almost all lean to the one side or to the other, either to deceive themselves mutually by deadly flatteries, or to pursue with excessive bitterness those whom they ought to cure. But Christ recommends to his disciples a mutual love, which is widely distant from flattery; only he enjoins them to season their admonitions with moderation, lest, by excessive severity and harshness, they discourage the weak. </p><p>Now he distinctly lays down three steps of brotherly correction. The first is, to give a private advice to the person who has offended. The second is, if he shall give any sign of obstinacy, to advise him again in presence of <em>witnesses</em>. The third is, if no advantage shall be obtained in that way, to deliver him up to the public decision of <em>the Church</em>. The design of this, as I have said, is, to hinder charity from being violated under the pretence of fervent zeal. As the greater part of men are driven by ambition to publish with excessive eagerness the faults of their brethren, Christ seasonably meets this fault by enjoining us to cover the faults of brethren, as far as lies in our power; for those who take pleasure in the disgrace and infamy of brethren are unquestionably carried away by hatred and malice, since, if they were under the influence of charity, they would endeavor to prevent the shame of their brethren. </p><p>But it is asked, Ought this rule to be extended indiscriminately to every kind of offense? For there are very many who do not allow any public censures, till the <em>offender </em>has been privately admonished. But there is an obvious limitation in the words of Christ; for he does not simply, and without exception, order us to advise or reprove privately, and in the absence of witnesses, all who have <em>offended</em>, but bids us attempt this method, when we have been <em>offended </em>in private; by which is meant, not that it is a business of our own, but that we ought to be wounded and grieved whenever God is <em>offended</em>. And Christ does not now speak about bearing injuries, but teaches us in general to cultivate such meekness towards each other, as not to ruin by harsh treatment those whom we ought to save. <span class="cite-ref">(553)</span></p><p><em>Against thee. </em>This expression, as is evident from what we have said, does not denote an injury committed against any one, but distinguishes between secret and open sins. <span class="cite-ref">(554)</span> For if any man shall <em>offend </em>against the whole Church, Paul enjoins that he be publicly reproved, so that even <em>elders </em>shall not be spared; for it is in reference to them that he expressly enjoins Timothy, to </p><p>rebuke them publicly in presence of all, and thus to make them a general example to others, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Ti_5:20</span>.) </p><p>And certainly it would be absurd that he who has committed a public offense, so that the disgrace of it is generally known, should be admonished by individuals; for if a thousand persons are aware of it, he ought to receive a thousand admonitions. The distinction, therefore, which Christ expressly lays down, ought to be kept in mind, that no man may bring disgrace upon <em>his brother</em>, by rashly, and without necessity, divulging secret offenses. </p><p><em>If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. </em>Christ confirms his doctrine by its usefulness and advantage; for it is no small matter to <em>gain </em>to God a soul which had been the slave of Satan. And how comes it that those who have fallen do not often repent, but because they are regarded with hatred, and treated as enemies, and thus acquire a character of hardened obstinacy? Nothing, therefore, is more appropriate than meekness, which reconciles to God those who had departed from him. On the other hand, he who inconsiderately indulges in foolish flattery willingly places in jeopardy the salvation of a <em>brother</em>, which he had in his hand. </p><p>According to <em>Luke</em>, Christ expressly enjoins us to be satisfied with a private reproof, if the <em>brother </em>be brought to <em>repentance </em>Hence, too, we infer how necessary it is that mutual freedom of reproof should subsist among believers. For, since each of us in many ways commits daily offenses, it would be outrageous cruelty to betray, by our silence and concealment, the salvation of those whom we might, by mild reproof, rescue from perdition. Though it does not always succeed, yet he is chargeable with heinous guilt, who has neglected the remedy which the Lord prescribes for promoting the salvation of the brethren. It is also worthy of notice, that the Lord, in order to render us more zealous in performing our duty, ascribes to us that honor which is his own; for to him alone, and to no other, does it belong to convert a man; and yet he bestows on us this applause, though we did not deserve it, that we <em>gain a brother </em>who was lost. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(552)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que toutesfois on retiene tousiours ceste liberte de reprendre ce qui est a condamner</span>;” — “so as at the same time to reserve always that liberty of reproving what is worthy of condemnation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(553)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lesquels nous devions plustost tascher d’amener a salut</span>;” — “whom we ought rather to attempt to lead to salvation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(554)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais pour distinguer et mettre difference entre les pechez secrets, et les offenses manifestes</span>;” — “but to distinguish and put a difference between secret sins and open offenses.” </p></div></div>
