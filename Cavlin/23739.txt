<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_18:11</span><strong>.</strong><em>For the Son of man cometh </em>Christ now employs his own example in persuading his disciples to honor even weak and despised brethren; for he came down from heaven to save not them only, but even the dead who were <em>lost </em>It is in the highest degree unreasonable that we should disdainfully reject those whom the Son of God has so highly esteemed. And even if the weak labor under imperfections which may expose them to contempt, our pride is not on that account to be excused; for we ought to esteem them not for the value of their virtues, but for the sake of Christ; and he who will not conform himself to Christâ€™s example is too saucy and proud. </p></div>
