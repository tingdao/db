<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_7:11</span><strong>.</strong><em>And it happened, that he went into a city. </em>In all the miracles of Christ, we must attend to the rule which Matthew lays down. We ought to know, therefore, that this young man, whom Christ raised from the dead, is an emblem of the spiritual life which he restores to us. The name of the city contributes to the certainty of the history. The same purpose is served by what Luke says, that <em>a great multitude </em>from every direction followed him: for Christ had many attendants along with him, and many persons accompanied the woman, as a mark of respect, to the interment of her son. The resurrection of the young man was beheld by so many witnesses, that no doubt could be entertained as to its truth. There was the additional circumstance of its being a crowded place: for we know that public assemblies were held at the gates. That the dead man was carried out of the city was in accordance with a very ancient custom among all nations. <em>Jerome </em>says that, in his time, the city of Nain was still in existence, two miles below Mount Tabor, in a southerly direction. </p></div>
