<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>And as it is appointed, etc. </em>The meaning is this: since we patiently wait after death for the day of judgment, it being the common lot of nature which it is not right to struggle against; why should there be less patience in waiting for the second coming of Christ? For if a long interval of time does not diminish, as to men, the hope of a happy resurrection, how unreasonable would it be to render less honor to Christ? But less would it be, were we to call upon him to undergo a second death, when he had once died. Were any one to object and say, that some had died twice, such as Lazarus, and not <em>once; </em>the answer would be this, â€” that the Apostle speaks here of the ordinary lot of men; but they are to be excepted from this condition, who shall by an instantaneous change put off corruption, (<span class="bvs">1Co_15:51</span>;) for he includes none but those who wait for a long time in the dust for the redemption of their bodies. </p></div>
