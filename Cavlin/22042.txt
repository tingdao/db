<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the angel begins to treat of the kings of Egypt and of Syria. He does not mention the king of Syria yet, but will do so in the next verse; but he begins with the king of Egypt, the neighboring monarchy to that of Israel. He says, the king of the south, meaning, the king of Egypt, would be brave. He next adds, <em>and one of his princes. </em>Many take this in one context; but I think the angel transfers his discourse to Antiochus the son of Seleucus. <em>And one of his princes, </em>he says, meaning, one of Alexander’s princes, shall strengthen himself against him. For the letter <span class="lang he-il">ו</span>,<em>vau, </em>is taken in the sense of opposing, and implies an opposition between Ptolemy the son of Lagus, and Antiochus king of Syria. <em>Hence the king of the south shall grow strong </em>— another of Alexander’s chiefs shall grow strong against him, and shall have dominion. We know how much larger and more wealthy the kingdom of Syria was than that of Egypt, especially when Asia Minor was added to it. Without doubt, the angel was acquainted with the future superiority of Antiochus to Ptolemy, when these two kings are mutually compared. But the rest to-morrow. </p></div>
