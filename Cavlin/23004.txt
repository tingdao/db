<div class="comment-content"><p>He now declares that God would be an avenger. Behold, he says, <em>Jehovah will possess</em>, or cause to possess, as some read, but they are mistaken, owing to the two meanings of the verb <span class="lang he-il">ירש</span>, <em>iresh</em>, which means to possess and also to expel or impoverish; <span class="cite-ref">(97)</span> for interpreters think that a hope of favor and of salvation is here given to these cities, and say that they are now chosen by God as a possession. But this is wholly contrary to the intention of the Prophet, as it appears more clearly from a view of each clause. </p><p><em>Jehovah </em>then <em>will expel her, and smite her strength</em>. The Prophet no doubt alludes to what he had already said — that Tyrus had heaped silver and gold; now on the other hand he declares that Tyrus would be exposed to a scattering; for the heap of gold and silver it had laid up would be dissipated by God: <em>he will then dissipate</em>; or if one chooses to take the verb as meaning to reduce to want, the contrast would thus be suitable — God <em>will </em>then <em>impoverish</em>, or expel her. Afterwards he adds, <em>In the sea will he smite her strength</em>. As Tyrus, we know, was surrounded by the sea, the Prophet by this reference shows God’s power in taking vengeance on her; for the sea would be no restraint or hindrance to God, when he resolved to enter there. The Syrians, indeed, thought themselves safe from every hostile attack, for they had the sea on every side as a triple wall and a triple rampart. Nor was Tyrus altogether like Venice; for Venice is situated in a stagnant sea, while the situation of Tyrus was in a very deep sea, as historians plainly show who relate its assault by Alexander the Great. It had indeed been before taken and plundered; but he did what none had ever thought of — he filled up a part of the sea, so that Tyrus was no longer an island. </p><p>We now see what Zechariah had in view, when he threatened ruin to Tyrus, though its strength was in the midst of the sea, beyond the reach of fortune, as it is commonly said. <em>And she shall be consumed by fire</em>. He means that Tyrus would not only be plundered, but wholly demolished; for we know that even the strongest things are consumed by fire. It follows — </p><p><strong>(97)</strong> This verb is here confounded with [<span class="lang he-il">רש</span> ], which means to impoverish in Hiphil. But the Hiphil of [<span class="lang he-il">יוש</span> ] has the idea of expelling or driving out; it means literally to cause one to be inherited or heired, that is, by making another to succeed in his place. To dispossess, according to <em>Henderson</em>, rather than to cast out, according to our version and <em>Newcome</em>, is the idea of the original. The explanation here disapproved by <em>Calvin</em>, which is wholly inconsistent with the whole passage, has been derived from the <em>Septuagint</em>, who have rendered the verb as though it were in Kal, [<span class="lang el-gr">κληρονομησει</span> ]. The <em>Targum </em>gives it the idea of driving or casting out. The Greek fathers, <em>Theodoret </em>and <em>Cyril</em>, not knowing Hebrew, could give no other explanation. Similar has been the source of not a few interpretations given by the fathers. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
