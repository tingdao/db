<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Woe to, the foolish </em>or disgraceful <em>prophets </em><span class="lang he-il">נבל</span>, <em>nebel</em>, signifies “a vile person,” “a castaway,” just as <span class="lang he-il">נבלה</span>, <em>nebeleh</em>, means “foulness,” “crime,” “wickedness,” although <span class="lang he-il">נבל</span>, <em>nebel</em>, is oftener taken for folly, and I willingly embrace this sense as it is generally received. He calls false prophets foolish, because they doubtless fiercely insulted the true servants of God — just like upstarts puffed up with wonderful self-conceit; for the devil, who reigns in them, is the father of pride: hence they carry themselves haughtily, arrogate all things to themselves, and wish to be thought angels come down from heaven. And when Paul speaks of human fictions, he grants them the form of wisdom. (<span class="bvs">Col_2:23</span>.) Hence there is no doubt that these pretenders of whom Ezekiel speaks were held in great esteem, and so, when swollen with bombast, they puffed forth surprising wisdom; but meanwhile the Holy Spirit shortly pronounces them fools: for whatever pleases the world under the mask of wisdom, we know to be mere folly before God. </p><p>Now he adds, <em>who walk after their own spirit, without seeing any thing: </em>that is, when no vision has been given them. Ezekiel explains himself more clearly, or rather the Spirit who spoke through him. As, therefore, he has lately condemned all who prophesy out of their own mind or heart, — for the noun “heart” is here used for “intellect,” as in other places, — as, therefore, the Spirit has lately condemned all such, so he says that those <em>who walk after their own spirit </em>wickedly abuse the prophetic office. He here alludes to the prophetic gift when he speaks of “spirit.” For, because they might object that false prophets did not speak from their own heart, but had secret revelations, he concedes to them the use of the word “spirit” by a rhetorical figure, <span class="cite-ref">(2)</span> and thus refutes their boasting, as if Ezekiel had said that those fictitious revelations are mere fancies: they have indeed something in them more than common, but still they are fanatics. This then is the sense of the word “spirit.” Meanwhile there is no doubt that he repeats what he lately saw, and the contrast removes all doubt. <em>Without seeing any thing</em>, says he: thus vision is opposed to the human heart and spirit; but what is vision but a supernatural gift? When, therefore, God raises his servants above the capacity of human ability, and makes them discern what no mortal power can bestow, that is a vision; and if a vision is removed, nothing will remain but the spirit or heart of man. Hence those who cannot really show that their utterance is evidently inspired, shall be compelled to confess that they speak of their own minds. It follows — </p><p><strong>(2)</strong> Calvin uses the Greek word <span class="lang el-gr">καταχρηστικῶς</span>, meaning in rhetoric the use of a word in a sense different from its natural one. <em>Catachresis </em>is the grammatical term, implying the use of terms in their “non-natural” sense. The French has “<span class="lang fr-fr">neantmoins que ce soit improprentent</span>.” </p></div>
