<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22</strong><em>By works was faith made perfect </em><span class="cite-ref">(119)</span> By this he again shews, that the question here is not respecting the cause of our salvation, but whether works necessarily accompany faith; for in this sense it is said to have been perfected by works, because it was not idle. It is said to have been perfected by works, not because it received thence its own perfection, but because it was thus proved to be true. For the futile distinction which the Sophists draw from these words, between formed and unformed faith, needs no labored refutation; for the faith of Abram was formed and therefore perfected before he sacrificed his son. And this work was not as it were the finishing, or last work. Formerly things afterwards followed by which Abraham proved the increase of his faith. Hence this was not the perfection of his faith, nor did it then for the first time put on its form. James then understood no other thing, than that the integrity of his faith then appeared, because it brought forth that remarkable fruit of obedience. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(119)</span> The previous sentence is hardly intelligible in our version or in <em>Calvin’s. </em>“Seest thou how faith wrought (co-operated, by <em>C</em>.) with his works?” The verb is <span class="lang el-gr">συνεργέω</span>, which means properly to work together, to co-operate; and it means also, as the effect of co-operating, to aid, to help. “Seest thou how faith aided him in his works?” <em>Schleusner </em>gives this paraphrase, “Thou sees that Abraham was aided by his faith to do his remarkable works.” <em>Beza’s </em>version is, “Thou seest that faith was the assistant (<em>administer</em>) of his works.” Some give the idea of combining to co-operating, “Thou seest that faith co-operated with his works,” that is, in justification. It has been said, that if this combination had been intended, it ought to have been said that works co-operated with his faith, as faith, according to the testimony of scripture and the nature of things, is the primary and the principal thing, and as there can be no good works without faith. But the first explanation is the most consonant with the words and with the drift of the passage. </p></div></div>
