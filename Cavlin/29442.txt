<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21</strong><em>Who will change </em>By this argument he stirs up the Philippians still farther to lift up their minds to heaven, and be wholly attached to Christ — because this body which we carry about with us is not an everlasting abode, but a frail tabernacle, which will in a short time be reduced to nothing. Besides, it is liable to so many miseries, and so many dishonorable infirmities, that it may justly be spoken of as <em>vile </em>and full of ignominy. Whence, then, is its restoration to be hoped for? From heaven, at Christ’s coming. Hence there is no part of us that ought not to aspire after heaven with undivided affection. We see, on the one hand, in life, but chiefly in death, the present meanness of our bodies; the glory which they will have, conformably to Christ’s body, is incomprehensible by us: for if the disciples could not endure the slight taste which he afforded <span class="cite-ref">(206)</span> in his transfiguration, (<span class="bvs">Mat_17:6</span>,) which of us could attain its fullness? Let us for the present be contented with the evidence of our adoption, being destined to know the riches of our inheritance when we shall come to the enjoyment of them. </p><p><em>According to the efficacy </em>As nothing is more difficult to believe, or more at variance with carnal perception, than the resurrection, Paul on this account places before our eyes the boundless power of God, that it may entirely remove all doubt; for distrust arises from this — that we measure the thing itself by the narrowness of our own understanding. Nor does he simply make mention of <em>power, </em>but also of <em>efficacy, </em>which is the effect, or power showing itself in action, so to speak. Now, when we bear in mind that God, who created all things out of nothing, can command the earth, and the sea, and the other elements, to render back what has been committed to them <span class="cite-ref">(207)</span>, our minds are imrnediately roused up to a firm hope — nay, even to a spiritual contemplation of the resurrection. </p><p>But it is of importance to take notice, also, that the right and power of raising the dead, nay more, of doing everything according to his own pleasure, is assigned to the person of Christ — an encomium by which his Divine majesty is illustriously set forth. Nay, farther, we gather from this, that the world was created by him, for to <em>subject all things to himself </em>belongs to the Creator alone. </p><p><strong>(206)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De sa Gloire</span>;” — “Of his glory.” </p><p><strong>(207)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il leur auoit donne en garde</span>;” — “What he had given to them to keep.” </p></div>
