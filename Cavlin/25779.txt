<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_19:47</span><strong>.</strong><em>And he taught daily in the temple. </em>Mark and Luke point out, <em>first, </em>what was the class of men of which the Church consisted, namely, of the despised multitude; and again, what enemies Christ had, namely, <em>the priests and scribes, </em>and all the <em>rulers. </em>Now this is a part of the folly of the cross, that God, passing by the excellence of the world, chooses what is foolish, weak, and despised. <em>Secondly, </em>they relate that those worthy guardians of the Church of God sought an occasion of putting Christ to death, by which their wicked impiety was discovered; for though there had been good grounds for pursuing Christ, yet they had no right to proceed to murder after the manner of robbers, or secretly to hire assassins. <em>Thirdly, </em>they show that the wicked conspiracy of those men was frustrated, because, by the secret purpose of God, Christ was appointed to the death of the cross. </p></div>
