<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>Pray for us</em>. Though the Lord powerfully aided him, and though he surpassed all others in earnestness of prayer, he nevertheless does not despise the prayers of believers, by which the Lord would have us aided. It becomes us, after his example, eagerly to desire this aid, and to stir up our brethren to pray for us. </p><p>When, however, he adds — <em>that the word of God may have its course</em>, he shows that he has not so much concern and regard for himself personally, as for the entire Church. For why does he desire to be recommended to the prayers of the Thessalonians? That the doctrine of the gospel may <em>have its course</em>. He does not desire, therefore, so much that regard should be had to himself individually, as to the glory of God and the common welfare of the Church. <em>Course </em>means here dissemination; <span class="cite-ref">(692)</span><em>glory </em>means something farther, — that his preaching may have its power and efficacy for renewing men after the image of God. Hence, holiness of life and uprightness on the part of Christians is the glory of the gospel; as, on the other hand, those defame the gospel who make profession of it with the mouth, while in the meantime they live in wickedness and baseness. He says — <em>as among you; </em>for this should be a stimulus to the pious, to see all others like them. Hence those that have already entered into the kingdom of God are exhorted to pray daily that it may <em>come</em>.
