<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23</strong><em>I walk about as a shadow. </em>These are two very appropriate similitudes: to the first of them I formerly adverted in <span class="bvs">Psa_102:12</span>; namely, that the afflicted person, and he who is almost lifeless, is very fitly compared to the shadow of the evening. At sunrise, or when he is shining in noon-day brightness, the constant shifting of the shadow is not so perceptible; but, towards sunset, the shadow flits before us during every moment that passes. By the other similitude, the transitory nature of all sublunary things is pointed out. For as the locusts are constantly skipping from one place to another, so David complains of his life being ever rendered uneasy by incessant persecution, so that no space was allowed him for repose; and this is similar to what he says in <span class="bvs">Psa_11:1</span>, that he was compelled to flee like a sparrow, for which the fowler lays snares in all directions. In short, he mourns over his forlorn situation, that he could find no place of safety, and that, even among men, he could get no habitation. And, as in this psalm, he presents us with a picture of the whole Church, we need not be surprised if God try us, and arouse us from our lethargy, by an innumerable variety of events. Accordingly, Paul, <span class="bvs">1Co_4:11</span>, speaking of himself and others, says, that they have no certain dwelling-place; a description which is more or less applicable to all the children of God. </p></div>
