<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_4:22</span><strong>.</strong><em>And they immediately left the ship. </em>The <em>first </em>thing that strikes us here is the power of Christâ€™s voice. Not that his voice alone makes so powerful an impression on the hearts of men: but those whom the Lord is pleased to lead and draw to himself, are inwardly addressed by his Spirit, that they may obey his voice. The <em>second </em>is, the commendation bestowed on the docility and ready obedience of his disciples, who prefer the call of Christ to all worldly affairs. The ministers of the Word ought, in a particular manner, to be directed by this example, to lay aside all other occupations, and to devote themselves unreservedly to the Church, to which they are appointed. </p></div>
