<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And I said, My death, the years of the right hand, etc. </em>This passage has been explained in various ways. Some deriving the word <span class="lang he-il">חלותי</span>, <em>challothi, </em>from <span class="lang he-il">חלה</span><em>, chalah, </em>which signifies <em>to kill, </em>consider the prophet as meaning, that being overwhelmed with an accumulation of calamities, the only conclusion to which he could come was, that God had appointed him to utter destruction; and that his language is a confession of his having fallen into despair. Others translate it <em>to be sick, to be infirm </em>or <em>enfeebled, </em>which is much more agreeable to the scope of the passage. <span class="cite-ref">(296)</span> But they differ with respect to the meaning. According to some interpreters, the prophet accuses and reproves himself for his effeminacy of mind, and for not setting himself more manfully to resist temptation. <span class="cite-ref">(297)</span> This exposition may be admitted; for the people of God ordinarily gather courage after having for a time wavered under the shock of temptation. I, however, prefer a different interpretation, namely, that this was a disease merely temporary, and on this account, he compares it indirectly to death; even as it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_118:18</span>, </p><p>“The Lord hath chastised me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.” Also, “I shall not die, but live.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_118:18</span>) </p><p>He, therefore, I have no doubt, unburdens himself by cherishing the confident persuasion, that although he was at present cast down, it was only for a season, and that therefore it behoved him patiently to endure this sickness or disease, since it was not mortal. Nor are commentators agreed in the explanation of the second clause. Those who connect this verse with the preceding verses, think that the prophet was reduced to such a state of despondency at first, that he looked upon himself as utterly undone; and that afterwards he lifted up his head at times, even as those who are thrown into the deep in a shipwreck repeatedly rise above the water. Besides, they would have this to be understood as a word of encouragement addressed by some one to the prophet, desiring him to call to remembrance the years in which he had experienced that God was merciful to him. But it will be more appropriate to understand it thus:, Thou hast no reason to think that thou art now doomed to death, since thou art not laboring under an incurable disease, and the hand of God is wont to make whole those whom it has stricken. I do not reject the opinion of those who translate <span class="lang he-il">שנות</span>, <em>shenoth, </em>by <em>changes; </em><span class="cite-ref">(298)</span> for as the Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">שנה</span><em>, shanah, </em>signifies <em>to change, </em>or <em>to do a thing again and again, </em>the Hebrews have taken from it the word <span class="lang he-il">שנות</span>, <em>shenoth, </em>which they employ to denote <em>years, </em>from their revolving character, from their turning round, as it were, in the same orbit. But in whatever way we may understand it, the comfort of which I have spoken will remain firm, which is, that the prophet, assuring himself of a favorable change in his condition, does not look upon himself as doomed to death. Others give a somewhat different interpretation, arriving at it in another way: <span class="cite-ref">(299)</span> as if the prophet had said, Why shouldst thou not patiently endure the severity of God at this time, when hitherto he has cherished thee by his beneficence? even as Job said, </p><p>“Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not <LineBreak />also receive evil?” (<span class="bvs">Job_2:10</span>) </p><p>But it is more probable that the prophet directs his view to the future, and means that it became him to await the years or revolutions of the right hand of the Most High, until lie should afford clear and undisputed evidence of the return of his favor towards him. </p><p><strong>(296)</strong> Walford translates, “Then I said, My disease is this. “Such,” he observes, “is the exact rendering of the text. Some painful disease had befallen him, which was heightened by the depression of his spirits, which deprived him of mental vigor and energy, and clothed every object in the blackest colours.... ‘I said, This is my disease.’ My mind is oppressed by the mortified feelings of my corporeal frame, and on this account, the changes by which the hand of God has affected me appear in the darkest colours, and I am ready to give up every hope that he will ever display his goodness to me as he formerly did.” </p><p><strong>(297)</strong> According to this view, he refers to what he had said in the 7<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, and 9<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verses, in which he seemed to arrive at the conclusion, that there would never be an end to his present afflictions, as if the decree had gone forth, and God had pronounced a final and irreversible sentence. But here he checks and corrects himself for having given utterance to such language, and recalls his thoughts to more just and encouraging sentiments respecting God. He acknowledges his sin in questioning or yielding to a feeling of suspicion in reference to the divine love, and the truth of the divine promises; and confesses that this flowed from the corruption of his nature, and the weakness of his faith; that he had spoken rashly and in haste; and that taking shame and confusion of face to himself, he would now desist and proceed no farther. </p><p><strong>(298)</strong> Walford translates the verse thus: — </p><p>“Then I said, My disease is this, <LineBreak />The change of the right hand of the High God.” </p><p>“There is no authority,” he observes, “for the version, ‘I will remember the years;’ his meaning is, the power of God has changed and altered my condition; from a state of health and peace, he has brought me into disease, and pain, and sorrow. This, he says, he will remember, so as to inspire some hope that the power which had brought low would again raise him up.” </p><p><strong>(299)</strong> Our Author seems to refer to those interpreters who, as in our English version, make the supplement, <em>But I will remember</em>, before the words, “the years of the right hand of the Most High.” </p></div>
