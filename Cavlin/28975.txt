<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>For the weapons of our warfare. </em>The warfare corresponds with the kind of weapons. He glories in being furnished with <em>spiritual </em>weapons. The warfare, accordingly, is <em>spiritual. </em>Hence it follows by way of contraries, <span class="cite-ref">(755)</span> that it is <em>not according to the flesh </em>In comparing the ministry of the gospel to a <em>warfare, </em>he uses a most apt similitude. The life of a Christian, it is true, is a perpetual warfare, for whoever gives himself to the service of God will have no truce from Satan at any time, but will be harassed with incessant disquietude. It becomes, however, ministers of the word and pastors to be standard-bearers, going before the others; and, certainly, there are none that Satan harasses more, that are more severely assaulted, or that sustain more numerous or more dreadful onsets. That man, therefore, is mistaken, who girds himself for the discharge of this office, and is not at the same time furnished with courage and bravery for contending; for he is not exercised otherwise than in fighting. For we must take this into account, that the gospel is like a fire, by which the fury of Satan is en-kindled. Hence it cannot but be that he will arm himself for a contest, whenever he sees that it is advanced. </p><p>But by what weapons is he to be repelled? It is only by spiritual weapons that he can be repelled. Whoever, therefore, is unarmed with the influence of the Holy Spirit, however he may boast that he is a minister of Christ, will nevertheless, not prove himself to be such. At the same time, if you would have a full enumeration of spiritual weapons, doctrine must be conjoined with zeal, and a good conscience with the efficacy of the Spirit, and with other necessary graces. Let now the Pope go, and assume to himself the apostolic dignity <span class="cite-ref">(756)</span> What could be more ridiculous, if our judgment is to be formed in accordance with the rule here laid down by Paul! </p><p><em>Mighty through God. </em>Either <em>according to God, </em>or <em>from God. </em>I am of opinion, that there is here an implied antithesis, so that this <em>strength </em>is placed in contrast with the <em>weakness </em>which appears outwardly before the world, and thus, paying no regard to the judgments of men, he would seek from God approbation of his fortitude. <span class="cite-ref">(757)</span> At the same time, the <em>antithesis </em>will hold good in another sense — that the power of his arms depends upon God, not upon the world. </p><p><em>In the demolishing of fortresses. </em>He makes use of the term <em>fortresses </em>to denote contrivances, and every high thing that is exalted against God, <span class="cite-ref">(758)</span> as to which we shall find him speaking afterwards. It is, however, with propriety and expressiveness that he so designates them; for his design is to boast, that there is nothing in the world so strongly fortified as to be beyond his power to overthrow. I am well aware how carnal men glory in their empty shows, and how disdainfully and recklessly they despise me, as though there were nothing in me but what is mean and base, while they, in the mean time, were standing on a lofty eminence. But their confidence is foolish, for that armor of the Lord, with which I fight, will prevail in opposition to all the bulwarks, in reliance upon which they believe themselves to be invincible. Now, as the world is accustomed to fortify itself in a twofold respect for waging war with Christ — on the one hand, by cunning, by wicked artifices, by subtilty, and other secret machinations; and, on the other hand, by cruelty and oppression, he touches upon both these methods. For by <em>contrivances </em>he means, whatever pertains to carnal wisdom. </p><p>The term <em>high thing </em>denotes any kind of glory and power in this world. There is no reason, therefore, why a servant of Christ should dread anything, however formidable, that may stand up in opposition to his doctrine. Let him, in spite of it, persevere, and he will scatter to the winds every machination of whatever sort. Nay more, the kingdom of Christ cannot be set up or established, otherwise than by throwing down everything in the world that is exalted. For nothing is more opposed to the spiritual wisdom of God than the wisdom of the flesh; nothing is more at variance with the grace of God than man’s natural ability, and so as to other things. Hence the only foundation of Christ’s kingdom is the abasement of men. And to this effect are those expressions in the Prophets: </p><p>The moon shall be ashamed, and the sun shall be confounded,<LineBreak />when the Lord shall begin to reign in that day; (<span class="bvs">Isa_24:23</span>.) </p><p>Again, </p><p>The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the high looks of mortals shall be abased, and the Lord alone shall be <LineBreak />exalted in that day.(<span class="bvs">Isa_5:15</span>, and <span class="bvs">Isa_2:17</span>) </p><p>Because, in order that God alone may shine forth, it is necessary that the glory of the world should vanish away. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(755)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par vn argument prins (comme on appelle) des choses contraires</span>;” — “By an argument taken (as the expression is) from things contrary.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(756)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il s’attribue tant qu’il voudra le titre de dignite Apostolique</span>;” — “Let him assume to himself, as much as he pleases, the title of Apostolic dignity.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(757)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Aiusi le sens seroit, que laissant la tousles jugemens des hommes, il se retireroit vers Dieu pour auoir approbation de sa force</span>;” — “Thus the meaning would be, that, disregarding all the judgments of men, he would direct his view God-ward to have approbation of his fortitude.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(758)</span> “The word here rendered <em>strongholds </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">ὀχυρώματα)</span> means properly — fastnesses, fortresses, or strong fortifications. It is here beautifully used to denote the various obstacles, resembling a <em>fortress, </em>which exist, and which are designed and adapted to oppose the truth and the triumph of the Christian’s cause. All these obstacles are strongly fortified [...] The whole world is <em>fortified </em>against Christianity; and the nations of the earth have been engaged in little else, than in raising and strengthening such strongholds for the space of six thousand years. The Christian religion goes forth against all the combined and concentrated powers of resistance of the whole world; and the warfare is to be waged against every strongly <em>fortified </em>place of error and of sin. These strong <em>fortifications </em>of error and of sin are to be battered down and laid in ruins by our spiritual weapons.” — <em>Barnes. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
