<div class="comment-content"><p>We now understand what the design of the Prophet was, when he spoke of the Jews as saying, that the <em>city was delivered up </em>to the Chaldeans and the Babylonians, even because the promised deliverance could afford them no comfort, inasmuch as they fully believed that their salvation was hopeless. <em>Ye </em>then <em>say, </em>he says, <em>that the city has been delivered up; but I, </em>he adds, <em>will gather them from all the lands to which I shall drive them in my wrath and hot displeasure and great indignation </em><span class="cite-ref">(79)</span></p><p>Here God promises that the exile would only be temporary, because he would at length gather, as it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_147:2</span>, the dispersed of Israel. No name is here expressed, but a pronoun; there is however no ambiguity, for it is sufficiently evident that he speaks of the Jews when he says, <em>I will gather them </em>As they had been scattered here and there, the gathering of them might have appeared incredible; for had they been only driven from their own country, and a place of exile had been granted them where they might have lived together, they might have hoped some time to return: but the scattering took away every hope, for they had been driven into different countries, and far distant from each other. In order then to obviate this difficulty, God expressly says that he would restore them <em>from all the lands into which he had driven them </em>And the Prophet no doubt alludes to a passage in <span class="bvs">Deu_30:4</span>, </p><p>“Though they be scattered to the four quarters of the world, <LineBreak />I will thence gather them.” </p><p>As then God had through Moses promised, that though they were banished into the farthest parts of the world, yet their restoration would not be difficult to him; so the Prophet applies this declaration of Moses to his own prophecy, even that God would gather from the whole of the East those who had been scattered. </p><p>He adds, <em>in my wrath, hot displeasure, and great indignation </em><span class="cite-ref">(80)</span> God does not here speak of his wrath, but in order that the Jews might perceive that they deserved so great a punishment: for we know that as God is the judge of the world, nothing unjust can belong to him. When therefore God’s wrath is said to be great, we may with certainty conclude that the vices of men are great; for he is never angry with us, except when he is offended by the greatness of our sins. We hence perceive the reason why the Prophet mentions here the <em>wrath, the hot displeasure and great indignation </em>of God, even that the faithful might feel assured that God would be propitious to them, though they were worthy of eternal ruin. In short, Jeremiah shews that there would be a place for God’s mercy, though the Jews had merited destruction a hundred times through their obstinacy. </p><p>And he adds that his favor would be continued, <em>And I will cause them to dwell safely </em>After having promised to them a return, he promises now a tranquil condition: for it would have been better for the Jews to remain always in exile and in foreign lands, than to return to their own country and to live there in misery. This was the reason why the Prophet expressly added, that there would be a quiet habitation for them. </p><p>But we know that this was not fulfilled when the Jews returned to their own country; for they were greatly harassed by their neighbors, and the building of the Temple was at first hindered, and they endured many troubles from all quarters, and at length they were oppressed with tyranny by the Syrian kings, and reduced to such extremities, that exile would not only have been more tolerable, but even pleasanter and more desirable, in comparison with the many miseries with which they were oppressed. But, as it has been said elsewhere, whenever the Prophets prophesied of the return of the people, they extended what they taught to the whole kingdom of Christ. For liberation from exile was no more than the beginning of God’s favor: God began the work of true and real redemption when he restored his people to their own country; but he gave them but a slight taste of his mercy. This prophecy, then, with those which are like it, ought to be extended to the kingdom of Christ. He afterwards adds, — </p><p><strong>(79)</strong> This promise clearly shews what <em>Calvin </em>says as to their meaning in saying “The city has been delivered up,” etc. that is, irretrievably. No, says God, I will restore it. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(80)</strong> There is a gradation in the words, — wrath, hot wrath, foaming wrath. Extreme displeasure betokens, as <em>Calvin </em>intimates, extreme wickedness, and inflicts extreme punishment. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
