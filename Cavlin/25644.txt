<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And, lifting up, his eyes in hell. </em>Though Christ is relating a history, yet he describes spiritual things under figures, which he knew to be adapted to our senses. Souls have neither <em>fingers </em>nor <em>eyes, </em>and are not liable to thirst, nor do they hold such conversations among themselves as are here described to have taken place between <em>Abraham </em>and <em>the rich man; </em>but our Lord has here drawn a picture, which represents the condition of the life to come according to the measure of our capacity. The general truth conveyed is, that believing souls, when they have left their bodies, lead a joyful and blessed life out of this world, and that for the reprobate there are prepared dreadful torments, which can no more be conceived by our minds than the boundless glory of the heavens. As it is only in a small measure—only so far as we are enlightened by the Spirit of God—that we taste by hope the glory promised to us, which far exceeds all our senses, let it be reckoned enough that the inconceivable vengeance of God, which awaits the ungodly, is communicated to us in an obscure manner, so far as is necessary to strike terror into our minds. </p><p>On these subjects the words of Christ give us slender information, and in a manner which is fitted to restrain curiosity. The wicked are described as fearfully tormented by the misery which they feel; as desiring some relief, but cut off from hope, and thus experiencing a double torment; and as having their anguish increased by being compelled to remember their crimes, and to compare the present blessedness of believers with their own miserable and lost condition. In connection with this a conversation is related, as if persons who have no intercourse with each other were supposed to talk together. When <em>the rich man </em>says, <em>Father Abraham, </em>this expresses an additional torment, that he perceives, when it is too late, that he is cut off from the number of the children of <em>Abraham </em></p></div>
