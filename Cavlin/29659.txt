<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>When he shall come to be sanctified</em>. As he has hitherto discoursed as to the punishment of the wicked, he now returns to the pious, and says that Christ will come, that he may be <em>glorified </em>in them; that is, that he may irradiate them with his glory, and that they may be partakers of it. “Christ will not have this glory for himself individually; but it will be common to all the saints.” This is the crowning and choice consolation of the pious, that when the Son of God will be manifested in the glory of his kingdom, he will gather them into the same fellowship with himself. <span class="cite-ref">(633)</span> There is, however, an implied contrast between the present condition in which believers labor and groan, and that final restoration. For they are <em>now </em>exposed to the reproaches of the world, and are looked upon as vile and worthless; but <em>then </em>they will be precious, and full of dignity, when Christ will pour forth his glory upon them. The end of this is, that the pious may as it were, with closed eyes, pursue the brief journey of this earthly life, having their minds always intent upon the future manifestation of Christ’s kingdom. For to what purpose does he make mention of His coming in power, but in order that they may in hope leap forward to that blessed resurrection which is as yet hid? </p><p>It is also to be observed, that after having made use of the term <em>saints</em>, he adds, by way of explanation — <em>those that believe</em>, by which he intimates that there is no holiness in men without faith, but that all are profane. In the close he again repeats the terms — <em>in that day, </em>for that expression is connected with this sentence. Now, he repeats it with this view, that he may repress the desires of believers, lest they should hasten forward beyond due bounds. </p><p><em>Because credit was given </em>What he had said in a general way as to saints, he now applies to the Thessalonians, that they may not doubt that they are of that number. </p><p>“Because,” says he, “my preaching has obtained credit among you, Christ has already enrolled you in the number of his own people, whom he will make partakers of his glory.” </p><p>He calls his doctrine a <em>testimony</em>, because the Apostles are Christ’s <em>witnesses</em>. (<span class="bvs">Act_1:8</span>.) Let us learn, therefore, that the promises of God are ratified in us, when they gain credit with us. </p><p><strong>(633)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il les recueillera en plene conionction, et les fera ses consors</span>;” — “He will gather them in full union, and will make them his partners.” </p></div>
