<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Thou shalt not go with them. </em>If there were any room for doubt, God peremptorily removes it, and confirms the prohibition; because it was unlawful to curse, those whom He had blessed. For nothing more is permitted to prophets than that they should be the witnesses, or ambassadors <em>(internuntii,) </em>or heralds of the grace which God freely deigns to bestow at His own pleasure upon whom He will. Moreover, God is said to <em>bless </em>those whom He has embraced with His favor, and to whom He experimentally declares Himself to be propitious, when He displays His liberality towards them. Of this <em>blessing </em>He willed that the prophets should be His ministers in such a manner that the power should still remain altogether in His own hands. If, therefore, they usurp to themselves the prerogative of blessing without His commission, their act is not merely frivolous and inefficacious, but even blasphemous. Justly, then, does Ezekiel convict of falsehood and deception those false prophets, who, by their flatteries, encourage the souls which were doomed to die; whilst they slay by their terrors and threats those to whom God had promised life. (<span class="bvs">Eze_13:2</span> and 22.) Hence we gather, how vain it is for hypocrites, as they are wont to do, to purchase pardon from men in order to propitiate God; and also that we need not be afraid of those degenerate ministers, <span class="cite-ref">(147)</span> who desire to domineer tyrannically in virtue of their office, although they launch their fulminations against the innocent. </p><p>It is plain, however, that Balaam’s obedience to God’s command does not proceed from the heart. His words, indeed, might deceive the simple, from their appearance of humility; “I will not go, because God forbids it; “but there is no doubt but that, led as he was to gratify them by ambition and by avarice, he indicates that he would be disposed to undertake the journey, unless he were forbidden by God. If his heart had been sincere, the honest reply he should have given was obvious, viz., that it was vain to send either for himself or any one else, in order that Balak might resist the inviolable decree of God. If he had thus heartily and unequivocally given glory to God, another embassy would not have been sent to him; but by his faltering excuse he appeared to inflame the desire of the foolish king, in order to sell his curse at a higher price; for we know that this is the usual way with impostors, that they obtain higher pay for themselves in proportion to the difficulty of the matter. Still, however, if we compare the mercenary prophets of the Pope with Balaam, his servile and enforced submission will deserve no little praise by the side of their detestable and indomitable folly, who, in despite of God, hesitate not to burst forth in impious curses. The truth, which they oppugn, is conspicuous: that terrible judgment, which (God) denounces by the mouth of Isaiah, rings in their ears, “Woe unto them that put darkness for light, and light for darkness,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_5:20</span>;) nevertheless they proceed, and in their brutal madness vomit forth their blasphemies not only to the destruction of the Church, but, if it were possible, to the extinction of all religion. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(147)</span> “Les ministres masques;” the masked ministers. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
