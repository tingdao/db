<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>And he greatly increased his people </em>The singular favor of God towards his Church is now commended by the additional circumstance, that within a short space of time, the chosen people increased beyond the common proportion. In this matter the wonderful blessing of God was strikingly displayed. So much the more offensive then is the barking of some dogs, who insolently scoff at the account given by Moses of the multiplying of the people, because it goes far beyond what takes place in the ordinary course of things. Had the people increased only at the common rate, these persons would have immediately objected, that therein no work of God was to be seen. Thus the object which they pursue by their cavillings is nothing else than to make it to be believed, that the blessing of God had no connection with the case. But we, who are persuaded that it is unwarrantable for us to measure God’s power according to our own understandings, or according to what happens by the common law of nature, reverently admire this extraordinary work of his hand. The subsequent clause is a little obscure, especially if we read, <em>The people were strengthened; </em><span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> for the prophet does not seem to refer to that period when the Israelites lived at ease and in prosperity, but to the time when they were contemptuously and barbarously dealt with as slaves. We may, however, understand the language as spoken by anticipation, — as pointing to what was to happen. In the following verse, it is affirmed, that the Egyptians having changed their mind, began to treat the people with cruelty. Although then the Egyptians did not as yet openly exercise their cruelty against the people, when they were increasing both in number and strength, yet the prophet calls them persecutors. It is certain, that the Israelites, even when they were oppressed as slaves, were a terror to their enemies; and Moses plainly affirms, (<span class="bvs">Exo_1:12</span>) that when they were under tyranny and wrongful oppression, it was still abundantly manifest, that the blessing of God rested upon them. </p><p><strong>(220)</strong> “The root <span class="lang he-il">עצם</span>,” says Phillips, “signifies <em>to be strong, </em>not only with regard to physical force, but also with respect to number: <span class="bvs">Psa_38:20</span>, etc.; in German, a great number is called <em class="lang de-de">eine starke Anzahl </em><em>, a strong number. </em>Number seems to be referred to in this passage.” </p></div>
