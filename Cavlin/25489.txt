<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_12:29</span><strong>.</strong><em>And be not lifted on high </em><span class="cite-ref">(460)</span> This clause corresponds to the last sentence in the passage taken from Matthew, Be <em>not anxious about tomorrow </em>Our Lord now charges them with another fault. When men wish to make arrangements in their own favor, they would willingly embrace five centuries. <span class="cite-ref">(461)</span> The verb <span class="lang el-gr">μετεωρίζεσθαι</span><em>, </em>which Luke employs, properly signifies <em>to survey from a lofty situation, </em>or, as we commonly say, to make long discourses: <span class="cite-ref">(462)</span> for the intemperate desires of the flesh are never satisfied without making a hundred revolutions of heaven and earth. The consequence is, that they leave no room for the providence of God. This is a reproof of excessive curiosity; for it leads us to bring upon ourselves uneasiness to no purpose, and voluntarily to make ourselves miserable <em>before the time, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_8:29</span>.) The expression used by Matthew, <em>its own affliction is sufficient for the day, </em>directs believers to moderate their cares, and not to attempt to carry their foresight beyond the limits of their calling: For, as we have said, it does not condemn every kind of care, but only that which wanders, by indirect and endless circuits, beyond limits. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(460)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne soyez en suspens</span>;” — “be not in suspense.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(461)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Embrasseroyent volontiers beaucoup de cent annees</span>;” — “would willingly embrace many hundreds of years.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(462)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Regarder en haut, et estendre sa veue bien loin: ce qu'on dit communement, Faire de longs discours, ou estre en suspens</span><em class="lang fr-fr">, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">comme aussi nous l’avons traduit</span>.” — “To look from on high, and to extend one’s view very far: as we commonly say, To make long discourses, or <em>to be in suspense, </em>as we have also translated it.” </p></div></div>
