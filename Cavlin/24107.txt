<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>52.</strong><em>Put thy sword again into its place. </em>By these words, Christ confirms the precept of the Law, which forbids private individuals to use the sword. And above all, we ought to attend to the threatening of punishment which is immediately added; for men did not, at their own pleasure, appoint this punishment for avenging their own blood; but God himself, by severely prohibiting murder, has declared how dearly he loves mankind. First, then, he does not choose to be defended by force and violence, because God in the Law forbade men to strike. This is a general reason; and he immediately descends to a special reason. </p><p>But here a question arises. Is it never lawful to use violence in repelling unjust violence? For though Peter had to deal with wicked and base robbers, still he is condemned for <em>having drawn his sword. </em>If, in such a case of moderate defense, an exception was not allowed, Christ appears to tie up the hands of all. Though we have treated this question more copiously <span class="cite-ref">(218)</span> under <span class="bvs">Mat_5:39</span>, yet I shall now state my opinion again in a few words. First, we must make a distinction between a civil court and the court of conscience; <span class="cite-ref">(219)</span> for if any man resist a robber, <span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> he will not be liable to public punishment, because the laws arm him against one who is the common enemy of mankind. Thus, in every case when defense is made against unjust violence, the punishment which God enjoins earthly judges to carry into execution ceases. And yet it is not the mere goodness of the cause that acquits the conscience from guilt, unless there be also pure affection. So then, in order that a man may properly and lawfully defend himself, he must first lay aside excessive wrath, and hatred, and desire of revenge, and all irregular sallies of passion, that nothing tempestuous may mingle with the defense. As this is of rare occurrence, or rather, as it scarcely ever happens, Christ properly reminds his people of the general rule, that they should entirely abstain from using <em>the sword. </em></p><p>But there are fanatics who have foolishly misapplied this passage, so as to wrest the sword out of the hands of judges. They contend that it is unlawful to strike with <em>the sword. </em>This I acknowledge to be true, for no man is at liberty to take <em>the sword </em>at his own pleasure, so as to commit murder; but I deny that magistrates—who are God’s ministers, and by whom he executes his judgments—ought to be viewed as belonging to the ordinary rank. And not only so, but by these words of Christ, this very power is expressly ascribed to them: for when he declares that murderers must be put to death, it follows, that <em>the sword </em>is put into the hands of judges, that they may take vengeance for unjust murders. It will sometimes happen, indeed, that men addicted to the shedding of blood are punished by other means; but this is the ordinary way in which the Lord determined that the fierce cruelty of wicked men should be restrained from rioting with impunity. Certain doctors of what is called Canon Law have ventured to proceed to such a pitch of impudence as to teach, that <em>the sword </em>was not taken from Peter, but he was commanded to keep it sheathed until the time came for drawing it; and hence we perceive how grossly and shamefully those dogs have sported with the word of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(218)</span><em>Harmony, </em>vol. 1, p. 298 </p><p><span class="cite-note">(219)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Entre la jurisdiction externe ou civile, et le jugement spirituel, qui a son siege en la conscience</span>;” — “between external or civil jurisdiction, and the spiritual judgment, which has its seat in the conscience.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(220)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si quelqu’un use de violence pour repousser un brigand</span>;” — “if any one use violence for repelling a robber.” </p></div></div>
