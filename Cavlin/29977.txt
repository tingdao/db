<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Are they not all, etc. </em>That the comparison might appear more clearly, he now mentions what the condition of angels is. For calling them <em>spirits, </em>he denotes their eminence; for in this respect they are superior to corporal creatures. But the office (<span class="lang el-gr">λειτουργία</span>) which he immediately mentions reduces them to their own rank, as it is that which is the reverse of dominion; and this he still more distinctly states, when he says, that they are sent to <em>minister. </em>The first word means the same, as though ale had said, that they were officials; but to <em>minister </em>imports what is more humble and abject. <span class="cite-ref">(27)</span> The service which God allots to angels is indeed honorable; but the very fact that they serve, shows that they are far inferior to Christ, who is the Lord of all. </p><p>If any one objects and says, that Christ is also called in many places both a servant and a minister, not only to God, but also to men, the reply may be readily given; his being a servant was not owing to his nature, but to a voluntary humility, as Paul testifies, (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>;) and at the same time his sovereignty remained to his nature; but angels, on the other hand, were created for this end, — that they might serve, and to minister is what belongs to their condition. The difference then is great; for what is natural to them is, as it were, adventitious or accidental to Christ, because he took our flesh; and what necessarily belongs to them, he of his own accord undertook. Besides, Christ is a minister in such a way, that though he is in our flesh nothing is diminished from the majesty of his dominion. <span class="cite-ref">(28)</span></p><p>From this passage the faithful receive no small consolation; for they hear that celestial hosts are assigned to them as ministers, in order to secure their salvation. It is indeed no common pledge of God’s love towards us, that they are continually engaged in our behalf. Hence also proceeds a singular confirmation to our faith, that our salvation being defended by such guardians, is beyond the reach of danger. Well then has God provided for our infirmities by giving us such assistants to oppose Satan, and to put forth their power in every way to defend us! </p><p>But this benefit he grants especially to his chosen people; hence that angels may minister to us, we must be the members of Christ. Yet some testimonies of Scripture may on the other hand be adduced, to show that angels are sometimes sent forth for the sake of the reprobate; for mention is made by Daniel of the angels of the Persians and the Greeks. (<span class="bvs">Dan_10:20</span>.) But to this I answer, that they were in such a way assisted by angels, that the Lord might thus promote the salvation of his own people; for their success and their victories had always a reference to the benefit of the Church. This is certain, that as we have been banished by sin from God’s kingdom, we can have no communion with angels except through the reconciliation made by Christ; and this we may see by the ladder shown in a vision to the patriarch Jacob. </p><p><strong>(27)</strong> There is no doubt a distinction between the two words here used, but not exactly that which is intimated; the first<span class="lang el-gr">, λειτουργικὰ </span> refers to an official appointment; and the other<span class="lang el-gr">, διακονίαν, </span> to the work which was to be done. Angels are said to be officially appointed, and they are thus appointed for the purpose of doing service to the heirs of salvation; “Are they not all ministrant (or ministerial) spirits, sent forth for service, on account<span class="lang el-gr">διὰ </span> of those who are to inherit salvation?” Then they are spirits, having a special office allotted them, being sent forth to do service in behalf of those who are heirs of salvation. It hence appears that they have a special appointment for this purpose See <span class="bvs">Act_5:19</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(28)</strong> See Appendix E. </p></div>
