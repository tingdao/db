<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here especially commemorates the singular kindness of God, by which he had testified his paternal favor towards his Church. He then says, that <em>signs </em>and <em>wonders </em>had been done by him in <em>the land of Egypt, </em>that: is, for the sake of his people. For why were so many miracles done, except to prove the care he had for his chosen people, and thus to confirm his covenant? We hence see that God’s favor towards the children of Abraham is here set forth, that is, when he refers to the signs and wonders </p><p>which had been done in the land of Egypt. And he adds, <em>and in Israel </em>He extols not only God’s power in miracles, but especially the mercy with which he favored his chosen people. He says also, <em>to this day </em>Not that God performed miracles in every age, but he means that they were worthy of being perpetually remembered, and throughout all ages. Then this refers to the remembrance and celebration of God’s power, when the Prophet says, <em>to this day </em>God, indeed, performed miracles at a certain time, but he performed them that they might be remembered in all ages, and that posterity might acknowledge how wonderfully God had dwelt with their fathers. <span class="cite-ref">(66)</span></p><p>As then the power which he manifested in Egypt was worthy of being remembered, miracles are said to have been done <em>to this day; </em>and they are said to have been done <em>in Israel, </em>because it was God’s purpose to prove the certainty of his faithfulness when he redeemed his people as he had promised. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>and among men </em>The Prophet goes on still further. After he had spoken of the redemption of the people, he intimates that wherever he turned himself, he observed and admired the evidences of God’s power, as though he had said, “O Lord, thou hast indeed given peculiar testimonies as to thy wonderful power and goodness; the redemption of thy people was a singular work, and ought to be commemorated through all ages; but wherever we turn ourselves, there is no corner in the whole world where some miracles do not appear, which ought to lead us to celebrate thy praises.” We hence see that the Prophet proceeds from what is particular to what is general: after having considered God’s power and goodness in the redemption of his people, he extended his thoughts to all parts of the world, and contemplated God’s miracles everywhere. And this is what often occurs in Scripture; after having been reminded of some particular instance of divine power or grace, we are carried away so that we make a transition to what is general. And he adds, <em>and thou hast made thee, </em>or acquired to thyself, <em>a name according to this day; </em>that is, thou hast made thy name to be perpetual, as its glory still at this day shines forth before our eyes. Then the Prophet means that God had so wonderfully manifested his power, that the knowledge of it would be perpetual, and could never be buried by the ingratitude of men. </p><p><strong>(66)</strong> This is commonly the meaning given to this verse. It may be rendered as follows, — </p><p><strong>20.</strong>Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, <em>To before signs and wonders </em>to this day Both to Israel and to mankind; And hast made to thyself a name, Such as it is at this day. </p><p>They were “signs” or evidences of God’s power, and in their character “wonders,” that is, supernatural. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
