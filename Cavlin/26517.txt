<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>Whom the Father hath sanctified. </em>There is a <em>sanctification </em>that is common to all believers. But here Christ claims for himself something far more excellent, namely, that he alone was separated from all others, that the power of the Spirit and the majesty of God might be displayed in him; as he formerly said, that <em>him hath God the Father sealed</em>, (<span class="bvs">Joh_6:27</span>.) But this refers strictly to the person of Christ, so far as he is manifested in the flesh. Accordingly, these two things are joined, that he has been <em>sanctified and sent into the world. </em>But we must also understand for what reason and on what condition <em>he was sent </em>It was to bring salvation from God, and to prove and exhibit himself, in every possible way, to be <em>the Son of God. </em></p><p><em>Do you say that I blaspheme? </em>The Arians anciently tortured this passage to prove that Christ is not God by nature, but that he possesses a kind of borrowed Divinity. But this error is easily refuted, for Christ does not now argue what he is in himself, but what we ought to acknowledge him to be, from his miracles in human flesh. For we can never comprehend his eternal Divinity, unless we embrace him as a Redeemer, so far as the Father hath exhibited him to us. Besides, we ought to remember what I have formerly suggested, that Christ does not, in this passage, explain fully and distinctly what he is, as he would have done among his disciples; but that he rather dwells on refuting the slander of his enemies. </p></div>
