<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Why doth the wicked despise God? </em>It is, indeed, superfluous to bring arguments before God, for the purpose of persuading him to grant us what we ask; but still he permits us to make use of them, and to speak to him in prayer, as familiarly as a son speaks to an earthly father. It should always be observed, that the use of praying is, that God may be the witness of all our affections; not that they would otherwise be hidden from him, but when we pour out our hearts before him, our cares are hereby greatly lightened, and our confidence of obtaining our requests increases. Thus David, in the present passage, by setting before himself how unreasonable and intolerable it would be for the wicked to be allowed to despise God according to their pleasure, thinking he will never bring them to an account, <span class="cite-ref">(228)</span> was led to cherish the hope of deliverance from his calamities. The word which is here rendered <em>despise, </em>is the same as that which he had used before. Some translate it <em>to provoke, </em>and others <em>to blaspheme. </em>But the signification which I have preferred certainly agrees much better with the context; for when persons take from God the power and office of judging, this is ignominiously to drag him from his throne, and to degrade him, as it were, to the station of a private individual. <span class="cite-ref">(229)</span> Moreover, as David had a little before complained that the ungodly deny the existence of a God, or else imagine him to be constantly asleep, having no care about mankind, so now he complains to the same purpose that they say, <em>God will not require it. </em></p><p><strong>(228)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A leur plaisir n’estimans pas que jamais il les amenast le conte</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(229)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Au rang des hommes</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “To the rank of men.” </p></div>
