<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>We have confidence</em>. By this preface he prepares the way for proceeding to give the instruction, which we shall find him immediately afterwards subjoining. For the confidence which he says he has respecting them, made them much more ready to obey than if he had required obedience from them in a way of doubt or distrust. He says, however, that this hope, which he cherished in reference to them, was founded upon the Lord, inasmuch as it is his to bind their hearts to obedience, and to keep them in it; or by this expression, (as appears to me more probable,) he meant to testify, that it is not his intention to enjoin anything but by the commandment of the Lord. Here, accordingly, he marks out limits for himself as to enjoining, and for them as to obeying — that it should be only in the Lord. <span class="cite-ref">(698)</span> All, therefore, that do not observe this limitation, do to no purpose resort to Paul’s example, with the view of binding the Church and subjecting it to their laws. Perhaps he had this also in view, that the respect which was due to his Apostleship might remain unimpaired among the Thessalonians, however the wicked might attempt to deprive him of the honor that belonged to him; for the prayer which he immediately subjoins tends towards this object. For provided men’s hearts continue to be directed towards <em>love to God, and patient waiting for Christ</em>, other things will be in a desirable state, and Paul declares that he desires nothing else. From this it is manifest, how very far he is from seeking dominion for himself peculiarly. For he is satisfied provided they persevere in love to God, and in the hope of Christ’s coming. In following up with prayer his expression of confidence, <span class="cite-ref">(699)</span> he admonishes us that we must not relax in eagerness of prayer on the ground that we cherish good hope. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(698)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Voyci donc les bournes qu’il limite, et pour soy et pour eux: pour soy, de ne commander rien que par le Seigneur: a eux, de ne rendre obeissance sinon au Seigneur</span>;” — “Mark then the limits which he prescribes both for himself and for them: for himself, not to command anything but by the Lord: for them, not to render obedience except to the Lord.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(699)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand apres auoir protesté de sa confiance, il ne laisse pas d’adiouster encore la priere auec la confiance</span>;” — “When after having declared his confidence, he omits not to add besides, prayer along with confidence.” </p></div></div>
