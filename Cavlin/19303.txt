<div class="comment-content"><p>As to the words which follow, <em>Why shouldest thou be as a man astonished </em>or terrified? I take “terrified” for an uncultivated person, as we say in our language, <em>homme savage </em><span class="cite-ref">(111)</span> It is then added, <em>As a giant who cannot save; </em>that is, a strong helper, but of no skin, who possesses great strength, but fails, because he is rendered useless by his own bulk. And so the Prophet says, that it would be a strange thing, that God should be as a strong man, anxious to bring help and yet should do nothing. </p><p>After having said these things, he subjoins the contrast to which I have referred, <em>But thou art in the midst of us, Jehovah, thy name is called on us, forsake us not </em>We now see that the Prophet dismisses all other reasons and betakes himself to God’s gratuitous covenant only, and recumbs on his mercy. <em>Thou art, </em>he says, <em>in the midst of us </em>God had bound himself by his own compact, for no one else could have bound him. Then he says, <em>Thy name is called on us </em>Could the people boast of anything of their own in being thus called? By no means; but that they were so called depended on a gratuitous covenant. As then the Prophet did cast away every merit in works, and every trust in satisfactions, there remained nothing for him but the promise of God, which was itself founded on the free good pleasure of God. Let us hence learn, whenever we pray to God, not to bring forward our own satisfactions, which are nothing but filthy things, abominable to God, but to allege only his own name and promise, even the covenant, which he has made with us in his only — begotten Son, and confirmed by his blood. </p><p><strong>(111)</strong> The word <span class="lang he-il">נדהם</span>, rendered “astonished,” is only found here; it is evidently a Niphal participle, and rendered, by the <em>Septuagint </em>“sleeping — <span class="lang el-gr">ὑπνῶ</span>,” — by the <em>Vulgate, </em>“wandering — vagus,” — by the <em>Siyriac, </em>“weak — imbecillis,” — by <em>Montanus </em>and <em>Paginius, </em>“astonished.” <em>Parkhurst, </em>after <em>Grotius, </em>derives it from an Arabic verb, which means to “come upon one unexpectedly,” or to overwhelm, and renders it overwhelmed, astonied. It may then be rendered, surprised. <em>Grotius </em>says, that it means a precipitant person, coming to the aid of one in danger, and not capable of delivering him. </p><p>As in the former instance, “the sojourner” and “the traveler” are the same, only what is said of the latter is more specific; so it seems to be here: the man, taken by surprise, is only farther described as one who is not able on that account to save. The two verses may be thus rendered — </p><p><strong>8.</strong>The hope of Israel! his Savior in time of distress! Why art thou like a sojourner in the land? Or like a traveler turning aside to pass the night? </p><p><strong>9.</strong>Why art thou like one taken by surprise — Like a man who is not able to save? Yet thou <em>art </em>in the midst of us, Jehovah; And thy name, on us is it called: Do not forsake us </p><p>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
