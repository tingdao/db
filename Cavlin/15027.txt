<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Therefore pride compasseth them as a chain. </em>This complaint proceeds farther than the preceding; for we are here told that although God sees the ungodly shamefully and wickedly abusing his kindness and clemency, he notwithstanding bears with their ingratitude and rebellion. The Psalmist employs a similitude taken from the dress and attire of the body, to show that such persons glory in their evil deeds. The verb <span class="lang he-il">ענק</span>, <em>anak, </em>which we have rendered, <em>encompasseth them as a chain, </em>comes from a noun which signifies <em>a chain. </em>The language, therefore, implies that the ungodly glory in their audacity and madness, as if they were richly adorned with a chain of gold: <span class="cite-ref">(164)</span> and that violence serves them for raiment, thinking, as they do, that it renders them very stately and honorable. Some translate the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שית</span>,<em>shith, </em>which we have rendered <em>raiment, </em>by <em>buttocks; </em>but this is a sense which the scope of the passage will by no means admit. David, I have no doubt, after having commenced at the neck or head — for the Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">ענק</span>, <em>anak </em>which he uses, signifies also sometimes <em>to crown </em><span class="cite-ref">(165)</span> — now meant to comprehend, in one word, the whole attire of the person. The amount of what is stated is, that the wicked are so blinded with their prosperity, as to become more and more proud and insolent <span class="cite-ref">(166)</span> The Psalmist has very properly put <em>pride </em>first in order, and then added <em>violence </em>to it as its companion; for what is the reason why the ungodly seize and plunder whatever they can get on all sides, and exercise so much cruelty, but because they account all other men as nothing in comparison of themselves; or rather persuade themselves that mankind are born only for them? The source, then, and, as it were, the mother of all violence, is pride. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(164)</span> There is here a metaphorical allusion to the rich collars or chains worn about the necks of great personages for ornament. Compare <span class="bvs">Pro_1:9</span>. <em>Pride compassed </em>these prosperous wicked men <em>about as a chain</em>; they wore it for an ornament as gold chains or collars were worn about the neck; discovering it by their stately carriage. See <span class="bvs">Isa_3:16</span>. Or there may be an allusion to the office which some of them bore; for chains of gold were among the ensigns of magistracy and civil power. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(165)</span> Accordingly, the Chaldee, instead of “compasseth them as a chain.” has “crowneth them as a crown or diadem does the head.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(166)</span> “<em>Violence covereth them as a garment</em>. Wicked men that are prosperous and proud, are generally oppressive to others; and are very often open in their acts of violence, which are as openly done, and to be seen of all men, as the clothes they wear upon their backs; and frequently the clothes they wear are got by rapine and oppression, so that they may properly be called garments of violence. See <span class="bvs">Isa_59:6</span>.” — <em>Dr Gill</em>. </p></div></div>
