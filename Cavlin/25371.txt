<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Eating and drinking those things which they shall give you </em>This is another circumstance expressly mentioned by Luke. By these words Christ not only enjoins them to be satisfied with ordinary and plain food, but allows them to eat at another man’s table. Their plain and natural meaning is: “you will be at liberty to live at the expense of others, so long as you shall be on this journey; for it is proper that those for whose benefit you labor should supply you with food.” Some think that they were intended to remove scruples of conscience, that the disciples might not find fault with any kind of food. <span class="cite-ref">(35)</span> But nothing of this kind was intended, and it was not even his object to enjoin frugality, but merely to permit them to accept of a reward, by living, during this commission, at the expense of those by whom they were entertained. </p><p><strong>(35)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A fin que les disciples ne facent conscience d’aucune sorte de viande</span>;” — “in order that the disciples may not make conscience of any kind of food.” </p></div>
