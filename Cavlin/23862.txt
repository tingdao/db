But though all the three Evangelists have the same object in view, namely, to show that the Jews will dare to act towards the Son in the same manner as they have repeatedly done towards the prophets, Matthew explains the matter more at large, namely, that God, by sending a multitude of prophets, contended with the malice of the priests. <span class="cite-ref">(45)</span> Hence it appears how obstinate their malice was, for the correction of which no remedies were of any avail. <span class="cite-ref">(46)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(45)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Dieu ne s’est point lassé pour la cruauté des sacrificateurs, d’envoyer des prophetes; mais les suscitant comme par troupes, a combatu contre leur malice</span>;” — “That God did not, on account of the cruelty of the priests, fail to send prophets; but raising them up — as it were — in troops, fought against their malice.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(46)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Veu que tous les mayens et remedes que Dieu y a employez n’ont rien servi</span>;” — “since all the means and remedies which God employed for it were of no avail.” </p></div></div>
