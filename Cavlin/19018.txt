<div class="comment-content"><p>Here God promises that he would so provide for the salvation of his people after their return from exile, that they should not again perish. But the cause of God’s vengeance ought to be observed, which is expressed in the fifth chapter of Isaiah, “My people,” he says, “have been led captive, because they had no knowledge; therefore the grave has widened its soul or its throat. <span class="cite-ref">(86)</span> He then says, that the cause of the people’s ruin was, because instruction had ceased among them, and pastors had become mute dogs or robbers. Here, on the other hand, God declares that he would give them faithful pastors, who would discharge in a befitting manner their office. I, indeed, allow, that under this term are included faithful and wise magistrates; but he especially refers to prophets and priests, whose office it is in particular to reform idolatry. <span class="cite-ref">(87)</span></p><p>We hence learn that the Church cannot continue without having faithful pastors to shew the way of salvation. The wellbeing of the Church then is secured, when God raises up true and faithful teachers to proclaim his truth: but when the Church is deprived of sound teachers, all things soon fall into ruin. For God, no doubt, intimates by this promise that he would not only be the deliverer of his people, so as to restore them from exile, but that he would be also their perpetual guardian after the people had returned to their own country. It hence follows, that the Church of God is not only begotten by means of holy and godly pastors, but that its life is also cherished, nourished, and confirmed by them to the end. As it is not enough for civil order to be once set up, except the magistrates continue in their office, so nothing is more ruinous to the Church than for God to take away faithful pastors. It cannot indeed be, that people will return to God, unless prophets be first sent: but God speaks here of a continued course of instruction, and of a well regulated government in the Church, as though he had said, “I will not only give you prophets to lead you from your wanderings to me, and to restore you to the way of salvation, but I will also continually set over you sound and faithful teachers.” But we must notice, that those who preside cannot rightly discharge their office unless they are endued with wisdom. God also intimates his paternal love, when he says, that good pastors would be dear to him. It afterwards follows — </p><p><strong>(86)</strong> Rather, “itself;” for the word often rendered soul, has sometimes this meaning. See note on <span class="bvs">Jer_3:11</span>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(87)</strong><em>Blayney, </em>following the <em>Targum, </em>renders pastors “rulers,” and feed, “rule:” but this is to interpret and not to translate, as the words have never strictly these meanings, though what are sometimes to be understood by pastors are rulers, and by feeding, ruling or governing. But the interpretation in this instance seems not to be correct, and for the reason here assigned by <em>Calvin </em>It is indeed the opinion of <em>Henry, Scott, Adam Clarke, </em>and others, that both civil and ecclesiastical pastors are intended; and if so, “knowledge” may be applied to the latter, and “wisdom” to the former. The <em>Septuagint </em>have omitted “wisdom,” and retain only “knowledge.” The <em>Targum </em>has “knowledge and wisdom;” the <em>Vulgate, “ </em>knowledge and doctrine;” the <em>Syriac, “ </em>knowledge and prudence;” and <em>Blayney, “ </em>knowledge and discretion.” The verb <span class="lang he-il">רעה</span> means “to feed on,“ as in <span class="bvs">Isa_44:20</span>, or, as here, to “feed with.” It means also to “feed itself” as a beast does, <span class="bvs">Isa_11:7</span></p></div>
