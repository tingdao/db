<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Since you are in pursuit of spiritual gifts </em>Paul concludes that the gift of tongues has not been conferred with the view of giving occasion of boasting to a few, without yielding advantage to the Church. “If spiritual gifts,” says he, “delight you, let the end be edification. <em>Then </em>only may you reckon, that you have attained an excellence that is true and praiseworthy — when the Church receives advantage from you. Paul, however, does not hereby give permission to any one to cherish an ambition to excel, even to the benefit of the Church, but by correcting the fault, he shows how far short they come of what they are in pursuit of, and at the same time lets them know who they are that should be most highly esteemed. He would have a man to be held in higher estimation, in proportion as he devotes himself with eagerness to promote edification. In the meantime, it is our part to have this one object in view — that the Lord may be exalted, and that his kingdom may be, from day to day, enlarged. </p><p>The term <em>spirits, </em><span class="cite-ref">(825)</span> he employs here, by metonymy, to denote <em>spiritual gifts, </em>as the <em>spirit </em>of doctrine, or of understanding, or of judgment, is employed to denote spiritual doctrine, or understanding, or judgment. Otherwise we must keep in view what he stated previously, that it is one and the same Spirit, who <em>distributeth to every man </em>various gifts <em>according to his will. </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_12:11</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(825)</span> “<em class="lang fr-fr">Les dons spirituels</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, il y a mot a mot, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">les esprits </em>;” — “<em>Spiritual gifts </em>— it is literally, <em>spirits</em>. ” </p></div></div>
