<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>53.</strong><em>He steadfastly set his face. </em>By this expression Luke has informed us that Christ, when he had death before his eyes, rose above the fear of it, and went forward to meet it; but, at the same time, points out that he had a struggle, and that, having vanquished terror, <span class="cite-ref">(589)</span> he boldly presented himself to die. For if no dread, no difficulty, no struggle, no anxiety, had been present to his mind, what need was there that he should <em>set his face steadfastly? </em><span class="cite-ref">(590)</span> But as he was neither devoid of feeling, nor under the influence of foolish hardihood, he must have been affected by the cruel and bitter death, or rather the shocking and dreadful agony, which he knew would overtake him from the rigorous judgment of God; and so far is this from obscuring or diminishing his glory, that it is a remarkable proof of his unbounded love to us; for laying aside a regard to himself that he might devote himself to our salvation, through the midst of terrors he hastened to death, the time of which he knew to be at hand. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(589)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estans victorieux par dessus ceste frayeur naturelle</span>;” — “being victorious over that natural dread.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(590)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quel besoin estoit il qu’il prinst sa resolution, et par maniere de dire s’obstinast en soy-mesme</span> ?” — “What need was there that he should take his resolution, and, so to speak, persist in his own mind?” </p></div></div>
