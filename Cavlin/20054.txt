But all this would be nothing, as he afterwards tells us he adds, he <em>hath said, I will ascend, I will cover the land, I will destroy the city, etc</em>. He puts city in the singular instead of the plural number; <span class="cite-ref">(134)</span> I <em>will destroy cities, </em>he says, <em>and all who dwell in them. </em>He in short sets forth Pharaoh here as one who triumphed before he fought, because he could cover the land with the multitude of his footmen and horsemen. It now follows, — </p><p><strong>(134)</strong> The <em>city </em>here is put in opposition to the <em>land, </em>— And it (Egypt) said, I will ascend, I will cover the land; I will destroy (every) city, and the dwellers in it. </p></div>
