<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And he said </em>The prophet informs us, by these words, that the people had a feeling sense of their remarkable deliverance from impending destruction, by means of prayer alone, which, for a season, restrained God’s vengeance from bursting forth against them. In a very short time, however, they return to their wonted disposition of mind, a striking proof of the awful perversity of their hearts. To represent how highly God was offended, the prophet says that he had purposed to destroy the transgressors: not that God is subject to human passions, to be very angry for a little, and then immediately afterwards, on being appeased, changes his purpose; for God, in his secret counsel, had resolved upon their forgiveness, even as he actually did pardon them. But the prophet makes mention of another purpose, by which God designed to strike the people with terror, that coming to know and acknowledge the greatness of their sin, they might be humbled on account of it. This is that repentance so frequently referred to in the Scriptures. Not that God is mutable in himself; but he speaks after the manner of <em>men, </em>that we may be affected with a more feeling sense of his wrath: like a king who had resolved to pardon an offender, yet sisted him before his judgment-seat, the more effectually to impress him with the magnitude of the kindness done to him. God, therefore, while he keeps to himself his secret purpose, declared openly to the people that they had committed a trespass which deserved to be punished with eternal death. Next he says that<em>Moses stood in the breach, </em>meaning that he had made intercession with God, lest his awful vengeance might break forth among the people. There is here an allusion to the manner in which cities are stormed; for if a breach is made in the wall by any of the various engines which are employed in war, brave soldiers will instantly throw themselves into the breach to defend it. <span class="cite-ref">(255)</span> Hence Ezekiel reproaches the false prophets, who, unlike Moses, deceiving the people by their flatteries, making, as it were, a mud-wall, do not place themselves in the breach in the day of battle. </p><p>“Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord,” <span class="bvs">Eze_13:5</span>. </p><p>Some expositors are of opinion that the prophet refers to the separation which the people had made among themselves in violating the covenant of God, and the sacred relation in which they stood to each other; but the meaning is the same. For in that breach which gave rise to this metaphor or similitude, God, in defending his people so faithfully, was to them in place of a wall or bulwark. Having provoked him to anger anew, he was about to rush upon them for their destruction, had not Moses interposed as their intercessor. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(255)</span> The sins of the people had opened <em>a breach </em>or <em>gap</em>, for God as an enemy to enter and destroy them. But, like soldiers who stand in the breach that has been made in the walls of a beleaguered city to oppose the irruption of the enemy, Moses, by his earnest prayer, stopped this breach, <span class="bvs">Exo_32:11</span>. “Moses is here mentioned in the character of a mediator, under the figure of one standing in the breach of the wall of a city made by besiegers, to oppose any farther hostile aggressions. The figure of <em>a breach </em>is frequently employed in Scripture to denote some destruction by God. Thus in <span class="bvs">Jud_21:15</span>, God made <em>a breach, </em><span class="lang he-il">פרף</span><em>, </em>in the tribes of Israel, <em>i.e., </em>He destroyed one of the tribes, viz., that of Benjamin: see also <span class="bvs">2Sa_6:8</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_22:30</span>. Hence in this passage we understand that God would have destroyed the Israelites, had not Moses stood in the breach, <em>i.e., </em>interceded by his prayers, just at the time when the divine judgments were about to be executed. The Chaldee has paraphrased it thus, <em>If Moses had not stood before Him and prevailed in prayer</em>, <em>i.e</em>. , arrested the destruction.” — <em>Phillips </em></p></div></div>
