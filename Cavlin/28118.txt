<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>For the law of the Spirit of life, etc. </em>This is a confirmation of the former sentence; and that it may be understood, the meaning of the words must be noticed. Using a language not strictly correct, by the<em>law of the Spirit </em>he designates the Spirit of God, who sprinkles our souls with the blood of Christ, not only to cleanse us from the stain of sin with respect to its guilt, but also to sanctify us that we may be really purified. He adds that it is life-giving, (for the genitive case, after the manner of the Hebrew, is to be taken as an adjective,) it hence follows, that they who detain man in the letter of the law, expose him to death. On the other hand, he gives the name of the <em>law of sin </em>and <em>death </em>to the dominion of the flesh and to the tyranny of death, which thence follows: the law of God is set as it were in the middle, which by teaching righteousness cannot confer it, but on the contrary binds us with the strongest chains in bondage to sin and to death. </p><p>The meaning then is, — that the law of God condemns men, and that this happens, because as long as they remain under the bond of the law, they are oppressed with the bondage of sin, and are thus exposed to death; but that the Spirit of Christ, while it abolishes the law of sin in us by destroying the prevailing desires of the flesh, does at the same time deliver us from the peril of death. If any one objects and says, that then pardon, by which our transgressions are buried, depends on regeneration; to this it may be easily answered, that the reason is not here assigned by Paul, but that the manner only is specified, in which we are delivered from guilt; and Paul denies that we obtain deliverance by the external teaching of the law, but intimates that when we are renewed by the Spirit of God, we are at the same time justified by a gratuitous pardon, that the curse of sin may no longer abide on us. The sentence then has the same meaning, as though Paul had said, that the grace of regeneration is never disjoined from the imputation of righteousness. </p><p>I dare not, with some, take <em>the law of sin and death </em>for the law of God, because it seems a harsh expression. For though by increasing sin it generates death, yet Paul before turned aside designedly from this invidious language. At the same time I no more agree in opinion with those who explain the law of sin as being the lust of the flesh, as though Paul had said, that he had become the conqueror of it. But it will appear very evident shortly, as I think, that he speaks of a gratuitous absolution, which brings to us tranquillizing peace with God. I prefer retaining the word <em>law</em>, rather than with [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>] to render it <em>right </em>or <em>power: </em>for Paul did not without reason allude to the law of God. <span class="cite-ref">(238)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(238)</span><em>Ca1vin </em>has, in his exposition of this verse, followed [<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>], and the same view has been taken by [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>], [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>], [<span class="bvs">Vitringa </span>], [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>], [<span class="bvs">Scott </span>], and [<span class="bvs">Chalmers </span>]. But [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>], following [<span class="bvs">Ambrose </span>], has taken another view, which [<span class="bvs">Haldane </span>] has strongly advocated, and with considerable power of reasoning, though, as some may perhaps think, unsuccessfully. The exposition is this, — “The law of the spirit of life” is the law of faith, or the gospel, which is the ministration of the Spirit; and “the spirit of life” means either the life-giving spirit, or the spirit which conveys the life which is in Christ Jesus. Then “the law of sin and death” is the moral law, so called because it discloses sin and denounces death. It is said that this view corresponds with the “no condemnation” in the first verse, and with the word “law” in the verse which follows, which is no doubt the moral law, and with the truth which the verse exhibits. It is also added that freedom or deliverance from the law of sin, viewed as the power of sin, is inconsistent with the latter part of the former chapter; and that the law of faith, which through the Spirit conveys life, makes us free from the moral law as the condition of life, is the uniform teaching of Paul. “This freedom,” says [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>], “is ascribed to God, to Christ, and to the Gospel, — to God as the author, <span class="bvs">Rom_7:25</span>, — to Christ as the mediator, — and to the Gospel as the instrument: and the manner of this deliverance is more clearly explained in the verse which follows.” </p></div></div>
