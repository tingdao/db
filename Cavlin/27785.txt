<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And herein do I study. </em>There is no sharper prick to prick men forward, with all desire to lead a godly and holy life, than the hope of the last resurrection, as the Scripture teacheth in many places. Therefore, when Paul will effectually exhort the people anywhere, he calleth them back to remember the same ( <span class="bvs">Phi_3:20</span>). Wherefore, it is not without cause that he saith in this place, that staying himself upon this faith, he hath endeavored to live purely before God, and righteously among men. And surely an evil conscience is as good as a thousand witnesses to accuse<span class="cite-ref">(586)</span> men of blockishness, that they may gather for a certainty that they do not earnestly and thoroughly believe eternal life, after which they never long. He calleth it a conscience, <span class="lang el-gr">απροσκοπον</span>, that is, without offense, where the servants of God labor to remove all lets which hinder their course. And he putteth two parts of the conscience. For there is a certain inward sense or feeling which beholdeth<span class="cite-ref">(587)</span> God alone, and thence cometh faithfulness and integrity which we use towards men. At length, when he saith that he hath constantly followed as well godliness in worshipping God, as just dealing among men, he signifieth unto us that those do indeed hope for the last resurrection who are never weary of well-doing. For this word always doth signify perseverance in a straight course.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(586)</span></p><p>“ Ad coarguendos,” to convict. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(587)</span></p><p>“ Respicit,” has repect to. </p></div></div>
