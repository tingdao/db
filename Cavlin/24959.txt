<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>65.</strong><em>And fear fell upon all </em>This fear mentioned by Luke proceeded from a feeling of the divine power: for the works of God ought to be contemplated by us with such reverence as to affect our minds with seriousness. <span class="cite-ref">(66)</span> God does not amuse us with his miracles, but arouses the senses of men, which he perceives to be in a dormant state. <span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> Luke says also that the report of those things was circulated <em>in all the mountainous district of Judea </em>And yet many derived no advantage from the temporary impression of the power of God: for, when John began to exercise his office as an instructor, there were few that remembered what wonders had attended his birth. It was not merely, however, for the sake of those who heard them, that God determined to spread abroad the report of those events, but to establish, in all ages, the certainty of the miracle, which was then universally known. Meanwhile, a general mirror of human ingratitude is here placed before our eyes: for, while trifling and frivolous occurrences remain firmly in our minds, those which ought to produce a constant recollection of divine favors immediately fade and disappear. </p><p>Luke does not speak of stupid men, or actual despisers of God: for he says that they <em>put them in their heart: </em>that is, they applied eagerly to the consideration of them. Some probably continued to remember, but the greater part rapidly shook off the fear which they had experienced. It deserves our notice that they were far from mistaking the design, when they interpreted the miracles which they saw as relating to the future excellence of the child: for such, we have said, was the design of God, that John should afterwards come forth with the highest reputation. <em>And the hand of the Lord was with him </em>The meaning is, that the grace of God was strikingly visible in many respects, and showed manifestly that he was not an ordinary person. It is a figurative mode of expression, and denotes that the power of God was as fully manifested as if his hand had been visibly seen, so that all readily acknowledged the presence of God. </p><p><strong>(66)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que nous en soyons touchez et esmeus a bon escient</span>.” — “That we may be touched and moved by them in good earnest.” </p><p><strong>(67)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Dieu en faisant miracles ne se joue point pour nous servir de passe- temps, mais reveille nos sens, lesquels il voit estre abrutis et en dormis</span>.” — “God, in working miracles, does not amuse himself to supply us with pastime, but arouses our senses, which he sees to be stupified and asleep.” </p></div>
