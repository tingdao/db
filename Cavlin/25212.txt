<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And fear seized all </em>A sense of the divine presence must have brought <em>fear </em>along with it: but there is a difference between the kinds <em>of fear </em>Unbelievers either tremble and are dismayed; or, struck with alarm, murmur against God: while devout and godly persons, moved by reverence, willingly humble themselves. <em>Fear, </em>therefore, is here taken in a good sense, because they gave the honor which was due to the power of God which they had beheld, and rendered to God not only homage, but thanksgiving. </p><p><em>God hath visited his people </em>I understand this to refer not to every kind of <em>visitation, </em>but to that which would restore them to their original condition. Not only were the affairs of Judea in a depressed state, but they had sunk under a wretched and frightful slavery, as if God were not looking at them. The only remaining hope was, that God had promised to be their Redeemer, after they had endured very heavy calamities. I have no doubt, therefore, that they were excited by the miracle to expect an approaching restoration to prosperity: only they fall into a mistake as to the nature of the <em>visitation </em>Though they acknowledge and celebrate the unwonted grace of God in this respect, that <em>a great Prophet hath risen up among us, </em>yet this eulogium comes very far short of the dignity and glory of the promised Messiah. Hence it appears that the faith of that people was, at this time, exceedingly confused, and involved in many unfounded imaginations. </p></div>
