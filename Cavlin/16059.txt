<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>160.</strong><em>The beginning of thy word is truth. </em>The design of the Prophet it is not difficult to perceive; but the words admit of being understood in two ways. Some interpret the noun <em>beginning </em>as denoting that the truth of God shines forth conspicuously in his word, immediately when we enter for the first time upon the study of it, so that this entrance may justly be called the beginning of the word. This sentence contains the profitable doctrine, that if we are finished with eyes of understanding, we will no sooner cast our eyes upon heavenly doctrine than the truth of it will meet our view. Others, however, give a different explanation, and perhaps with no less propriety, eliciting this sense, That the word of God has been from the beginning certain and infallible truth, and will continue so even to the end. These two clauses hang very well together â€” that God has been true to his word from the beginning, and that he will continue to be so everlastingly and immutably. The interpretation which refers the word<em>judgment </em>to the works of God and not to his doctrine, I would not altogether condemn, yet it is not in harmony with the context. Let us then retain this sense, That from the time when God began to speak he has always been faithful to his promises, and has never disappointed the hope of his people; and that the course of this faithfulness has been so uniform, that from the beginning even to the end his word is true and faithful. </p></div>
