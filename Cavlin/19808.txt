<div class="comment-content"><p>Here Jeremiah only relates that he had delivered the message committed to him; and here is seen the Prophet’s magnanimity, for as it appeared yesterday, he was an unwelcome messenger; and though there was danger, yet Jeremiah performed his office, for he knew that God would not suffer the king to do anything to him unless it were for some benefit. There is then no doubt but that he deposited his life in God’s hand, and offered himself, as it were, a sacrifice, when he dared openly to threaten the king, which could not have been done without offending him; and </p><p>“the wrath of a king,” as Solomon says, <LineBreak />“is the messenger of death.” (<span class="bvs">Pro_16:14</span>) </p><p>Here, then, the firmness of the Prophet is deserving of praise; for he dreaded no danger when he saw that necessity was laid on him by God. </p></div>
