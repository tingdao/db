<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_8:18</span><em>And when Jesus had seen great multitudes about him. </em>Matthew, I have no doubt, touches briefly what the others explain in a more ample and copious narrative. The other two state a circumstance, which is not noticed by Matthew that Christ withdrew privately, for the sake of retirement, <em>into a desert place, </em>before it was daylight. Mark afterwards says, that Peter informed him, <em>all seek, thee; </em>and Luke says, that <em>multitudes </em>came to that place. Again, Matthew says, that <em>he passed over to the other side, </em>while the other two say, that he passed <em>through all Galilee, </em>to preach in every place. But <em>the other side, </em>or, <em>the farther bank, ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">τὸ πέραν</span>,) does not, I think, denote what was strictly the opposite side, but refers to that curvature of the lake, which was below Capernaum. In this way, he crossed over to another part of the lake, and yet did not go out of Galilee. </p></div>
