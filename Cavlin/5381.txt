<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>But he shall not multiply horses. </em>The royal power is here circumscribed within certain limits, lest it should exalt itself too much in reliance on the glory of its dignity, <span class="cite-ref">(70)</span> For we know how insatiable are the desires of kings, inasmuch as they imagine that all things are lawful to them. Therefore, although the royal dignity may be splendid, God would not have it to be the pretext of unrestrained power, but restricts and limits it to legal bounds. <span class="cite-ref">(71)</span><span class="lang he-il">רק</span>, <em>rak</em>, is an adversative particle which some construe <em>only; </em>almost with the same meaning, because this exception was added to restrain the passions of their kings. The first prohibition is, that he should not collect for himself a multitude of horses; but, since it is twice repeated, we must consider why it is so. Many thus translate it, “He shall not multiply horses, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to multiply horses;” but this manner of speaking is harsh and obscure. Now, since the particle <span class="lang he-il">למען</span><em>lemagnan, </em>signifies “for the sake of (<em>propter</em>)<em>, </em>it may be properly translated to the letter, “for the sake of multiplying <em>horses, </em>” (<em>propter multiplicare, vel propter ad multiplicandum.</em>) I have no doubt, then, but that God condemns an immoderate number of horses from the consequences which might ensue; because it might excite the minds of the kings rashly to undertake expeditions against the Egyptians. This, therefore, I consider to be the genuine meaning, that the king should not provide himself with horses in too great numbers, lest, when he was in possession of many horses, he should lead his army into Egypt. Thus, amongst other evils which might arise from a multitude of horses, Moses mentions this, that the king’s mind will be puffed up with pride, so as to invade Egypt with an army of horse. Now, the question is, why God forbade His people to return by that way? Some explain it, that the horses would be brought contrary to God’s command, who had forbidden them to trade (with that people;) <span class="cite-ref">(72)</span> but this does not seem appropriate. Others think that the people were prohibited from passing the desert, lest in their curiosity they should be ungrateful to God; but this, too, is far-farfetched. To me it seems probable, that this journey was prohibited them, in order that, being mindful of their deliverance, they should be content with their own boundaries. They had been rescued from a thousand deaths: if they had voluntarily gone thither to provoke an adversary, their confidence would have been a sign of their despising and forgetting God’s grace. Therefore, in order that the recollection of their redemption should be deeply impressed upon their minds, God would have the honor put upon His miracles, that they should avoid those regions like the abysses of death. Unless perhaps this reason may be preferred, that a handle for those wicked alliances was cut off, which we see were audaciously contracted, because the kings of Israel gloried in the abundance of their cavalry. But the former explanation is most suitable. This law, however, was not obeyed by their best kings; and hence it appears that the wilfulness and pride of their kings could scarcely be repressed by any restraints. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(70)</span> Addition in <em>Fr, </em>“<span class="lang fr-fr">Et face du cheval eschappe</span>;” and act like a runaway horse </p><p><span class="cite-note">(71)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le mot que nous avons translate </span><em class="lang fr-fr">au reste </em> ” In the Latin, <em>verum </em>; <em>A.
