<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>69.</strong><em>He hath raised up the horn of salvation </em>That is, saving power: <span class="cite-ref">(71)</span> for, when the throne of David was cast down, and the people scattered, the hope of salvation had to all appearance perished. Zacharias alludes to the predictions of the prophets, which hold out that a sudden revival would take place, when the state of affairs should have become melancholy and desperate. This mode of expression is borrowed from the passage, </p><p>“There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_132:17</span>.) </p><p>But if it is only in Christ that God has put forth his power to save us<em>, </em>we are not at liberty to depart from that method, if we desire to obtain salvation from God. Let it be also observed, that this <em>horn </em>brings <em>salvation </em>to believers, but terror to the ungodly, whom it scatters, or bruises and lays prostrate. </p><p><em>Of his servant David </em>He is so denominated, not only because, like any one of the godly, he worshipped God, but for this other reason, that he was his chosen servant to rule and save his people, and thus to represent, along with his successors, the person and office of Christ. Though there remained among the Jews, at that time, no trace of a kingdom, Zacharias, resting on the promises of God, does not hesitate to call David the <em>servant </em>of God, in whom God gave an example of the salvation which was to come. <span class="cite-ref">(72)</span> Now that the throne of Christ is erected amongst us, that thence he may govern us, it follows that he is actually appointed to us the author of salvation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(71)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C'est a dire, une vertu et puissance pleine de salut</span>.” — “That is, a power and might full of salvation </p><p><span class="cite-note">(72)</span> “Specimen futurae salutis;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">pource que Dieu l'avoit dresse pour figure et tesmoignage du salut a venir</span>;” — “because God had set him up for a figure and proof of the salvation to come.” </p></div></div>
