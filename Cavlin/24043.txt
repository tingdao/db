<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Come, you blessed of my Father. </em>We must remember Christ’s design; for he bids his disciples rest satisfied now with hope, that they may with patience and tranquillity of mind look for the enjoyment of the heavenly kingdom; and next, he bids them strive earnestly, and not become wearied in the right course. To this latter clause he refers, when he promises the inheritance of the heavens to none but those who by good works aim at the prize of the heavenly calling. But before speaking of the reward of good works, he points out, in passing, that the commencement of salvation flows from a higher source; for by calling them <em>blessed of the Father, </em>he reminds them, that their salvation proceeded from the undeserved favor of God. Among the Hebrews the phrase <em>blessed of God </em>means one who is <em>dear to God, </em>or <em>beloved by God. </em>Besides, this form of expression was not only employed by believers to extol the grace of God towards men, but those who had degenerated from true godliness still held this principle. <em>Enter, thou blessed of God, </em>said Laban to Abraham’s servant, (<span class="bvs">Gen_24:31</span>.) We see that nature suggested to them this expression, by which they ascribed to God the praise of all that they possessed. There can be no doubt, therefore, that Christ, in describing the salvation of the godly, begins with the undeserved love of God, by which those who, under the guidance of the Spirit in this life, aim at righteousness, were predestined to life. </p><p>To this also relates what he says shortly afterwards, that <em>the kingdom, </em>to the possession of which they will be appointed at the last day, <em>had been prepared for them from the beginning of the world. </em>For though it may be easy to object, that the reward was laid up with a view to their future merits, any person who will candidly examine the words must acknowledge that there is an implied commendation of the grace of God. Nay more, Christ does not simply invite believers to possess <em>the kingdom, </em>as if they had obtained it by their merits, but expressly says that it is bestowed on them as heirs. </p><p>Yet we must observe another object which our Lord had in view. For though the life of the godly be nothing else than a sad and wretched banishment, so that the earth scarcely bears them; though they groan under hard poverty, and reproaches, and other afflictions; yet, that they may with fortitude and cheerfulness surmount these obstacles, the Lord declares that a <em>kingdom </em>is elsewhere <em>prepared for them. </em>It is no slight persuasive to patience, when men are fully convinced that they do not run in vain; and therefore, lest our minds should be east, down by the pride of the ungodly, in which they give themselves unrestrained indulgences—lest our hope should even be weakened by our own afflictions, let us always remember the inheritance which awaits us in heaven; for it depends on no uncertain event, but was <em>prepared for us </em>by God before we were born<em>, </em>—<em>prepared, </em>I say, for each of the elect, for the persons here addressed by Christ are the <em>blessed of the Father. </em></p><p>When it is here said only that <em>the kingdom was prepared from the beginning of the world, </em>while it is said, in another passage, that it was prepared before the creation of heaven and of earth, (<span class="bvs">Eph_1:4</span>) this involves no inconsistency. For Christ does not here fix the precise time when the inheritance of eternal life was appointed for the sons of God, but only reminds us of God’s fatherly care, with which he embraced us before we were born; and confirms the certainty of our hope by this consideration, that our life can sustain no injury from the commotions and agitations of the world. </p></div>
