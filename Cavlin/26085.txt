<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>Andrew, Simon Peterâ€™s brother. </em>The design of the Evangelist, down to the end of the chapter, is to inform us how gradually the disciples were brought to Christ. Here he relates about Peter, and afterwards he will mention Philip and Nathanael. The circumstance of <em>Andrew </em>immediately bringing his brother expresses the nature of faith, which does not conceal or quench the light, but rather spreads it in every direction. <em>Andrew </em>has scarcely a spark, and yet, by means of it, he enlightens his brother. Woe to our indolence, therefore, if we do not, after having been fully enlightened, endeavor to make others partakers of the same grace. We may observe in <em>Andrew </em>two things which Isaiah requires from the children of God; namely, that each should take his neighbor by the hand, and next, that he should say, </p><p>Come, let us go up into the mountain of the Lord,<LineBreak />and he will teach us, (<span class="bvs">Isa_2:3</span>.) </p><p>For Andrew stretches out the hand to his brother, but at the same time he has this object in view, that he may become a fellow-disciple with him in the school of Christ. We ought also to observe the purpose of God, which determined that <em>Peter, </em>who was to be far more eminent, was brought to the knowledge of Christ by the agency and ministry of Andrew; that none of us, however excellent, may refuse to be taught by an inferior; for that man will be severely punished for his peevishness, or rather for his pride, who, through his contempt of a man, will not deign to come to Christ. </p></div>
