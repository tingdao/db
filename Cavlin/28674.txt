<div class="comment-content"><p>He now proves that <em>prophecy, </em>and other gifts of that nature, are done away, <span class="cite-ref">(798)</span> because they are conferred upon us to help our infirmity. Now our imperfection will one day have an end. Hence the use, even of those gifts, will, at the same time, be discontinued, for it were absurd that they should remain and be of no use. They will, therefore, perish. This subject he pursues to the end of the chapter. </p><p><strong>9.</strong><em>We know in part </em>This passage is misinterpreted by most persons, as if it meant that our knowledge, and in like manner our prophecy, is not yet perfect, but that we are daily making progress in them. Paul’s meaning, however, is — that it is owing to our imperfection that we at present have knowledge and prophecy. Hence the phrase <em>in part </em>means — “Because we are not yet perfect.” Knowledge and prophecy, therefore, have place among us so long as that imperfection cleaves to us, to which they are helps. It is true, indeed, that we ought to make progress during our whole life, and that everything that we have is merely begun. Let us observe, however, what Paul designs to prove — that the gifts in question are but temporary. Now he proves this from the circumstance, that the advantage of them is only for a time — so long as we aim at the mark by making progress every day. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(798)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Seront un iour abolis</span>;” — “Will one day be done away.” </p></div></div>
