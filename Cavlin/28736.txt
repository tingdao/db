Hence our brethren who are now dead, did to no purpose live in the faith of Christ.” But if it is granted that the essence of the soul is immortal, this argument appears, at first sight, conclusive; for it will very readily be replied, that the dead have not <em>perished, </em>inasmuch as their souls live in a state of separation from their bodies. Hence some fanatics conclude that there is no life in the period intermediate between death and the resurrection; but this frenzy is easily refuted. <span class="cite-ref">(42)</span> For although the souls of the dead are now living, and enjoy quiet repose, yet the whole of their felicity and consolation depends exclusively on the resurrection; because it is well with them on this account, and no other, that they wait for that day, on which they shall be called to the possession of the kingdom of God. Hence as to the hope of the dead, all is over, unless that day shall sooner or later arrive. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(41)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La profession de Chrestiente</span>;” — “The profession of Christianity.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(42)</span> It is mentioned by Beza in his life of Calvin, that before leaving France in 1534, he “published his admirable treatise, entitled Psychopannychia, against the error of those who, reviving a doctrine which had been held in the earliest ages, taught that the soul, when separated from the body, falls <em>asleep.” </em>— Calvin’s<em>Tracts, </em>volume 1 page 26. — Ed. </p></div></div>
