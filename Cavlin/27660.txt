<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Yea, ye know </em>He doth not, in these words, precisely set down a law which all the ministers of the word must needs keep; for he did not behave himself so loftily and lordlike, that he did take that away which the Lord had granted to his servants, but doth rather in many places maintain their right, which is, that they be maintained with that which is common, <span class="bvs">Mat_10:10</span>; <span class="bvs">1Co_9:14</span>; <span class="bvs">Gal_6:6</span>; <span class="bvs">1Ti_5:17</span>; <span class="bvs">Phi_4:10</span>; <span class="bvs">2Co_11:8</span>. Whereunto belongeth that, that he suffered many churches to minister unto him food and raiment. Neither did he only freely receive wages for the work which he did in any place of those who were there, but when he was in necessity at Corinth, he saith that he robbed other churches to relieve his poverty. Therefore, he doth not simply command pastors to maintain their life with their handy-work, but immediately after he declareth how far forth he exhorteth them to follow his example. Those men of Corinth did not deny him that which was due to him;<span class="cite-ref">(448)</span> but seeing that the false apostles did boast that they did their work freely, and get thereby praise among the people; Paul would not be behind them in this point, nor give them any occasion to accuse him falsely; as he himself affirmeth ( <span class="bvs">1Co_9:15</span>, and <span class="bvs">2Co_11:10</span>). Therefore, he warneth that there be no stumbling-block laid in the way of the weak, and that their faith be not overthrown. For to receive the weak, importeth as much as somewhat to bear with their rudeness and simplicity, as it is ( <span class="bvs">Rom_14:1</span>).</p><p><em>And to remember. </em>We read this sentence in no place word for word; but the Evangelists have other not much unlike this, out of which Paul might gather this. Again, we know that all the sayings of Christ were not written; and he repeateth that general doctrine of the contempt of money; whereof this is a true token, when a man is more bent to give than to take. Neither did Christ speak only politicly,<span class="cite-ref">(449)</span> as if those who are liberal are therefore blessed, because they bind other men unto them with their benefits, and it is a kind of bondage to owe anything; but he had respect unto an higher thing, because, he which giveth to the poor lendeth unto the Lord, ( <span class="bvs">Pro_19:17</span>) that those be faithful and good stewards of God, who impart to their brethren some of that plenty which they have lent them; that men draw nearer unto God in nothing than in liberality. We do also read these titles of liberality in profane authors; and a good part of the world confess that these things are true, but they consent (as it is in the proverb) with ass’s ears. For the common life doth show how few be persuaded that nothing ought more to be wished, than that we bestow our goods to help our brethren. For which cause the disciples of Christ must more studiously think upon this felicity, that abstaining so much as in them lieth, from that which is another man’s, they accustom themselves to give. And yet they must not do this with an haughty heart, as if it were a miserable thing for them to be in any man’s danger;<span class="cite-ref">(450)</span> either through ambition, that they may bind other men to them; but only that they may exercise themselves willingly in the duties of love, and by this means make known the grace of their adoption.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(448)</span></p><p>“ Non negabant illi Corinthii debitam mercedem,” those Corinthians did not deny that hire was due to him. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(449)</span></p><p>“ Politice,” of what was politic. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(450)</span></p><p>“ Ipsos cuiquam esse obnoxios,” that they themselves should be subjected (under obligation) to any one. </p></div></div>
