<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>Have mercy on me, O Lord. </em>I stated, a little ago, that there was at first but <em>one </em>who <em>cried out</em>, but the other was induced by a similar necessity to join him. They confer on Christ no ordinary honor, when they request him to <em>have mercy</em>, and relieve them; for they must have been convinced that he had in his power the assistance or remedy which they needed. But their faith is still more clearly exhibited by their acknowledgment of him as Messiah, to whom we know that the Jews gave this designation, Son <em>of David </em>They therefore apply to Christ, not only as some Prophet, but as that person whom God had promised to be the only Author of salvation. The <em>cry </em>proved the ardor of the desire; for, though they knew that what they said exposed them to the hatred of many, who were highly displeased with the honor done to Christ, their fear was overcome by the ardor of desire, so that they did not refrain, on this account, from raising their voice aloud. </p></div>
