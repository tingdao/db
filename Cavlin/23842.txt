<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>When the chief priests and scribes saw. </em>Luke relates that the Pharisees began to grumble, while he was still on the road. <span class="cite-ref">(17)</span> It was the disciples that were then crying out: the others wished to have them silenced. Christ replied, that it was in vain for them to make opposition; because God would rather make <em>the stones cry out </em>than permit the reign of His Son to be forgotten. It is probable that, as the <em>crying out </em>was not diminished, and as even <em>the children </em>now joined in it, <em>the scribes and priests </em>were roused to still fiercer indignation, and then commenced a new attack on Christ. They appear indirectly to reproach him by alleging that he is desirous to obtain the praises of <em>children. </em></p><p>But we must observe whence their displeasure arose. That it was connected with ungodly malice and outrageous contempt of God is evident from the fact, that his miracles gave them not less uneasiness than the shouts of applause. But I now inquire about some more special reason. What was it that chiefly vexed them? Now we know how eagerly they contended for their authority; for the object to which their zeal carried them was, that the tyranny, which they had once claimed, might continue to be enjoyed by them; and it was no slight diminution of their power, if the people were at liberty to bestow on Christ the title of King. Even in trifling matters they wished their decisions to be regarded as oracles, <span class="cite-ref">(18)</span> so that it might not be permitted to approve or reject any thing but according to their pleasure. They therefore reckon it to be foolish and unreasonable, that the people should confer the title of Messiah on one whom they do not treat with any respect. And certainly, if they had done their duty, it would have been proper for them to direct the whole people, and to go before them as their leaders. For the priests had been appointed, that <em>from their lips </em>all might seek the knowledge of <em>the Law, </em>and, in short, that they might be the <em>messengers </em>and interpreters <em>of the God of armies, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mal_2:7</span>.) But as they had basely extinguished the light of truth, Christ appropriately replies, that they gain nothing by endeavoring to suppress the doctrine of salvation, for it will rather break out from <em>the stones. </em></p><p>There is likewise an implied admission; for Christ does not deny that it is an unnatural order for the uneducated multitude and <em>children </em>to be the first to magnify with their voice the coming of the Messiah, but as the truth is wickedly suppressed by those who ought to have been its lawful witnesses, it is not wonderful if God raise up others, and — to their shame — make choice of <em>children. </em>Hence we derive no slight consolation; for though wicked men leave no stone unturned for concealing the reign of Christ, we learn from this passage that their efforts are in vain. They hope that, when some of the multitude, that is carrying forward the kingdom of Christ, shall have been put to death, and others shall be silenced by fear, they will gain their object. But God will disappoint them; for He will sooner give mouths and tongues to <em>stones </em>than allow the kingdom of His Son to be without witnesses. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(17)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Christ estant encore en chemin</span>;” — “Christ being still on the road.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(18)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour arrests ou revelations celestes</span>;” — “as decisions or revelations from heaven.” </p></div></div>
