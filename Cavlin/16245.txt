<div class="comment-content"><p>In verse fifth some read —<em>behind and before thou hast fashioned me; </em><span class="cite-ref">(203)</span> but <span class="lang he-il">צור</span>, <em>tsur, </em>often signifies <em>to shut up, </em>and David, there can be no doubt, means that he was surrounded on every side, and so kept in sight by God, that he could not escape in any quarter. One who finds the way blocked up turns back; but David found himself hedged in behind as well as before. The other clause of the verse has the same meaning; for those put a very forced interpretation upon it who think that it refers to God’s fashioning us, and applying his hand in the sense of an artizan to his work; nor does this suit with the context. And it is much better to understand it as asserting that God by his hand, laid as it were upon men, holds them strictly under his inspection, so that they cannot move a hair’s breadth without his knowledge. <span class="cite-ref">(204)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(203)</span> Thus the Septuagint have <span class="lang el-gr">ἔπλασάς με</span>, <em>Thou hast formed me</em>. Similar is the rendering of the Syriac. Those who embrace this view take the verb, as if the root were <span class="lang he-il">יצר</span>, <em>yatsar. </em>“But,” says Phillips, “it is certain that the root of <span class="lang he-il">צרתני</span> must be <span class="lang he-il">צור</span>, <em>to afflict, press, besiege. </em>Hence the meaning of the verse is, ‘Thou hast so pressed upon, or besieged me, both behind and before, that I find there is no escaping from thee; <em>Thou hast placed thy hand </em>upon me, so that I am quite in thy power.’ The whole passage is a figure, representing God’s thorough knowledge of man.” —<em>Phillips. </em>“<em>Thou besettest me behind and before, i.e. </em>thou knowest all my doings as perfectly as if I were begirt by thee on every <em>side. </em>” —<em>Cresswell. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(204)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme mettant la main sur eux pour los arrester par le collet, ainsi qu’on dit, tellement qu’ils ne peuvent bouger le moins du monde qu’il ne le scache</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
