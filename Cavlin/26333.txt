<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>If thou dost these things; </em>that is, if thou aspirest to such greatness that all may applaud thee, direct towards thee the eyes of all. And they add, <em>show thyself to the world, </em>using the word <em>world, </em>as contrasted with the small number of persons among whom he was spending his time without honor. We might also draw from it another meaning. “<em>If thou dost these things</em>, that is, since thou art endued with so great power as to procure reputation for thyself by miracles, do not throw them away; for all that has been given to thee by God thou spendest here to no purpose, because there are none to bear thee testimony, or to hold thee in just estimation.” Hence we perceive how great is the indolence of men in considering the works of God; for the relations of Christ would never have spoken in this manner, if they had not — as it were — trampled under foot the manifest proofs of his Divine power, which they ought to have beheld with the greatest admiration and reverence. What is here told us concerning Christ happens in daily experience, that the children of God suffer greater annoyance from their near relations than from strangers; for they are instruments of Satan which tempt, sometimes to ambition, and sometimes to avarice, those who desire to serve God purely and faithfully. But such Satans receive a vigorous repulse from Christ, who thus instructs us by his example, that we ought not to yield to the foolish wishes of <em>brethren </em>or relations. <span class="cite-ref">(179)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(179)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De nos parens</span>.” </p></div></div>
