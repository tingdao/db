<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And in this I give my advice. </em>The <em>advice </em>he places in contrast with the <em>commandment </em>of which he had spoken a little before. (<span class="bvs">2Co_8:8</span>.) “I merely point out what is expedient in the way of <em>advising </em>or <em>admonishing.” </em>Now this <em>advantage </em>is not perceived by the judgment of the flesh; for where is the man to be found, who is persuaded that it is of <em>advantage </em>to deprive himself of something with the view of helping others? It is, indeed, the saying of a heathen — “What you have given away is the only riches that you will always have; <span class="cite-ref">(671)</span> but the reason is, that whatever is given to friends is placed beyond all risk.” The Lord, on the other hand, would not have us influenced by the hope of a reward, or of any remuneration in return, but, on the contrary, though men should be ungrateful, so that we may seem to have lost what we have given away, he would have us, not- withstanding, persevere in doing good. The advantage, however, arises from this — that </p><p>“He that giveth to the poor (as Solomon says in <span class="bvs">Pro_19:17</span>) lendeth to the Lord,” </p><p>whose blessing, of itself, is to be regarded as a hundredfold more precious than all the treasures of the world. The word <em>useful, </em>however, is taken here to mean <em>honorable, </em>or at least Paul measures what is <em>useful </em>by what is <em>honorable, </em>because it would have been disgraceful to the Corinthians to draw back, or to stop short in the middle of the course, when they had already advanced so far. At the same time it would also have been <em>useless, </em>inasmuch as everything that they had attempted to do would have come short of acceptance in the sight of God. </p><p><em>Who had begun not only to do. </em>As <em>doing </em>is more than <em>willing, </em>the expression may seem an improper one; but <em>willing </em>here is not taken simply, (as we commonly say,) but conveys the idea of spontaneous alacrity, that waits for no monitor. For there are <em>three </em>gradations, so to speak, as to acting. <em>First</em>, we sometimes act unwillingly, but it is from shame or fear. <em>Secondly, </em>we act willingly, but at the same time it is from being either impelled, or induced from influence, apart from our own minds. <em>Thirdly, </em>we act from the prompting of our own minds, when we of our own accord set ourselves to do what is becoming. Such <em>cheerfulness </em>of anticipation is better than the actual <em>performance </em>of the deed. <span class="cite-ref">(672)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(671)</span> Calvin, it is to be observed, quotes the same sentiment, when commenting on <span class="bvs">1Co_16:2</span>, (see p. 69,) but in the present instance he takes occasion, most appropriately to his particular purpose, to notice the connection in which the poet introduces it, which is as follows: — </p><p>“<em>Callidus effracta nummos fur auferet arca;</em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Prosternet patrios impia flamma Lares.</em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Extra fortunam est, quicquid donatur amicis;</em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Quas dederis, solas semper habebis opes </em> ” </p><p>“The dexterous thief will break open your chest, and carry off your money; a fire, raised by a base incendiary, will lay in the dust your paternal mansion; but whatever has been given to friends is placed beyond all risk. What you have given away is the only wealth that you will always retain.” — MARTIAL, <span class="bvs">Eph_5:39</span>. </p><p>It is mentioned by <em>Dr. Bennett, </em>in his Lectures on Christ’s Preaching, (p. 104,) that on the tomb of Robert of Doncaster, there was the following inscription — “What I gave, I have; what I kept I lost.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(672)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vne telle promptitude de s’auancer a faire sans estre incite ou aduerti d’ailleurs, est plus que le faict mesme</span>;” — “Such promptitude in being forward to act, without requiring to be stirred up or admonished by any one, is more than the deed itself” </p></div></div>
