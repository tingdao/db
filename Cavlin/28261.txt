<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Not thinking arrogantly of yourselves, </em><span class="cite-ref">(395)</span><em>etc. </em>The Apostle employs words in Greek more significant, and more suitable to the antithesis, “Not thinking,” he says, “of high things:” by which he means, that it is not the part of a Christian ambitiously to aspire to those things by which he may excel others, nor to assume a lofty appearance, but on the contrary to exercise humility and meekness: for by these we excel before the Lord, and not by pride and contempt of the brethren. A precept is fitly added to the preceding; for nothing tends more to break that unity which has been mentioned, than when we elevate ourselves, and aspire to something higher, so that we may rise to a higher situation. I take the term <em>humble </em>in the neuter gender, to complete the antithesis. </p><p>Here then is condemned all ambition and that elation of mind which insinuates itself under the name of magnanimity; for the chief virtue of the faithful is moderation, or rather lowliness of mind, which ever prefers to give honor to others, rather than to take it away from them. </p><p>Closely allied to this is what is subjoined: for nothing swells the minds of men so much as a high notion of their own wisdom. His desire then was, that we should lay this aside, hear others, and regard their counsels. [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>] has rendered <span class="lang el-gr">φρονίμους</span><em>, </em><em>arrogantes </em> — arrogant; but the rendering is strained and frigid; for Paul would in this case repeat the same word without any meaning. However, the most appropriate remedy for curing arrogance is, that man should not be over-wise in his own esteem. </p><p><strong>(395)</strong> The first clause is omitted. The text of [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] is, “Mutuo alii in alios sensu affecti<span class="lang el-gr">;” τὸ αὐτὸ εἰς αλλήλους φρονοῦντες; </span> “Itidem alii in alios affecti — Feel alike towards on another,” [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>]; “Be entirely united in your regards for each other,” [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>]; “Be of the same disposition towards one another,” [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>]. The verb means to think, or to feel, or to mind, in the sense of attending to, or aspiring after a thing. It is used also in the next clause, evidently in the last sense, <em>minding</em>. There is no reason why its meaning should be different here; it would then be, “Mind the same things towards one another,” that is, Do to others what you expect others to do to you. It is to reduce to an axiom what is contained in the former verse. We may indeed give this version, “Feel the same, or alike towards one another,” that is, sympathize with one another: and this would still be coincident in meaning with the former verse; and it would be in accordance with the Apostle’s mode of writing. </p><p>But another construction has been given, “Think the same of one another,” that is, Regard one another alike in dignity and privilege as Christians, without elevating yourselves, and viewing yourselves better than others. This would well agree with the sentence which follows. </p><p>The two following clauses are thus given by [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>], “Affect not high things, but condescend to men of low rank,” — and by [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>], “Do not care for high things; but associate with lowly men.” The word<span class="lang el-gr">ταπεινοῖς, </span> is not found in the New Testament to be applied to things, but to persons. “Associate” is perhaps the best rendering of<span class="lang el-gr">συναπαγόμενοι, </span> which literally means to withdraw from one party in order to walk with another: they were to withdraw from those who minded high things, and walk or associate with the humble and lowly. “And cleave to the humble,” is the Syriac version. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
