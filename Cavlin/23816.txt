<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>You shall indeed drink my cup. </em>As they were disciples, it was proper that they should be assimilated to their Master. Christ warns them of what will take place, that they may be prepared to endure it with patience; and, in the persons of two men, he addresses all his followers. For though many believers die a natural death, and without violence or shedding of blood, yet it is common to all of them, as Paul informs us, (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:29</span>; <span class="bvs">2Co_3:18</span>,) <em>to be conformed to the image of Christ; </em>and, therefore, </p><p>during their whole life, they are sheep appointed to the slaughter, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_8:36</span>.) </p><p><em>Is not mine to give </em><span class="cite-ref">(658)</span> By this reply Christ surrenders nothing, but only states that the Father had not assigned to him this office of appointing to each person his own peculiar place in the kingdom of heaven. He came, indeed, in order to bring all his people to eternal life; but we ought to reckon it enough that the inheritance obtained by his blood awaits us. As to the degree in which some men rise above others, it is not our business to inquire, and God did not intend that it should be revealed to us by Christ, but that it should be reserved till the latest revelation. We have now ascertained Christ’s meaning; for he does not here reason as to his power, but only desires us to consider for what purpose he was sent by the Father, and what corresponds to his calling, and therefore distinguishes between the secret purpose of God and the nature of that teaching which had been enjoined on him. It is a useful warning, that we may learn to be wise with sobriety, and may not attempt to force our way into the hidden mysteries of God, and more especially, that we may not indulge excessive curiosity in our inquiries about the future state; for </p><p>It hath not yet appeared what we shall be, <LineBreak />till God shall make us like himself, (<span class="bvs">1Jo_3:2</span>. </p><p>It is also worthy of our notice, that these words do not imply that there will be equality among the children of God, after they have been admitted to the heavenly glory, but rather that to each is promised that degree of honor to which he has been set apart by the eternal purpose of God. </p><p><strong>(658)</strong><em>“ </em><em class="lang fr-fr">Ce n’est pas a moy a le dormer </em><em>;” </em>— <em>“it does not belong to me to give it.” </em></p></div>
