<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_3:5</span><strong>.</strong><em>And when he had looked around upon them with indignation </em>To convince us that this was a just and holy anger, Mark explains the reason of it to be, that he was <em>grieved on account of the blindness of their hearts. </em>First, then, Christ <em>is grieved, </em>because men who have been instructed in the Law of God are so grossly <em>blind; </em>but as it was malice that <em>blinded </em>them, his <em>grief </em>is accompanied by <em>indignation. </em>This is the true moderation of zeal, to be distressed about the destruction of wicked men, and, at the same time, to be filled with wrath at their ungodliness. Again, as this passage assures us, that Christ was not free from human passions, we infer from it, that the passions themselves are not sinful, provided there be no excess. In consequence of the corruption of our nature, we do not preserve moderation; and our anger, even when it rests on proper grounds, is never free from sin. With Christ the case was different; for not only did his nature retain its original purity, but he was a perfect pattern of righteousness. We ought therefore to implore from heaven the Spirit of God to correct our excesses. </p></div>
