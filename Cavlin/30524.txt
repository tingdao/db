That God may then continually shine upon us, we must devote ourselves to that study: let our faith at the same time acquiesce in witnesses so certain and credible. For when we have the prophets and apostles agreeing with us, nay, as the ministers of our faith, and God as the author, and angels as approvers, there is no reason that the ungodly, all united, should move us from our position.

There is in the noun <span class="lang el-gr">ἐντολὴ</span>, a metonymy, the commandment for what was commanded to be taught, the doctrine.
