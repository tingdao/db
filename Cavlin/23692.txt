<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>And I will give thee the keys </em>Here Christ begins now to speak of the public office, that is, of the Apostleship, which he dignifies with a twofold title. First, he says that the ministers of the Gospel are porters, so to speak, of the kingdom of heaven, because they carry its <em>keys; </em>and, secondly, he adds, that they are invested with a power of <em>binding and loosing, </em>which is ratified in heaven. <span class="cite-ref">(440)</span> The comparison of <em>the keys </em>is very properly applied to the office of teaching; as when Christ says (<span class="bvs">Luk_11:52</span>) that the scribes and Pharisees, in like manner, have <em>the key </em>of the kingdom of heaven, because they are expounders of the law. We know that there is no other way in which the gate of life is opened to us than by the word of God; and hence it follows that the key is placed, as it were, in the hands of the ministers of the word. </p><p>Those who think that the word <em>keys </em>is here used in the plural number, because the Apostles received a commission not only to <em>open </em>but also to <em>shut</em>, have some probability on their side; but if any person choose to take a more simple view of the meaning, let him enjoy his own opinion. <span class="cite-ref">(441)</span> Here a question arises, Why does the Lord promise that he will give to Peter what he appeared to have formerly given him by making him an Apostle? But this question has been already answered, <span class="cite-ref">(442)</span> when I said that <em>the twelve </em>were at first (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:5</span>) nothing more than temporary preachers, <span class="cite-ref">(443)</span> and so, when they returned to Christ, they had executed their commission; but after that Christ had risen from the dead, they then began to be appointed to be ordinary teachers of the Church. It is in this sense that the honor is now bestowed for the future. </p><p><em>Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth. </em>The second metaphor, or comparison, is intended directly to point out the forgiveness of sins; for Christ, in delivering us, by his Gospel, from the condemnation of eternal death, <em>looses </em>the cords of the curse by which we are held bound. The doctrine of the Gospel is, therefore, declared to be appointed for loosing our bonds, that, being loosed on earth by the voice and testimony of men, we may be actually <em>loosed </em>in heaven. But as there are many who not only are guilty of wickedly rejecting the deliverance that is offered to them, but by their obstinacy bring down on themselves a heavier judgment, the power and authority to <em>bind </em>is likewise granted to the ministers of the Gospel. It must be observed, however, that this does not belong to the nature of the Gospel, but is accidental; as Paul also informs us, when, speaking of the <em>vengeance </em>which he tells us that he has it in his power to execute against all unbelievers and rebels, he immediately adds, </p><p>When your obedience shall have been fulfilled, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Co_10:6</span>.) </p><p>For were it not that the reprobate, through their own fault, turn life into death, the Gospel would be to all <em>the power of God to salvation</em>, (<span class="bvs">Rom_1:16</span>;) but as many persons no sooner hear it than their impiety openly breaks out, and provokes against them more and more the wrath of God, to such persons its <em>savor </em>must be <em>deadly</em>, (<span class="bvs">2Co_2:16</span>.) </p><p>The substance of this statement is, that Christ intended to assure his followers of the salvation promised to them in the Gospel, that they might expect it as firmly as if he were himself to descend from heaven to bear testimony concerning it; and, on the other hand, to strike despisers with terror, that they might not expect their mockery of the ministers of the word to remain unpunished. Both are exceedingly necessary; for the inestimable <em>treasure </em>of life is exhibited to us <em>in earthen vessels</em>, (<span class="bvs">2Co_4:7</span>,) and had not the authority of the doctrine been established in this manner, the faith of it would have been, almost every moment, ready to give way. <span class="cite-ref">(444)</span> The reason why the ungodly become so daring and presumptuous is, that they imagine they have to deal with men. Christ therefore declares that, by the preaching of the Gospel, is revealed on the earth what will be the heavenly judgment of God, and that the certainty of life or death is not to be obtained from any other source. </p><p>This is a great honor, that we are God’s messengers to assure the world of its salvation. It is the highest honor conferred on the Gospel, that it is declared to be the <em>embassy </em>of mutual <em>reconciliation </em>between God and men, (<span class="bvs">2Co_5:20</span>.) In a word, it is a wonderful consolation to devout minds to know that the message of salvation brought to them by a poor mortal man is ratified before God. Meanwhile, let the ungodly ridicule, as they may think fit, the doctrine which is preached to them by the command of God, they will one day learn with what truth and seriousness God threatened them by the mouth of men. Finally, let pious teachers, resting on this assurance, encourage themselves and others to defend with boldness the life-giving grace of God, and yet let them not the less boldly thunder against the hardened despisers of their doctrine. </p><p>Hitherto I have given a plain exposition of the native meaning of the words, so that nothing farther could have been desired, had it not been that the Roman Antichrist, wishing to cloak his tyranny, has wickedly and dishonestly dared to pervert the whole of this passage. The light of the true interpretation which I have stated would be of itself sufficient, one would think, for dispelling his darkness; but that pious readers may feel no uneasiness, I shall briefly refute his disgusting calumnies. First, he alleges that Peter is declared to be the foundation of the Church. But who does not see that what he applies to the person of a man is said in reference to Peter’s faith in Christ? There is no difference of meaning, I acknowledge, between the two Greek words <span class="lang el-gr">Πέτρος</span> ( <em>Peter</em>) and <span class="lang el-gr">πέτρα</span>, ( <em>petra</em>, <em>a stone </em>or <em>rock</em>,) <span class="cite-ref">(445)</span> except that the former belongs to the Attic, and the latter to the ordinary dialect. But we are not to suppose that Matthew had not a good reason for employing this diversity of expression. On the contrary, the gender of the noun was intentionally changed, to show that he was now speaking of something different. <span class="cite-ref">(446)</span> A distinction of the same sort, I have no doubt, was pointed out by Christ in his own language; <span class="cite-ref">(447)</span> and therefore Augustine judiciously reminds the reader that it is not <span class="lang el-gr">πέτρα</span><em>(petra</em>, <em>a stone </em>or <em>rock) </em>that is derived from <span class="lang el-gr">Πέτρος</span>, ( <em>Peter</em>,) but <span class="lang el-gr">Πέτρος</span> ( <em>Peter</em>) that is derived from <span class="lang el-gr">πέτρα</span>, <em>(petra</em>, <em>a stone </em>or <em>rock ) </em></p><p>But not to be tedious, as we must acknowledge the truth and certainty of the declaration of Paul, that the Church can have no other <em>foundation </em>than Christ alone, (<span class="bvs">1Co_3:11</span>; <span class="bvs">Eph_2:20</span>,) it can be nothing less than blasphemy and sacrilege when the Pope has contrived another <em>foundation</em>. And certainly no words can express the detestation with which we ought to regard the tyranny of the Papal system on this single account, that, in order to maintain it, the foundation of the Church has been subverted, that the mouth of hell might be opened and swallow up wretched souls. Besides, as I have already hinted, that part does not refer to Peter’s public office, but only assigns to him a distinguished place among the sacred stones of the temple. The commendations that follow relate to the Apostolic office; and hence we conclude that nothing is here said to Peter which does not apply equally to the others who were his companions, for if the rank of apostleship was common to them all, whatever was connected with it must also have been held in common. </p><p>But it will be said, Christ addresses Peter alone: he does so, because Peter alone, in the name of all, had confessed Christ to be <em>the Son of God</em>, and to him alone is addressed the discourse, which applies equally to the rest. And the reason adduced by Cyprian and others is not to be despised, that Christ spake to all in the person of one man, in order to recommend the unity of the Church. They reply, <span class="cite-ref">(448)</span> that he to whom this privilege was granted in a peculiar manner is preferred to all others. But that is equivalent to saying that he was more an apostle than his companions; for the power to <em>bind </em>and to <em>loose </em>can no more be separated from the office of teaching and the Apostleship than light or heat can be separated from the sun. And even granting that something more was bestowed on Peter than on the rest, that he might hold a distinguished place among the Apostles, it is a foolish inference of the Papists, that he received the primacy, and became the universal head of the whole Church. Rank is a different thing from power, and to be elevated to the highest place of honor among a few persons is a different thing from embracing the whole world under his dominion. And in fact, Christ laid no heavier burden on him than he was able to bear. He is ordered to be the porter of the kingdom of heaven; he is ordered to dispense the grace of God by <em>binding </em>and <em>loosing; </em>that is, as far as the power of a mortal man reaches. All that was given to him, therefore, must be limited to the measure of grace which he received for the edification of the Church; and so that vast dominion, which the Papists claim for him, falls to the ground. </p><p>But though there were no strife or controversy about Peter, <span class="cite-ref">(449)</span> still this passage would not lend countenance to the tyranny of the Pope. For no man in his senses will admit the principle which the Papists take for granted, that what is here granted to Peter was intended to be transmitted by him to posterity by hereditary right; for he does not receive permission to give any thing to his successors. So then the Papists make him bountiful with what is not his own. Finally, though the uninterrupted succession were fully established, still the Pope will gain nothing by it till he has proved himself to be Peter’s lawful successor. And how does he prove it? Because Peter died at Rome; as if Rome, by the detestable murder of the Apostle, had procured for herself the primacy. But they allege that he was also bishop there. How frivolous <span class="cite-ref">(450)</span> that allegation is, I have made abundantly evident in my <em>Institutes</em>, (Book 4, Chapter 6,) to which I would willingly send my reader for a complete discussion of this argument, rather than annoy or weary him by repeating it in this place. Yet I would add a few words. Though the Bishop of Rome had been the lawful successor of Peter, since by his own treachery he has deprived himself of so high an honor, all that Christ bestowed on the successors of Peter avails him nothing. That the Pope’s court resides at Rome is sufficiently known, but no mark of a Church there can be pointed out. As to the pastoral office, his eagerness to shun it is equal to the ardor with which he contends for his own dominion. Certainly, if it were true that Christ has left nothing undone to exalt the heirs of Peter, still he was not so lavish as to part with his own honor to bestow it on apostates. </p><p><strong>(440)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Laquelle est receue et advouee es cieux</span>;” — “which is received and acknowledged in heaven.” </p><p><strong>(441)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ie n’y contredi point</span>;” — “I do not contradict him in it.” </p><p><strong>(442)</strong> Harmony, vol. 1, p. 437. </p><p><strong>(443)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ambassadeurs ou prescheurs temporels</span>;” — “temporary messengers or preachers.” </p><p><strong>(444)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’heure en heure elle seroit revoquee en doute</span>;” — “from hour to hour it would be called in question.” </p><p><strong>(445)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ie confesse bien qu’en la langue Grecque il n’y a pas grande difference entre le mot qui signifie une pierre, et celuy qui signifie un homme nomme Pierre</span>;” — “I readily acknowledge that, in the Greek language, there is no great difference between the word that signifies <em>a stone</em>, and that which signifies a man named <em>Peter</em>. <em>” </em></p><p><strong>(446)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A fin de monstrer qu’au second lieu il parloit de quelque autre chose que de la personne de Pierre</span>;” — “in order to show that, in the latter clause, he was speaking of something totally different from the person of Peter.” </p><p><strong>(447)</strong> By <em>Christ’s own language </em>is meant the <em>Syriac </em>— <em>a </em>dialect of <em>Hebrew </em>— which is supposed to have been the vernacular language of Palestine in the time of our Lord, and consequently to have been spoken by him and his apostles.
