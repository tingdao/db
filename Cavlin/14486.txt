<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong>and<strong>36</strong><em>I have seen the wicked terrible, etc. </em>David here confirms from his own experience what I have just said, namely, that although the wicked are intoxicated with their prosperity, and held in admiration by all on account of it, yet their happiness is transitory and evanescent, and, therefore, nothing else than a mere illusion. In the 35<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse he tells us, that it is no strange or unwonted thing for the ungodly, puffed up with their prosperity, to spread themselves far and wide, and to give occasion of terror to the innocent. Then he adds, that their greatness, which had been regarded with so much wonder, disappears in a moment. As to the meaning of the words, <span class="lang he-il">עריף</span>, <em>arits, </em>which we have rendered <em>terrible, </em>might also be translated <em>strong, </em>because the word from which it is derived signifies sometimes <em>to terrify, </em>and sometimes <em>to strengthen. </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">מתערה</span>,<em>mithareh, </em>is taken by some for <em>green, </em>but it rather means <em>discovering </em>or <em>spreading himself out, </em>as high and broad trees spread out their branches. David, I have no doubt, here rebukes the insolence of those who vaunt themselves immoderately. <em>To pass away, </em>in the 36<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, is used for <em>to vanish away; </em>and thus he admonishes us to sit still for a time, in order that it may appear, after it has passed away, that all that the world admires in the prosperity of the wicked has been only a mist. </p></div>
