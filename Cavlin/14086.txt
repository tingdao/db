<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>There did they tremble with fear, </em>The prophet now encourages himself and all the faithful with the best of all consolations, namely, that God will not forsake his people even to the end, but will at length show himself to be their defender. Some explain the adverb of place <em>there, </em>as meaning that God will take vengeance on the wicked in the presence of his saints, because they exercised their tyranny upon them. But I rather think that by this word there is expressed the certainty of their punishment, <span class="cite-ref">(289)</span> as if the Psalmist pointed to it with the finger. <span class="cite-ref">(290)</span> It may also intimate what we may gather from <span class="bvs">Psa_53:0</span>, that the judgment of God would come upon them suddenly, and when they were not thinking about it; for it is there added, <em>where no fear is, </em>or, <em>where no fear was. </em><span class="cite-ref">(291)</span> Expositors, I am aware, differ in their interpretation of these words. Some supply the word <em>equal </em>or <em>like, </em>and read, There is no fear equal to it. Others refer them to those secret alarms with which the ungodly are tormented, even when there may be no ground for apprehension. God threatens the transgressors of his law with such mental torment that they “shall flee when none pursueth them,” (<span class="bvs">Lev_26:17</span>, and <span class="bvs">Pro_28:1</span>) and that “the sound of a shaking leaf shall chase them,” (<span class="bvs">Lev_26:36</span>) just as we see that they are themselves their own tormentors, and are agitated with mental trouble even when there is no external cause to create it. But I think the meaning of the prophet is different, namely, that when their affairs are in a state of the greatest tranquillity and prosperity, God will suddenly launch against them the bolts of his vengeance. </p><p>“For when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them,” (<span class="bvs">1Th_5:3</span>.) </p><p>The prophet, therefore, encourages and supports the faithful with this prospect, that the ungodly, when they think themselves free from all danger, and are securely celebrating their own triumphs, shall be overwhelmed with sudden destruction. </p><p>The reason of this is added in the last clause of the verse, namely, because God is determined to defend the righteous, and to take in hand their cause: <em>For God is in the generation of the righteous </em>Now, in order to preserve them safe, he must necessarily thunder in his wrath from heaven against their enemies, who unjustly oppress and waste them by violence and extortion. <span class="cite-ref">(292)</span> There is, however, some ambiguity in the word <span class="lang he-il">דור</span><em>, dor, </em>which we have translated <em>generation. </em>As this noun in Hebrew sometimes signifies <em>an age, </em>or, <em>the course of human life, </em>the sentence might be explained as follows: Although God for a time may seem to take no notice of the wrongs inflicted upon his servants by the wicked, yet he is ever present with them, and exercises his grace towards them during their whole life. But it seems to me a more simple and natural exposition to interpret the clause thus: That God is on the side of the righteous, and takes their part, as we say, <span class="cite-ref">(293)</span> so that <span class="lang he-il">דור</span><em>, dor, </em>will have the same signification here which the word <em>natio, </em>[nation,] sometimes has among the Latins. </p><p>In <span class="bvs">Psa_53:5</span>, the Psalmist adds a sentence which does not occur in this psalm, <em>For God hath scattered the bones of him that besiegeth thee, thou shalt put them to shame; because God hath rejected them. </em>By these words the prophet explains more clearly how God protects the righteous, that it is by delivering them from the jaws of death, just as if one were to put to flight those who had laid siege to a town, and were to set at liberty its inhabitants, who before were in great extremity and quite shut up. <span class="cite-ref">(294)</span> Whence it follows, that we must patiently bear oppression, if we desire to be protected and preserved by the hand of God, at the time of our greatest danger. The expression, <em>bones, </em>is used metaphorically for <em>strength </em>or <em>power. </em>The prophet particularly speaks of their power; for if the wicked were not possessed of riches, ammunition, and troops, which render them formidable, it would not appear, with sufficient evidence, that it is the hand of God which at length crushes them. The Psalmist next exhorts the faithful to a holy boasting, and bids them rest assured that an ignominious destruction hangs over the heads of the wicked. The reason of this is, because <em>God hath rejected them; </em>and if he is opposed to them, all things must ultimately go ill with them. As <span class="lang he-il">מאס</span>, <em>maäs, </em>which we have translated <em>to reject, </em>sometimes signifies <em>to despise, </em>some render it thus, <em>Because God hath despised them; </em>but this, I think, does not suit the passage. It would be more appropriate to read, —<em>He hath rendered them contemptible, </em>or, <em>subjected them to disgrace and ignominy. </em>Whence it follows, that they only draw down upon themselves dishonor and infamy while they strive to elevate themselves, as it were, in despite of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(289)</span> Though punishment had not as yet been actually inflicted on the oppressors of the people of God, of whom the Psalmist had spoken in the preceding verse, he speaks of their punishment as if it had taken place. The reason of this manner of speaking concerning things future in prophetic poetry, <em>Horsley </em>explains to be this, “That a scene typical of futurity is presented to the prophet’s imagination, and what he sees in that scene he speaks of as done.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(290)</span> The particle <span class="lang he-il">שם</span>, is used demonstratively, in reference to the scene which lies before the inspired poet’s fancy. “See there!” —<em>Horsley. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(291)</span> In the Septuagint version, to the words, <em>there were they in great fear, </em>there is added the words <span class="lang el-gr">οὑ ουκ ἠν ὁ φόβος</span>, <em>Where there was no fear, </em>the transcribers, perhaps, transferring it by memory from <span class="bvs">Psa_53:6</span>, or the translators adding the words by way of paraphrase. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(292)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui les foullent injustement et usent de violence et extorsion</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(293)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et tient leur parte, comme on dit</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(294)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne plus ne morns que si quelqu’un mettoit en fuite ceux qui auroyent dress, le siege derant une ville, et mettoit en liber, les habitans d’icelle qui estoyent auparavant en grande extremit, et bien enserrez</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
