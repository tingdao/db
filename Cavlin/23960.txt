This prediction of the destruction of the temple, therefore, opened up a path for the ignorant and weak. <span class="cite-ref">(126)</span> Now, though it was advantageous that <em>the temple </em>should be destroyed, lest its services and shadows might exercise an undue influence on the Jews, who were already too much attached to earthly elements, yet the chief reason was, that God determined, by this dreadful example, to take vengeance on that nation, for having rejected his Son, and despised the grace which was brought by him. And, therefore, this threatening must have intimidated the disciples from taking part with a rebellious people; as the punishments which Scripture denounces against the wicked ought now to deter us from those crimes which provoke the wrath of God. Every thing that it tells us, even about the fading and transitory aspect of the world, ought to correct the vanity of our senses, which too eagerly follow pomp, and luxury, and pleasure. But more especially, what it declares respecting the fearful destruction of Antichrist and his followers, ought to remove every obstacle which hinders us from pursuing the right course of faith. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(126)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin qu’ils ne trouvassent aucun destourbier de ce costé-la</span>;” — “that they might not find any impediment in that respect. </p></div></div>
