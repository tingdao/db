<div class="comment-content"><p>By these words the Prophet skews, that though the Moabites should adopt many means of escape, yet they should be taken, for God’s hand would everywhere entrap them. He mentions <em>terror </em>first, then the <em>pit</em>, and thirdly, the <em>snare</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(24)</span> that is, “Thou wilt be so frightened that terror will compel thee to flee; but when thou fleest, pits will be in the way into which thou wilt fall: but if thou wilt rise from the pit, snares will surround thee, and thou wilt be taken.” We then see that by these similitudes nothing else is meant but God’s judgment, which impended over the Moabites, so that it could by no means be averted by them; for no ways could be found out by which they could escape, because fear would force them to flee, and would, as it is usually the case, deprive them of mind and thought, and thus they would be driven here and there, and could not move from any place without meeting with a pit, and, as it has been said, after the pit there would be the snare. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(24)</span> There is a striking alliteration in these words, fear, pit, snare —<em>peched, pechet, pech. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
