<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Who alone hath done great wonders </em>Under this term he comprehends all God’s works from the least to the greatest, that he may awaken our admiration of them, for notwithstanding the signal marks of inconceivably great wisdom and divine power of God which are inscribed upon them we are apt through thoughtlessness to undervalue them. He declares that whatever is worthy of admiration is exclusively made and done by God, to teach us that we cannot transfer the smallest portion of the praise due to him without awful sacrilege, there being no vestige of divinity in the whole range of heaven and earth with which it is lawful to compare or equal him. He then proceeds to praise the wisdom of God, as particularly displayed in the skill with which <em>the heavens are framed, </em>giving evidence in a surprising degree of the fine discrimination with which they are adorned. <span class="cite-ref">(173)</span> Next he comes to speak of <em>the earth, </em>that he may lead us to form a proper estimate of this great and memorable work of God, stretching forth as it does a bare and dry superficies above the waters. As these elements are of a spherical form, the waters, if not kept within their limits, would naturally cover the earth, were it not that God has seen fit to secure a place of habitation for the human family. This philosophers themselves are forced to admit as one of their principles and maxims. <span class="cite-ref">(174)</span> The earth’s expanded surface, and the vacant space uncovered with water, has been justly considered therefore one of the great wonders of God. And it is ascribed to his mercy, because his only reason for displacing the waters from their proper seat was that regard which he had in his infinite goodness for the interests of man. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(173)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les cieux sont composez d’un si excellent et bel artifice, qu’ils crient que c’est d’une facon admirable qu’ils ont este ornez d’une si plaisante distinction</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(174)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De mettre ceci entre lents principes et maximes</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
