<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Thou art a priest forever, etc. </em>It is on the single word <em>forever, </em>that the Apostle lays stress in this passage; for he confirms what he said of an <em>indissoluble life</em>. He then shows that Christ differs from the whole race of Levi, because he is made a priest for ever. <span class="cite-ref">(122)</span></p><p>But here it may be objected, as the Jews also do, that the word,<span class="lang he-il">לעולם </span><em>laoulam, </em>does not always mean eternity, but the extent of one age, or, at farthest, a long time; and it is added, that when Moses speaks of the ancient sacrifices, he often uses this expression, “This ordinance shall be forever.” (<span class="bvs">Exo_12:17</span>.) To this I answer that whenever the sacrifices of the Law are mentioned, “forever” is to be confined to the time of the Law; nor ought this to be deemed strange; for by the coming of Christ a certain renovation of the world was effected. Whenever, then, Moses speaks of his own ministration, he extends the longest time no farther than to Christ. It must yet be also observed, that “forever” is applied to the ancient sacrifices, not with regard to the external ceremony, but on account of their mystical signification. On the present occasion, however, this reason ought to be sufficient, that Moses and his ministrations were for ever; that is, until the coming of the kingdom of Christ, under whom the world was renovated. Now when Christ is come, and a perpetual priesthood is given to him, we can find no end to his age, so that it cannot terminate after a certain period of time. So when applied to him, the word ought to be understood in the sense of eternity; for by the context we are always to judge of the meaning of the word, <span class="lang he-il">לעולם</span><em>laoulam </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(122)</span> This paragraph extends from the 11<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse to the end of the 17<span class="cite-ref">th</span>. The “law” parenthetically referred to in the 11<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, seems not to be the Mosaic Law generally, as too commonly supposed, but the law respecting the Levitical priesthood, as it appears evident from the 12<span class="cite-ref">th</span> and the following verses, for what is spoken of is Christ as being a priest not in succession from Aaron, but according to the order of Melchisedec.
