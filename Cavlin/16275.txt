<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>The man of tongue</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(232)</span><em>etc</em>. Some understand by this the <em>loquacious man</em>, but the sense is too restricted; nor is the reference to a reproachful, garrulous, vain and boastful man, but the man of virulence, who wars by deceit and calumny, and not openly. This is plain from what is said of the other class of persons in the subsequent part of the sentence, that his enemies were given to open violence as well as to treachery and cunning — like the lion as well as the wolf — as formerly he complained that the poison of the asp or viper was under their lips. The words run in the future tense, and many interpreters construe them into the optative form, or into a prayer; but I prefer retaining the future tense, as David does not appear so much to pray, as to look forward to a coming deliverance. Whether his enemies wrought by treachery, or by open violence, he looks forward to God as his deliverer. The figure drawn from hunting is expressive. The hunter, by spreading his toils on all sides, leaves no way of escape for the wild beast; and the ungodly cannot by any subterfuge elude the divine judgments. <em>Mischief hunts them into banishment’s</em>, for the more they look for impunity and escape, they only precipitate themselves more certainly upon destruction. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(232)</span> “<em>A man, of tongue</em>, <em>i.e</em>. , of evil tongue; a slanderer or detractor.” — <em>Phillips</em>. The Bible translation renders the phrase “an evil speaker;” and the Chaldee Paraphrase has “the man of detraction, with a three-forked tongue;” because such a man wounds <em>three </em>at once — the receiver, the sufferer, and himself. </p></div></div>
