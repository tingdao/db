<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Jesus, who is called Christ </em>By the surname <em>Christ, Anointed, </em>Matthew points out his office, to inform the readers that this was not a private person, but one divinely <em>anointed </em>to perform the office of Redeemer. What that anointing was, and to what it referred, I shall not now illustrate at great length. As to the word itself, it is only necessary to say that, after the royal authority was abolished, it began to be applied exclusively to Him, from whom they were taught to expect a full recovery of the lost salvation. So long as any splendor of royalty continued in the family of David, the kings were wont to be called <span class="lang el-gr">χριστοί,</span><em>anointed. </em><span class="cite-ref">(96)</span> But that the fearful desolation which followed might not throw the minds of the godly into despair, it pleased God to appropriate the name of <em>Messiah, Anointed, </em>to the Redeemer alone: as is evident from Daniel, (<span class="bvs">Dan_9:25</span>.) The evangelical history everywhere shows that this was an ordinary way of speaking, at the time when the Son of God was “manifested in the flesh,” (<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:16</span>.) </p><p><strong>(96)</strong> Every reader of the Bible is familiar with the phrase, <em>the Lord's anointed, </em>as applied to David and his successors, (<span class="bvs">2Sa_19:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Lam_4:20</span>.) — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
