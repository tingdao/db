<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Judah is a lion’s whelp</em>. This similitude confirms the preceding sentence, that Judah would be formidable to his enemies. Yet Jacob seems to allude to that diminution which took place, when the greater part of the people revolted to Jeroboam. For then the king of Judah began to be like a sleeping lion, for he did not shake his mane to diffuse his terror far and wide, but, as it were, laid him down in his den. Yet a certain secret power of God lay hidden under that torpor, and they who most desired his destruction, and who were most able to do him injury, did not dare to disturb him. Therefore, after Jacob has transferred the supreme authority over his brethren to Judah alone; he now adds, by way of correction, that, though his power should happen to be diminished, he would nevertheless remain terrible to his enemies, like a lion who lies down in his lair. <span class="cite-ref">(204)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(204)</span><em>Bishop Lowth’s </em>translationin this: </p><p>“Judah is a lion’s welp.<LineBreak />From the prey, my son, thou art gone up<LineBreak />He stoopeth down, he coucheth as a lion,<LineBreak />And as a lioness; who shall rouse him?” </p><p>It is to be observed that three different words are here used in the original to express the metaphor, which illustrates the character of the tribe of Judah.

These different terms are supposed to represent the tribe of Judah in its earliest period, in the age of David, and in subsequent times. </p></div></div>
