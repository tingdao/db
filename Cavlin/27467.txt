<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>With our beloved Barnabas and Paul </em>They set these praises against the slanders wherewith the false apostles had essayed to bring Paul and Barnabas out of credit.<span class="cite-ref">(145)</span> And, first, to the end they may remove the opinion of disagreement which had possessed the minds of many, they testify their consent; secondly, they commend Paul and Barnabas for their ferventness in zeal and most manlike courage, that they were not afraid to venture or lay down their souls for Christ’s sake. And this is an excellent virtue in a minister of the gospel, and which deserveth no small praise, if he shall not only be stout and courageous to execute the office of teaching, but also be ready to enter danger which is offered in defense of his doctrine. As the Lord doth thus try the faith and constancy of those which be his, so he doth, as it were, make them noble with the ensigns of virtue, that they may excel in his Church. Therefore, Paul holdeth forth the marks of Christ which he did bear in his body, ( <span class="bvs">Gal_6:17</span>) as a buckler to drive back those knaves which did trouble his doctrine. And though it do not so fall out with most stout and courageous teachers and preachers of the gospel, that they strive for the gospel until they come in danger of life, because the matter doth not so require, yet is this no let but that Christ may purchase authority for his martyrs, so often as he bringeth them into worthy and renowned conflicts.</p><p>Nevertheless, let even those who are not enforced to enter combat by any necessity be ready to shed their blood, if God see it good at any time that it should be so. But the apostles commend the fortitude of Paul and Barnabas only in a good cause; because, if it were sufficient to enter dangers manfully, the martyrs of Christ should nothing differ from troublesome and frenzied men, from cutters and roysters.<span class="cite-ref">(146)</span> Therefore, Paul and Barnabas are commended, not because they laid open themselves simply to dangers, but because they refuse not to die for Christ’s sake. Peradventure, also, the apostles meant to nip<span class="cite-ref">(147)</span> those knaves by the way, who, having never suffered any thing for Christ’s sake, came out of their roust and dainties<span class="cite-ref">(148)</span> to trouble the churches, which cost the courageous soldiers of Christ dearly.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(145)</span></p><p>“ Paulo et Barnabas aspergeri,” to asperse Paul and Barnabas. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(146)</span></p><p>“Nihil a tumultuosis et phreneticis, nihil a gladiatoribus differrent ,” should differ in no respect from tumultuous and frenzied men, or from gladiators. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(147)</span></p><p>“ Oblique perstringere,” indirectly to lash. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(148)</span></p><p>“ Ex sua umbra et deliciis prodierant,” had come forth from their luxurious retirement. </p></div></div>
