<div class="comment-content"><p>It follows, <em>Come shall the inhabitants of one to one</em>, that is, the inhabitants of one city to another; <em>saying, going let us go</em>, <em>etc</em>. He means by these words, that there will be a mutual consent among all nations, so that they will stimulate one another, and thus unite together their exertions. We here see that the Prophet’s object was to encourage the Jews to entertain good hope, and thus to cause them to persevere, so that they might not doubt but that success would attend their work and labor, because the Lord would have himself worshipped at Jerusalem, not only by themselves but also by all nations. But as the Jews could not believe that nations could by force be drawn there, he teaches them, that their assembling would be voluntary; he says that those who had been before extremely refractory would be disposed to come of their own accord, so that there would be no need of external force to constrain them; for they would willingly come, nay, would excite one another, and by mutual exhortations stimulate themselves so as to come together to worship God at Jerusalem. </p><p>The ardor and vehemence of their zeal is to be noticed; for the Prophet says, that they would come of their own accord, and also encourage one another, according to what we have seen in the second chapter <span class="bvs">Zec_2:1</span>, Lay hold will each on the hand of his brother, and say, let us go to the mount of the God of Jacob. But more is expressed in this place, for not only shall each one encourage his brother whenever met and an opportunity be offered, but he says that they will come from all quarters. We now then see the design of the Prophet in these words. And we hence learn, that faith then only produces its legitimate fruit when zeal is kindled, so that every one strives to increase the kingdom of God, and to gather the straying, that the Church may be filled. For when any one consults his own private benefit and has no care for others, he first betrays most clearly his own inhumanity, and where there is no love the Spirit of God does not rule there. Besides, true godliness brings with it a concern for the glory of God. It is no wonder then that the Prophet, when describing true and real conversion, says, that each would be solicitous about his brethren, so as to stimulate one another, and also that the hearts of all would be so kindled with zeal for God, that they would hasten together to celebrate his glory. </p><p>Then he adds, <em>Let us go to entreat the face of Jehovah</em>. The phrase is common in Scripture. But we must observe, that the Prophet in speaking of God’s worship, sets prayer in the first rank, for prayer to God is the chief part, yea, the main thing in religion. It is, indeed, immediately added, <em>and to seek Jehovah</em>: he explains the particular by the general; and in the next verse he inverts the order, beginning with the general. However, the meaning continues the same, for God seeks nothing else but that we should be teachable and obedient, so as to be prepared to follow wherever he may call us, and at the same time carefully to enquire respecting his will, as we have need of him as our leader and teacher, so that we may not foolishly go astray through winding and circuitous courses; for if we deem it enough to take presumptuously our own way, the endeavor to seek God will be superfluous. It must then be observed, that God is then only really sought when men desire to learn from his word how he is to be worshipped. But, as I have already said, the Prophet adds prayer here, for the design of the whole truth respecting salvation is to teach us, that our life depends on God, and that whatever belongs to eternal life must be hoped for and expected from him. <span class="cite-ref">(92)</span> We now then understand the import of the whole. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(92)</span> The 20<span class="cite-ref">th</span> and 21<span class="cite-ref">st</span> I render thus— </p><p>  </p><p><span class="cite-note">20.</span>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts Yet <em>it shall be </em>that come shall people And the inhabitants of many cities; Yea, the inhabitants of one shall go to another, saying, “Going let us go to implore the favor of Jehovah; And to seek Jehovah of hosts, go also will I.” </p><p>The verb rendered “implore,” means to solicit with importunity, or earnestness. “To conciliate the regard of Jehovah,” as rendered by <em>Henderson</em>, is too much in the style of modern phraseology; nor is the meaning conveyed. <em>Blayney’s </em>version is better, “To supplicate the favor of Jehovah.” It seems more suitable to connect the words “to seek Jehovah,” with the last sentence. We find the two clauses in the next verse, but in an inverted order— </p><p>  </p><p><span class="cite-note">22.</span>Yea, come shall many people and mighty nations To seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, And to implore the favor of Jehovah. </p><p>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
