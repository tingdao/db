In this comparison he takes in two points that he had touched upon — that he had sought neither glory nor gain among the Thessalonians. For a mother in nursing her infant shews nothing of power or dignity. Paul says that he was such, inasmuch as he voluntarily refrained from claiming the honor that was due to him, and with calmness and modesty stooped to every kind of office. <em>Secondly</em>, a mother in nursing her children manifests a certain rare and wonderful affection, inasmuch as she spares no labor and trouble, shuns no anxiety, is wearied out by no assiduity, and even with cheerfulness of spirit gives her own blood to be sucked. In the same way, Paul declares that he was so disposed towards the Thessalonians, that he was prepared to lay out his life for their benefit. This, assuredly, was not the conduct of a man that was sordid or avaricious, but of one that exercised a disinterested affection, and he expresses this in the close — <em>because ye were dear unto us </em>In the mean time, we must bear in mind, that all that would be ranked among true pastors must exercise this disposition of Paul—to have more regard to the welfare of the Church than to their own life, and not be impelled to duty by a regard to their own advantage, but by a sincere love to those to whom they know that they are conjoined, and laid under obligation. <span class="cite-ref">(527)</span></p><p><strong>(525)</strong> The rendering of Wicliff (1380) is, as usual, in accordance with the Vulgate— “we weren made litil.” —<em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(526)</strong> “Abaissement et humilite;” — “Abasement and humility.” </p><p><strong>(527)</strong> “Pour vne vraye amour et non feinte qu’ils portent a ceux, ausquels ils scauent que Dieu les a conionts et liez ou obligez;” — “From a true and unfeigned love which they bear to those, to whom they know that God has conjoined, and tied, or bound them.” </p></div>
