<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>The third time. </em>The number <em>three </em>refers to the distance of time. Christ had already appeared to his disciples more than <em>seven </em>times, but all that had been transacted in one day is included in one manifestation. The Evangelist, therefore, means that Christ had been seen by the disciples at intervals, in order to confirm their belief of his resurrection. </p></div>
