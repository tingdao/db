In the former case, Christ, by an allusion to <em>the temple, </em>affirmed that whatever was connected with his personal holiness was not a transgression of the Law; but now, he declares that he has received authority to exempt his followers from the necessity of observing the Sabbath. <em>The Son of man, </em>(he says,) in the exercise of his authority, can relax the Sabbath in the same manner as other legal ceremonies. And certainly out of Christ the bondage of the Law is wretched, from which he alone delivers those on whom he bestows the free <em>Spirit of adoption, </em><span class="cite-ref">(82)</span> (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:15</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(82)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ausquels il donne l’Esprit d’adoption, qui est l’Esprit de la liberte</span>;” — “to whom he gives the Spirit of adoption which is the Spirit of liberty.” </p></div></div>
