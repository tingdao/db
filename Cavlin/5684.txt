<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Yet the Lord hath not given. </em>By reproaching them with their past stupidity, he stirs up their desire for a better understanding, as if he had said, that they had been too long indifferent to so many miracles, and therefore they should no longer delay to rouse themselves, etc., to give greater heed to God; not because they had been so senseless that His acts had altogether escaped their notice, but because all acknowledgment of them had immediately come to an end. For, just as the drunken man, or one suffering from lethargy, when he hears a cry, raises his head for a moment, and opens his eyes, and then relapses into a state of torpor, so the people had never seriously applied their minds to consider God’s works; and when they had been aroused by some miracle, had immediately sunk back into forgetfulness, wherefore there is good cause why Moses should seek to awaken them from their dulness and stupidity by various methods. But he does not merely condemn their senselessness, and blindness, and deafness, but declares that they were thus senseless, and blind, and deaf, because they were not inspired with grace from above to profit duly by so many lessons. Thence we learn that a clear and powerful understanding is a special gift of the Spirit, since men are ever blind even in the brightest light, until they have been enlightened by God. What Moses relates of the Israelites, is unquestionably common to us all. He declares, then, that they were not induced by the conspicuous glory of God to fear and worship Him, because He had not given them either mind, or eyes, or ears. It is true that at man’s creation He had naturally bestowed upon him a mind, and ears, and eyes; but Moses means, that whatever innate light we have, is either hidden or lost, so that, as far as regards the highest point of wisdom, all our senses lie useless. True that in nature’s corruption, <em>the light </em>still <em>shineth in darkness, </em>but it is light which is soon obscured; therefore, the entire understanding and faculty of reason, in which men glory and pique themselves, is nought but smoke and darkness. Well then may David ask that his eyes may be opened to behold the secrets of the Law. <span class="cite-ref">(259)</span> (<span class="bvs">Psa_119:18</span>.) Still this defect by no means frees us from blame; because (as we are told) none have wisdom, but those to whom it is given by the Father of lights; for we are ignorant <span class="cite-ref">(260)</span> through our own fault. Besides, every one is sufficiently, and more than sufficiently convicted by his own conscience<em>, </em>that his ignorance is closely connected with pride and indolence, and is therefore voluntary. The word <em>heart </em>is not here used for the seat of the affections, but for the mind itself, which is the intellectual faculty of the soul. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(259)</span> The references here are to <span class="bvs">Psa_19:13</span>, and 18:24, (in the <em>Fr. </em>14.)
