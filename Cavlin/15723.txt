<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>They that go down to the sea in ships </em>Here we have another instance of God’s superintending care towards mankind pointed out to us by the prophet, exemplified in the bringing of those who are shipwrecked to the harbour, and this, too, as if he had raised them from the depth and darkness of the tomb, and brought them to live in the light of day. I do not understand what is here said about those who are accustomed to navigate the ocean <em>seeing the wonders of God, </em>as referring generally to the many wonderful things with which it abounds. Such persons are well fitted to bear testimony regarding the works of God, because they there behold more vast and various wonders than are to be seen upon earth. But it appears to me preferable to connect this with the subsequent context, where the prophet is his own interpreter, and where he shows how suddenly God raises and calms the tempest. </p><p>The sum of the matter is, that the scope of the passage is to point out that the lives of those who navigate the seas are often in great jeopardy by the storms which they encounter; because, as often as the ocean heaves and is agitated, and the billows rise and rage, so often does death stare them in the face. But he furnishes us with a still more vivid picture of the providence of God; for in telling us, that the sea does not of its own accord rise into a tempest, he makes use of the verb, <em>he speaks, </em>intimating that the word and providence of God make the winds blow, to agitate the sea. True, indeed, the mariners imagine from certain phenomena, that a storm is approaching, but sudden changes proceed only from the secret appointment of God. Therefore, he gives not merely a historical narrative of the manner in which squalls and storms arise, but, assuming the character of a teacher, begins with the cause itself, and then directs to the imminent danger with which the tempest is fraught; or rather, portrays, as in a picture, the image of death, in order that the goodness of God may appear the more conspicuous when the tempest happily ceases without any loss of life. They<em>mount up, </em>says he,<em>to the heavens, they descend into the deeps; </em>as if he should say, they mount up into the air, so that their life may be destroyed, and then they tumble down towards the caverns of the ocean, where they may be drowned. <span class="cite-ref">(284)</span> Next, he mentions the fears which torment them, or rather which may deprive them of understanding; intimating by these words, that however skilfully mariners may steer their vessels, they may happen to be deprived of their senses; and being thus paralysed, they could not avail themselves of aid, were it even at hand. For though they collect all their tackling, cast their sounding line into the deep, and unfurl their sails to all points, yet after making every attempt, and all human skill is baffled, they give themselves up to the mercy of wind and wave. All hope of safety being cut off, no farther means are employed by them. And now that all human aid fails, they cry unto God for deliverance, which is a convincing evidence that they had been as it were dead. <span class="cite-ref">(285)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(284)</span> “The men of the ship go up to heaven, <em>i.e</em>. , rise high in the air when the wave lifteth up the ship, and afterwards, because of the wave they descend to the deep; and from thus ascending and descending, the soul of the men of the ship melteth within them on account of the danger in which they are placed.” — <em>Kimchi. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(285)</span> The consternation into which those at sea are thrown in a dangerous storm, and their deliverance by God in answer to prayer, is so beautifully described in the well known and admirable hymn of Addison, that we shall take the liberty to quote a part of it: </p><p>“Think, O my soul! devoutly think,<LineBreak />How with affrighted eyes,<LineBreak />Thou saw’st the wide-extended deep,<LineBreak />In all its horrors rise. </p><p>“Confusion dwelt on every face,<LineBreak />And fear in every heart;<LineBreak />When waves on waves, and gulfs on gulfs,<LineBreak />O’ercame the pilot’s art. </p><p>“Yet then, from all my griefs, O Lord,<LineBreak />Thy mercy set me free;<LineBreak />Whilst in the confidence of prayer,<LineBreak />My soul took hold on Thee. </p><p>“For though in dreadful whirls we hung<LineBreak />High in the broken wave,<LineBreak />I knew Thou wert not slow to hear,<LineBreak />Nor impotent to save. </p><p>“The storm was laid, the winds retir’d,<LineBreak />Obedient to thy will;<LineBreak />The sea that roar’d at thy command,<LineBreak />At thy command was still!” </p></div></div>
