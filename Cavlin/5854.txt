<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Moses my servant, </em>etc A twofold meaning may be extracted — the one, since Moses is dead, the whole burden has now devolved upon thee, take the place of him to whom thou has been appointed successor; the other, although Moses is dead, do not desist, but go forward. I prefer the former, as containing the inference that he should, by right of succession, take up the office which Moses had left vacant. <span class="cite-ref">(15)</span> The epithet or surname of <em>servant </em>applied to Moses, has respect to his government of the people and his exploits; for it ought to be accommodated to actual circumstances. <span class="cite-ref">(16)</span> The allusion here is not to the Law but to the leadership, which had passed to Joshua by the decease of Moses, and God thus acknowledges his servant, not so much with the view of praising him, as of strengthening the authority of Joshua, who had been substituted in his place. And as the people might not have acquiesced sufficiently in a bare command, he promises, while ordering them to pass the Jordan, to give them peaceable possession of the whole country, and of every spot of it on which they should plant their foot. For as nothing tends more than distrust to make us sluggish and useless, so when God holds forth a happy issue, confidence inspires us with rigor for any attempt. </p><p>It may be added, that he does now begin for the first time to give them good hopes, by making a promise of which they had not previously heard, but recalls to their remembrance what Moses had formerly testified. He says, therefore, that the time had now come for exhibiting and performing that which he had promised to Moses. Should any one object that the same thing had been said to Abraham long before Moses was born, nay, that the perpetual covenant deposited with Abraham included everything which was heard by Moses four hundred years after; <span class="cite-ref">(17)</span> I answer, that here no notice is taken of the ancient promise which was everywhere known and celebrated, and that Moses is produced as a witness whose memory was more recent, and by whose death the confidence of the people might have been shaken, had not God declared that the accomplishment of all which he had said was at hand. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(15)</span> “Which Moses had left vacant.” Latin, “Ex qua decesserat Moses.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">De laquelle Moyse estoit sorti ayant fait son temps</span>;” “Which Moses had left, having held his own time of it.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(16)</span> “To actual circumstances.” Latin, “Ad circumstantiam loci.” French, “A la circonstance du passage;” “To the circumstance of the passage.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(17)</span> The French here gives the same meaning in a paraphrastic form, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ou mesmes qu’a parler proprement, tout ce qui a este dit a Moyse dependoit de l’alliance perpetuelle que Dieu avoit mise en garde entre les mains d’Abraham quatre cens ans auparavant</span>.” “Or even, to speak properly, all that was said to Moses depended on the perpetual covenant which God had deposited in the hands of Abraham four hundred years before.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
