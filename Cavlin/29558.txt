<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Let it be read in the Church of the Laodiceans. </em>Hence, though it was addressed to the Colossians, it was, nevertheless, necessary that it should be profitable to others. The same view must also be taken of all the Epistles. They were indeed, in the first instance, addressed to particular Churches, but, as they contain doctrine that is always in force, and is common to all ages, it is of no importance what title they bear, for the subject matter belongs to us. It has been groundlessly supposed that the other Epistle of which he makes mention was written by Paul, and those labor under a double mistake who think that it was written by Paul to the Laodiceans. I have no doubt that it was an Epistle that had been sent to Paul, the perusal of which might be profitable to the Colossians, as neighboring towns have usually many things in common. There was, however, an exceedingly gross imposture in the circumstance that some worthless person, I know not who, had the audacity to forge, under this pretext, an Epistle, that is so insipid, <span class="cite-ref">(481)</span> that nothing can be conceived to be more foreign to Paul’s spirit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(481)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Contrefaire et mettre en auant vne lettre comme escrite par sainct Paul aux Laodiciens, voire si sotte et badine</span>;” — “To forge and put forward a letter as if written by St. Paul to the Laodiceans, and that too so foolish and silly.” </p></div></div>
