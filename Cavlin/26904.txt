<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Cast the net on the right side of the ship. </em>Christ does not command with authority and power as <em>Master </em>and <em>Lord, </em>but gives advice like one of the people; and the disciples, being at a loss what to do, readily obey him, though they did not know who he was. If, before the first <em>casting of the net, </em>any thing of this sort had been said to them, they would not have so quickly obeyed. I mention this, that no one may wonder that they were so submissive, for they had already been worn out by long and useless toil. Yet it was no small proof of patience and perseverance, that, though they had labored unsuccessfully during the whole night, they continue their toil after the return of daylight. And, indeed, if we wish to allow an opportunity for the blessing of God to descend on us, we ought constantly to expect it; for nothing can be more unreasonable than to withdraw the hand immediately from labor, if it do not give promise of success. </p><p>That <em>Simon Peter </em>Was Naked, is a proof that the disciples had labored in earnest; and yet they do not hesitate to <em>cast the net </em>again to make another trial, that they may not neglect any opportunity. Their obedience to the command of Christ cannot be ascribed to faith; for they hear him speak as a person who was unknown to them. Now, if we dislike our calling, because the labor which we undertake appears to be unproductive, yet, when the Lord exhorts us to steadiness and perseverance, we ought to take courage; in the end we shall obtain a happy result, but it will be at the proper time. </p><p><em>And now they were not able to draw it </em><span class="cite-ref">(228)</span> Christ here exhibited two proofs of his Divine power. The first consisted in their taking so large a draught of fishes; and the second was, when, by his concealed power, he preserved the <em>net </em>whole, which otherwise must unavoidably have been broken in pieces. Other circumstances are mentioned, namely, that the disciples find burning coals on the shore, that fishes are laid on them, and that bread is also prepared. As to the number of <em>the fishes, </em>we ought not to look for any deep mystery in it. Augustine enters into ingenious reasonings about the statement of the number, and says that it denotes the Law and the Gospel; but if we examine the matter carefully, we shall find that this is childish trifling. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(228)</span> In the Latin original of the Commentaries, the illustration of this clause comes before that of the 7<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse; but I have consulted the convenience of the reader, by following the French version, which, in this respect, may be supposed to give us the latest thoughts of the Author., and in which this clause is restored to its natural order. â€” <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
