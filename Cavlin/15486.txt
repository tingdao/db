<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>Confounded be all those who serve graven images. </em>The Psalmist draws a broad distinction here, as in the psalm next to this, between the true God and the false gods which men form for themselves. This he does that the praise which he had ascribed might not be applied to any but the true God. Men are all ready to admit that they ought to celebrate the praises of God, but, naturally prone as they are to superstition, few indeed will be bound down to worship God in the manner which is right. No sooner have they to do with God than they deviate into the most baseless delusions. Each fashions a god for himself, and all choose what suits them best in the medley of inventions. This is the reason why the sacred writers, under the apprehension that men may turn to false gods, are careful in giving exhortations to the worship of God, to state at the same time who the true God is. The order observed by the Psalmist suggests the remark, that corrupt superstitions will never be removed until the true religion obtains. Prevented from coming to the true God by the slowness of their spiritual apprehension, men cannot fail to wander in vanities of their own; and it is the knowledge of the true God which dispels these, as the sun disperses the darkness. All have naturally a something of religion born with them, <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> but owing to the blindness and stupidity, as well as the weakness of our minds, the apprehension which we conceive of God is immediately depraved. Religion is thus the beginning of all superstitions, not in its own nature, but through the darkness which has settled down upon the minds of men, and which prevents them from distinguishing between idols and the true God. The truth of God is effectual when revealed in dispelling and dissipating superstitions. Does the sun absorb the vapors which intervene in the air, and shall not the presence of God himself be effectual much more? We need not wonder then that the Psalmist, in predicting the Kingdom of God, triumphs over the ungodly nations, which boasted in graven images, as when Isaiah, speaking of the rise of the Gospel, adds, </p><p>“Then all the idols of Egypt shall fall,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_19:1</span>) </p><p>Since the knowledge of God has been hid from the view of men, we are taught also that there is no reason to be surprised at the host of superstitions which have overspread the world. We have an exemplification of the same truth in our own day. The knowledge of the true doctrine is extinguished amongst the Turks, the Jews, and Papists, and, as a necessary consequence, they lie immersed in error; for they cannot possibly return to a sound mind, or repent of their errors, when they are ignorant of the true God. When the Psalmist speaks of their being <em>confounded, </em>he means that the time was come when those who were given to idolatry should repent, and return to the worship of the true God. Not that all without exception would be brought to genuine repentance, — for experience has taught us in these our own times how atheistical men <span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> will cast off superstition, and yet assume the most shameless effrontery, but that this is one of those consequences which the knowledge of God should effect, the turning of men from their errors unto God. Some there are who obstinately resist God, of which we have many examples in the Papacy; but we have every reason to believe that they are secretly prostrated by that which they affect to despise, and confounded notwithstanding their opposition. What the Psalmist says a little after, <em>Let all the gods </em><span class="cite-ref">(102)</span><em>worship before him, </em>properly applies to the angels, in whom there shines forth some small portion of divinity, yet it may, though less appropriately, be extended to fictitious gods; as if he had said, Whatever is accounted or held as a god must quit its place and renounce its claims, that God alone may be exalted. Hence it may be gathered that the true definition of piety is, when the true God is perfectly served, and when he alone is so exalted, that no creature obscures his divinity; and, accordingly, if we would not have true piety entirely destroyed amongst us, we must hold by this principle, That no creature whatever be exalted by us beyond measure, </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(100)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les hommes ont naturellement quelque religion</span>,” etc. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span> “Lucianici homines.” — <em>Lat</em>. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Disciples de Lucian et Atheistes</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(102)</span> With the exception of the Chaldee, which, instead of “gods,” has “people,” all the ancient versions translate <em>angels </em>— <em>all his angels</em>, as if the Hebrew reading had originally been <span class="lang he-il">כל מלאכיו</span>, and not as in our present copies <span class="lang he-il">כל אלהים</span>. It has indeed been questioned whether <span class="lang he-il">אלהים</span>, <em>elohim</em>, can be correctly translated <em>angels </em>The most of modern lexicographers and critics reject this sense of the word. “But usage, after all,” says Moses Stuart, “pleads in favor of it. The Septuagint render <span class="lang he-il">אל</span> (God) by <span class="lang el-gr">ἄγγελος</span>, in <span class="bvs">Job_20:15</span>; and <span class="lang he-il">אלהים</span> by <span class="lang el-gr">ἄγγελοι</span>, in <span class="bvs">Psa_8:6</span>. Paul follows them by quoting <span class="bvs">Psa_8:6</span> in <span class="bvs">Heb_2:7</span>; and also by quoting <span class="bvs">Psa_97:7</span> in <span class="bvs">Heb_1:6</span>; <em>i e</em>. , supposing that he does actually quote it. Is not this sufficient evidence that there was a <em>usus loquendi </em> among the Jews, which applied the word <span class="lang he-il">אלהים</span> occasionally to designate <em>angels </em>? It is admitted that kings and magistrates are called <em>elohim</em>, because of their rank or dignity. Is there any thing improbable in the supposition that angels may be also called <span class="lang he-il">אלהים</span>, who at present are elevated above men, <span class="bvs">Heb_2:7</span> ?” </p><p>Stuart, in the above remarks, speaks as if it were doubtful whether Paul in <span class="bvs">Heb_1:6</span>, “And again, when he bringeth the first-begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him,” quotes from the 7<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse of the 97<span class="cite-ref">th</span> Psalm. Commentators are divided in opinion on this point, some maintaining that the quotation is from <span class="bvs">Psa_97:0</span>, and others that it is from <span class="bvs">Deu_32:43</span>, in the Septuagint version, where the very words are found which appear in <span class="bvs">Heb_1:6</span>, although <em>only </em>in that version; the Hebrew and all the ancient versions being without them. One difficulty attending the supposition of his quoting from <span class="bvs">Deu_32:43</span> is, that the subject connected with this command to the angels (if we admit the clause in the Septuagint to be a part of the sacred text) has no relation to the Messiah. The context celebrates the victory over the enemies of Israel, which God will achieve. After saying that ‘his arms should be drunk with blood, and that his sword should devour flesh with the blood of the slain and of captives, from the time when he begins to take vengeance on the enemy,’ the Septuagint (not the Hebrew) immediately inserts, <span class="lang el-gr">εὐφράνθητε οὐρανοὶ ἅμα αὐτῷ καὶ προκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες ἄγγελοι θεοῦ</span>. This in the place where it stands must mean, “Let the inhabitants of the heavenly world rejoice in the victory of God over the enemies of his people, and let them pay their adoration to him.” But the Messiah does not seem to be at all alluded to any where in the context, much less described as being <em>introduced into the world </em>It is not therefore very likely that this is the passage quoted, unless we suppose that Paul borrowed the words merely as fitted to express the idea which he intended to convey, without any reference to their original meaning. The probability is in favor of a quotation from the text before us; which in the Septuagint runs thus: <span class="lang el-gr">προσκυνήσατε αὐτῷ πάντες ἄγγελοι αὐτοῦ</span>. Paul’s words are, <span class="lang el-gr">και προσκυνησάτώσαν αὐτῷ παντες ἄγγελοι Θεοῦ</span>. Here the variation from the Septuagint is so very inconsiderable, making no change upon the sense of the passage, that the discrepancy, especially when it is considered that very few of the quotations from the Old Testament in the New agree <em>verbatim </em> either with the Hebrew or Septuagint, is no argument against the supposition of the Apostle’s quoting this text from that version which was in general use among the Jews. And this psalm admits of an easy application to the coming and kingdom of the Messiah, whose advent was to destroy idolatry, and be the source of rejoicing and happiness to all the righteous, which the passage in Deuteronomy referred to does not. — See <em>Stuart </em>’<em>s Commentary </em>on <span class="bvs">Heb_1:6</span>, and <em>Excursus </em>6. </p></div></div>
