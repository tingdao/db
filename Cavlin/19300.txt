<div class="comment-content"><p>The same thing is said of the wild asses, <em>And the wild asses, </em>he says, <em>stood on the rocks: </em>and yet this animal, we know, can endure want for a long Lime. But the Prophet, as I have said, intended to shew that there would be in this scarcity some remarkable evidences of God’s vengeance. <em>Stood </em>then <em>did the wild asses on the rocks, </em>and <em>thence drew in wind like serpents: </em>for great is the heat of serpents; on account of inward burning they are constrained to draw in wind to allay the heat within. The Prophet says, that wild asses were like serpents, for they were burning with long famine, so that they were seeking food in the wind itself, or by respiration. He then adds, <em>Failed have their eyes, for there was no grass </em><span class="cite-ref">(108)</span></p><p>We now understand the object of this prediction: It was God’s purpose not only to foretell the Jews what was soon to be, but also to point out, as it were, by the finger, his vengeance, that they might not have recourse, as usual, to secondary causes, but that they might know that they suffered punishment for their sins; for the scarcity would be so extraordinary as far to exceed what was usual. It now follows — </p><p><strong>(108)</strong> The three foregoing verses I render as follows, — </p><p><strong>4.</strong>On account of the ground being cracked, As there has been no rain in the land, Ashamed were the husbandmen, They covered their heads: </p><p><strong>5.</strong>When also the hind <em>was </em>in the field, It brought forth young, and it was forsaken, Because there was no grass: </p><p><strong>6.</strong>And the wild asses, they stood on the cliffs; They drew in the wind like serpents; Fail did their eyes, Because there was no herbage </p><p>— <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
