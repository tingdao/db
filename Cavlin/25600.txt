<div class="comment-content"><p>This parable is nothing else than a confirmation of the preceding doctrine. <span class="cite-ref">(520)</span> In the first part is shown how readily God is disposed to pardon our sins, and in the second part (which we shall afterwards treat in the proper place) is shown the great malignity and obstinacy of those who murmur at his compassion. In the person of a young prodigal who, after having been reduced to the deepest poverty by luxury and extravagance, returns as a suppliant to his father, <span class="cite-ref">(521)</span> to whom he had been disobedient and rebellious, Christ describes all sinners who, wearied of their folly, apply to the grace of God. To the kind father, <span class="cite-ref">(522)</span> on the other hand, who not only pardons the crimes of his son, but of his own accord meets him when returning, he compares God, who is not satisfied with pardoning those who pray to him, but even advances to meet them with the compassion of a father. <span class="cite-ref">(523)</span> Let us now examine the parable in detail. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(520)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De la doctrine que nous venons de voir</span>;” — “of the doctrine which we have just now seen.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(521)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Retourne pour demander pardon a son pere</span>;” — “returns to ask pardon from his father.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(522)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Aussi en la personne de ce bon pere il nous propose l’affection de Dieu</span>;” — “also in the person of this good father he holds out to us the affection of God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(523)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais les previent par sa bonte et misericorde paternelle</span>;” — “but anticipates them by his fatherly goodness and compassion.” </p></div></div>
