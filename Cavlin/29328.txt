<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>But, as the church is subject to Christ</em>. The particle <em>but, </em>may lead some to believe that the words, <em>he is the savior of the body, </em>are intended to anticipate an objection. Christ has, no doubt, this peculiar claim, that he is the Savior of the Church: nevertheless, let wives know, that their husbands, though they cannot produce equal claims, have authority over them, after the example of Christ. I prefer the former interpretation; for the argument derived from the word <em>but, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">ἀλλά,</span>) does not appear to me to have much weight. </p></div>
