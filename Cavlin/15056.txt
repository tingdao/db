<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>They have set fire to thy sanctuaries. </em>The Psalmist now complains that the temple was burned, and thus completely razed and destroyed, whereas it was only half demolished by the instruments of war. Many have supposed that the order of the words has been here inverted, <span class="cite-ref">(224)</span> not being able to perceive how a suitable meaning could be elicited from them, and therefore would resolve them thus, <em>They have put fire into thy sanctuaries. </em>I have, however, no doubt that the sense which I have given, although the accent is against it, is the true and natural one, That the temple was levelled with the ground by being burned. This verse corroborates more fully the statement which I have made, that the temple is called <em>sanctuaries </em>in the plural number, because it consisted of three parts, — the innermost sanctuary, the middle sanctuary, and the outer court; for there immediately follows the expression, <em>The dwelling-place of thy name. </em>The name of God is here employed to teach us that his essence was not confined to or shut up in the temple, but that he dwelt in it by his power and operation, that the people might there call upon him with the greater confidence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(224)</span> The order of the words is this, <span class="lang he-il">שלחו באש מקדשך</span><em>shilchu baesh mikdashecha</em>, literally, “They have sent into fire thy sanctuary.” </p></div></div>
