<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>At the commandment of the Lord. </em><span class="cite-ref">(2)</span> The <em>mouth </em>is here used by metonymy for the speech; nor does there appear to me to be so much harshness in the Hebraism, but that it may be appropriately retained. But it is asked whether God actually spoke or not; for the word <em>mouth </em>is often repeated. It is indeed likely that Moses was instructed but <em>once </em>what was meant by the removal or remaining of the cloud; yet I doubt not but that the name of <em>word, </em>or <em>commandment, </em>was given to the sign, inasmuch as God speaks as much to the eyes by outward signs as He does to the ears by His voice. Still, from this mode of expression we may gather that the use of signs <span class="cite-ref">(3)</span> is perverted and nullified, unless they are taken to be visible doctrine, as Augustin writes. The repetition, which certainly has no little force, shows how worthy this is of observation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(2)</span> “At the mouth of the Lord.” — <em>Lat. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(3)</span> “Des sacremens.” — <em>Fr. </em>I cannot find that Augustin anywhere uses the exact words which <em>C. </em>here attributes to him. In his <em>Tract. in Evang. Johan., </em>80. Section 3, however, he says, “Detrahe verbum, et quid est aqua nisi aqua? Accedit verbum ad elementum, et fit sacramentum, etiam ipsum tanquam <em>visibile verbum</em>. ” (Edit. Bened. vol. 3, part. 2, p. 703.) And again, <em>Contra Faustum, lib. </em>19. <em>cap. </em>16: “Quid enim sunt aliud quaeque corporalia sacramenta, nisi quaedam quasi <em>verba visibiliar? </em>Etc. Vol. 8:32l. Both these passages are quoted by <em>C. Inst. </em>4, 14. Section 6. </p></div></div>
