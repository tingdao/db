<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Paul, called to be an Apostle </em>In this manner does Paul proceed, in almost all the introductions to his Epistles, with the view of procuring for his doctrine authority and favor. The former he secures to himself from the station that had been assigned to him by God, as being an Apostle of Christ sent by God; the latter by testifying his affection towards those to whom he writes. We believe much more readily the man whom we look upon as regarding us with affection, and as faithfully endeavoring to promote our welfare. In this salutation, therefore, he claims for himself authority, when he speaks of himself as <em>an Apostle of Christ</em>, and that, too, as <em>called by God</em>, that is, set apart <em>by the will of God </em>Now, two things are requisite in any one that would be listened to in the Church, and would occupy the place of a teacher; for he must be <em>called </em>by God to that office, and he must faithfully employ himself in the discharge of its duties. Paul here lays claim to both. For the name, <em>Apostle</em>, implies that the individual conscientiously acts the part of an ambassador for Christ (<span class="bvs">2Co_5:19</span>), and proclaims the pure doctrine of the gospel. But as no one ought to assume this honor to himself, unless he be <em>called </em>to it, he adds, that he had not rashly intruded into it, but had been appointed <span class="cite-ref">(36)</span> to it by God. </p><p>Let us learn, therefore, to take these two things together when we wish to ascertain what kind of persons we ought to esteem as ministers of Christ, — a call to the office, and faithfulness in the discharge of its duties. For as no man can lawfully assume the designation and rank of a minister, unless he be called, so it were not enough for any one to be called, if he does not also fulfill the duties of his office. For the Lord does not choose ministers that they may be dumb idols, or exercise tyranny under pretext of their calling, or make their own caprice their law; but at the same time marks out what kind of persons they ought to be, and binds them by his laws, and in fine chooses them for the ministry, or, in other words, that in the first place they may not be idle, and, secondly, that they may confine themselves within the limits of their office. Hence, as the apostleship depends on the <em>calling</em>, so the man who would be reckoned an apostle, must show himself to be really such: nay more, so must every one who demands that credit be given him, or that his doctrine be listened to. For since Paul rests on these arguments for establishing his authority, worse than impudent were the conduct of that man who would think to have any standing without such proofs. </p><p>It ought, however, to be observed, that it is not enough for any one to hold out to view the title to a call to the office, along with faithfulness in discharging its duties, if he does not in reality give proof of both. For it often happens that none boast more haughtily of their titles than those that are destitute of the reality; as of old the false prophets, with lofty disdain, boasted that they had been sent by the Lord. Nay, at the present day, what else do the Romanists make a noise about, but “ordination from God, and an inviolably sacred succession even from the Apostles themselves,” <span class="cite-ref">(37)</span> while, after all, it appears that they are destitute of those things of which they vaunt? Here, therefore, it is not boasting that is required, but reality. Now, as the name is assumed by good and bad alike, we must come to the test, that we may ascertain who has a right to the name of Apostle, and who has not. As to Paul, God attested his <em>calling </em>by many revelations, and afterwards confirmed it by miracles. The <em>faithfulness </em>must be estimated by this, — whether or not he proclaimed the pure doctrine of Christ. As to the twofold call — that of God and that of the Church — see my Institutes. <span class="cite-ref">(38)</span></p><p><em>An Apostle </em>Though this name, agreeably to its etymology, has a general signification, and is sometimes employed in a general sense, to denote any kind of ministers, <span class="cite-ref">(39)</span> yet, as a peculiar designation, it is applicable to those that were set apart by the Lord’s appointment to publish the Gospel throughout the whole world. Now, it was of importance that Paul should be reckoned in that number, for two <em>reasons</em>, — <em>first</em>, because much more deference was paid to them than to other ministers of the gospel; and, <em>secondly</em>, because they alone, properly speaking, had authority to instruct all the Churches. </p><p><em>By the will of God </em>While the Apostle is accustomed cheerfully to <em>acknowledge </em>himself indebted to God for whatever he has of good, he does so more especially in reference to his apostleship, that he may free himself from all appearance of presumption. And assuredly as a call to salvation is of grace, so also a call to the office of apostle is of grace, as Christ teaches in these words: </p><p>“Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_15:16</span>.) </p><p>Paul, however, at the same time indirectly intimates, that all who attempt to undermine his apostleship, or in any way oppose it, contend against an appointment of God. For Paul here makes no useless boast of honorary titles, but designedly vindicates his apostleship from malicious aspersions. For as his authority must have been sufficiently established in the view of the Corinthians, it would have been superfluous to make particular mention of “the will of God,” had not <em>wicked </em>men attempted by indirect means to undermine that honorable rank which had been divinely assigned him. </p><p><em>And Sosthenes our brother </em>This is that Sosthenes who was ruler of the Jewish synagogue that was at Corinth, of whom <em>Luke </em>makes mention in <span class="bvs">Act_18:17</span>. His name is added for this reason, that the Corinthians, knowing his ardor and steadfastness in the gospel, could not but hold him in deserved esteem, and hence it is still more to his honor to be made mention of now as Paul’s <em>brother</em>, than formerly as <em>ruler of the synagogue </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(36)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Constitue, ordonne, et establi</span>;” — “Appointed, ordained, and established.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(37)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et aujour d’huy, qu’est ce qu’entonnent a plene bouche les Romanisques, sinon cen gros mots, Ordination de Dieu, La sainte et sacree succession depuis le temps mesme des Apostres</span>;” — “And at the present day, what do the Romanists sound forth with open mouth, but those grand terms, Ordination from God, — The holy and sacred succession from the very times of the Apostles.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(38)</span><em>Institutes</em>, volume 3. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(39)</span><span class="lang el-gr">Αποστολος</span>, (an apostle) derived from <span class="lang el-gr">αποστελλειν</span>, (to send forth,) signifies literally a messenger.
