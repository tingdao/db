<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>For </em><span class="cite-ref">(42)</span><em>revealed</em>, <em>etc. </em>He reasons now by stating things of a contrary nature, and proves that there is no righteousness except what is conferred, or comes through the gospel; for he shows that without this all men are condemned: by it alone there is salvation to be found. And he brings, as the first proof of condemnation, the fact, — that though the structure of the world, and the most beautiful arrangement of the elements, ought to have induced man to glorify God, yet no one discharged his proper duty: it hence appears that all were guilty of sacrilege, and of wicked and abominable ingratitude. </p><p>To some it seems that this is a main subject, and that Paul forms his discourse for the purpose of enforcing repentance; but I think that the discussion of the subject begins here, and that the principal point is stated in a former proposition; for Paul’s object was to teach us where salvation is to be found. He has already declared that we cannot obtain it except through the gospel: but as the flesh will not willingly humble itself so far as to assign the praise of salvation to the grace of God alone, Paul shows that the whole world is deserving of eternal death. It hence follows, that life is to be recovered in some other way, since we are all lost in ourselves. But the words, being well considered, will help us much to understand the meaning of the passage. </p><p>Some make a difference between <em>impiety </em>and <em>unrighteousness</em>, and think, that by the former word is meant the profanation of God’s worship, and by the latter, injustice towards men; but as the Apostle immediately refers this unrighteousness to the neglect of true religion, we shall explain both as referring to the same thing. <span class="cite-ref">(43)</span> And then,<em>all the impiety of men </em>is to be taken, by a figure in language, as meaning “the impiety of all men,” or, the impiety of which all men are guilty. But by these two words one thing is designated, and that is, ingratitude towards God; for we thereby offend in two ways: it is said to be <span class="lang el-gr">ἀσέβεια</span>, impiety, as it is a dishonoring of God; it is <span class="lang el-gr">ἀδικία</span>, unrighteousness, because man, by transferring to himself what belongs to God, unjustly deprives God of his glory. The word <em>wrath</em>, according to the usage of Scripture, speaking after the manner of men, means the vengeance of God; for God, in punishing, has, according to our notion, the appearance of one in wrath. It imports, therefore, no such emotion in God, but only has a reference to the perception and feeling of the sinner who is punished. Then he says that it is<em>revealed from heaven; </em>though the expression,<em>from heaven</em>, is taken by some in the sense of an adjective, as though he had said “the wrath of the celestial God;” yet I think it more emphatical, when taken as having this import, “Wheresoever a man may look around him, he will find no salvation; for the wrath of God is poured out on the whole world, to the full extent of heaven.” </p><p><em>The truth of God </em>means, the true knowledge of God; and to <em>hold in </em>that, is to suppress or to obscure it: hence they are charged as guilty of robbery. — What we render<em>unjustly</em>, is given literally by Paul, <em>in unrighteousness</em>, which means the same thing in Hebrew: but we have regard to perspicuity. <span class="cite-ref">(44)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(42)</span> The connection here is not deemed very clear. [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] thinks that this verse is connected, as the former one, with <span class="bvs">Rom_1:16</span>. and that it includes a reason why the Apostle was not ashamed of the gospel: and [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] seems to have been of the same opinion, for he renders<span class="lang el-gr">γαρ, </span><em>besides. </em>In this case the revelation of wrath from heaven is that which is made by the gospel. This certainly gives a meaning to the words, “from heaven” which is hardly done by any other views. That the gospel reveals “wrath,” as well as righteousness to be obtained by faith, is what is undeniable. Salvation to the believer, and condemnation to the unbeliever, is its sum and substance. The objection made by [<span class="bvs">Haldane </span>] is of no force, — that the Apostle subsequently shows the sins of mankind as committed against the light of nature, and not against the gospel; for he seems to have brought forward the evidence from the light of nature, in order to confirm the evidence from the light of revelation. The expression is, “Revealed <em>is </em>the wrath of God,” and not <em>has been</em>. See <span class="bvs">Act_17:30</span></p><p>This is the view taken by [<span class="bvs">Turrettin </span>]; and [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] says, “There is nothing to prevent us from referring the revelation of wrath, as well as the revelation of righteousness, to the gospel” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(43)</span> It is true that the immediate subject is the neglect of religion; but then injustice towards men is afterwards introduced, and most critics take it in this sense. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(44)</span> This clause<span class="lang el-gr">, τῶν τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἐν ἀδικία κατεχόντων </span> is differently rendered, “Veritatem injuste detinentes — unjustly detaining the truth,” [<span class="bvs">Turrettin </span>] <em>; </em>“Who stifle the truth in unrighteousness,” [<span class="bvs">Chalmers </span>] <em>; </em>“Who hinder the truth by unrighteousness,” [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>]; “Who wickedly oppose the truth,” [<span class="bvs">Hodge </span>] <em>; </em>“Who confine the truth by unrighteousness,” [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] </p><p>“They rushed headlong,” says [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>], “into impiety against God and into injustice against one another, not through ignorance, but knowingly, not through weakness, but willfully and maliciously: and this the Apostle expresses by a striking metaphor, taken from tyrants, who, against right and justice, by open violence, oppress the innocent, bind them in chains, and detain them in prison.” </p><p>The sense given by [<span class="bvs">Schleusner </span>] and some others, “Qui cum veri Dei cognitione pravitatem vitæ conjungunt — who connect with a knowledge of the true God a wicked life,” seems not to comport with the context. </p><p>“The truth” means that respecting the being and power of God afterwards specified. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
