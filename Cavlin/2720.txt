<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons </em>I have already expounded all that might seem to be profitable with respect to the garments and the mode of anointing; only let; my readers remember that the priest, <span class="cite-ref">(398)</span> who had been before appointed, is now at length inaugurated, in order that he may begin the discharge of his office. At the same time, let them also bear in mind that this oil was consecrated by God. Hence it appears how foolishly the Popish bishops, as it were, ape Moses, when, in imitation of him, they sprinkle their priests and altars and other rubbish with stinking oil, since it is abundantly clear that this ceremony of anointing, belonging as it did to the ancient shadows of the Law, ceased at the coming of Christ. What Augustine <span class="cite-ref">(399)</span> reminds us of is also worthy of observation, that Moses, who is commissioned to anoint the others, was never consecrated himself by any visible symbol, in order that we may understand that outward signs are not to be estimated by the dignity of the minister, but only by the ordinance of God; and again, that invisible grace has profited some without visible sacraments, whilst visible sanctification may be imparted, but cannot profit, without invisible. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(398)</span> “Aaron, ayant este cree auparavant Sacrificateur.” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(399)</span> Quaest. in <span class="bvs">Lev_84:0</span>.
