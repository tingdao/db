Nay more, he closes the preceding admonition with the same statement, which he had made use of by way of preface. For what is meant by the expressions<em>Receive us, </em>or <em>Make room for us? </em>It is equivalent to, <em>Be ye enlarged, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_6:13</span>;) that is, “Do not allow corrupt affections, or unfavorable apprehensions, to prevent this doctrine from making its way into your minds, and obtaining a place within you. For as I lay myself out for your salvation with a fatherly zeal, it were unseemly that you should turn a deaf ear <span class="cite-ref">(630)</span> upon me.” <span class="cite-ref">(631)</span></p><p><em>We have done injury to no man. </em>He <em>declares </em>that there is no reason why they should have their minds alienated, <span class="cite-ref">(632)</span> inasmuch as he had not given them occasion of offense in any thing. Now he mentions <em>three </em>kinds of offenses, as to which he declares himself to be guiltless. The <em>first </em>is, manifest hurt or injury. The <em>second </em>is, the corruption that springs from false doctrine. The <em>third </em>is, defrauding or cheating in worldly goods. These are <em>three </em>things by which, for the most part, pastors <span class="cite-ref">(633)</span> are wont to alienate the minds of the people from them — when they conduct themselves in an overbearing manner, and, making their authority their pretext, break forth into tyrannical cruelty or <em>unreasonableness, </em>— <em>or </em>when they draw aside from the right path those to whom they ought to have been guides, and infect them with the corruption of false doctrine, — or when they manifest an insatiable covetousness, by eagerly desiring what belongs to another. Should any one wish to have it in shorter compass-the <em>first </em>is, fierceness and an abuse of power by excessive <em>insolence </em><span class="cite-ref">(634)</span> the <em>second, </em>unfaithfulness in teaching. the <em>third, </em>avarice. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(630)</span> “Indignum esset me surdis fabulam canere;” — “It were unseemly that I should be like one that tells a story to the deaf.” A similar expression is made use of by Horace, (<span class="cite-note">Ep. 2, 1, 200</span>,) — “Scriptores autem narrare putaret asello fabellam surdo;” — “But he would think that the writers were telling a story to a deaf ass.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(631)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que ie perdisse mon temps en vous admonestant</span>;” — “That I should lose my time in admonishing you.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(632)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De luy ou de sa doctrine</span>;” — “From him or from his doctrine.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(633)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les ministres et pasteurs</span>;” — “Ministers and pastors.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(634)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand on est arrogant, et on abuse de la puissance en se desbordant et vsurpant plus qu’il ne faut</span>;” — “When one is presumptuous, and abuses his power by going beyond bounds and assuming more than he ought.” </p></div></div>
