<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Be thou pleased, O Jehovah! to deliver me. </em>The verb which David here makes use of, signifies to desire a thing from pure kindness and good-will. <span class="cite-ref">(96)</span> He desires, therefore, to be delivered by the free mercy of God. As to his desire, that God would <em>make haste, </em>we have elsewhere spoken of it. Even when God delays to help us, it is our duty to contend against a feeling of weariness; but such is his goodness, that he permits us to use this form of prayer, That he would make haste according to our desires. Then, according to his usual practice, citing his enemies to the judgment-seat of God, he feels confident, that, on account of their cruelty, and unjust and wicked hatred, he shall obtain what he asks. We must maintain it as a fixed principle, that the more unjustly our enemies afflict us, and the more cruelly they wrong us, God is so much the more disposed to give us help. And it is no slight consolation that the mercy of God strives against their wickedness, so that the more fiercely our enemies pursue us to effect our hurt, the more ready is he to bring us help. We have already frequently spoken of the feelings with which David uttered these imprecations, and it is necessary here again to refresh our memories on the subject, lest any man, when giving loose reins to his passions, should allege the example of David in palliation or excuse. This wicked and counterfeit imitation on the part of those who follow the powerful impulse of the flesh, instead of being guided by the zeal of the Spirit, is always to be held up to condemnation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(96)</span> “<span class="lang he-il">רצה</span>,<em>retse</em>, <em>be pleased </em>From <span class="lang he-il">רצה</span>, <em>ratsah</em>, <em>he wished well</em>, <em>was pleased</em>, <em>accepted</em>, excluding any merit as a ground for that acceptance.” —<em>Bythner </em>’<em>s Lyra </em></p></div></div>
