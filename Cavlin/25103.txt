<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_4:39</span><strong>.</strong><em>He rebuked the fever. </em>To a person not well acquainted with Scripture this mode of expression may appear harsh; but there were good reasons for employing it. <em>Fevers </em>and other diseases, famine, pestilence, and calamities of every description, are God’s heralds, <span class="cite-ref">(347)</span> by whom he executes his judgments. Now, as he is said to send such messengers by his command and pleasure, so he also restrains and recalls them whenever he pleases. The manner in which he healed them is not mentioned by Matthew and Mark: but Luke says, that it was by <em>laying hands on each of them. </em>Under the Law, this was a sign of reconciliation; and, therefore, it was not improperly, or unseasonably, that Christ <em>laid hands </em>on those whom he freed from the curse of God. It was also a solemn rite of consecration, as will afterwards be more fully explained. But I interpret Christ’s <em>laying hands </em>on the sick, as meaning simply, that he recommended them to the Father, and thus obtained for them grace and deliverance from their diseases. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(347)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les sergens de Dieu</span>;” — “God's bailiffs.” </p></div></div>
