<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_21:1</span><strong>.</strong><em>Then Jesus sent two disciples </em>Jesus <em>sends </em>his <em>disciples </em>to bring <em>an ass </em>to him, not because he was wearied with the journey, but for a different reason; for, in consequence of the time of his death being at hand, he intended to show, by a solemn performance, what was the nature of his kingdom. He had begun, indeed, to do this at his baptism, but it remained that this demonstration should be given by him towards the end of his calling: for why did he hitherto refrain from the title of <em>King, </em>and now at length openly declare himself to be a <em>King, </em>but because he is not far from the end of his course? <span class="cite-ref">(710)</span> So then, as his removal to heaven was at hand, he intended to commence his reign openly on earth. </p><p>This would have been a ridiculous display, if it had not been in accordance with the prediction of Zechariah, (<span class="bvs">Zec_9:9</span>.) In order to lay claim to the honors of royalty, he enters Jerusalem, <em>riding an ass. </em>A magnificent display, truly! more especially when <em>the ass </em>was borrowed from some person, and when the want of a saddle and of accouterments compelled the disciples to <em>throw their garments on it, </em>which was mark of mean and disgraceful poverty. He is attended, I admit, by a large retinue; but of what sort of people? Of those who had hastily assembled from the neighboring villages. Sounds of loud and joyful welcome are heard; <span class="cite-ref">(711)</span> but from whom? From the very poorest, and from those who belong to the despised multitude. One might think, therefore, that he intentionally exposed himself to the ridicule of all. But as he had two things to do at the same time, — as he had to exhibit some proof of his kingdom, and to show that it does not resemble earthly kingdoms, and does not consist of the fading riches of this world, it was altogether necessary for him to take this method. </p><p>To wicked men, no doubt, this might be very unacceptable, had not God long before testified by his Prophet that such would be the king who would come to restore the salvation of his people. In order, therefore, that the mean aspect of Christ may not hinder us from perceiving in this exhibition, <span class="cite-ref">(712)</span> his spiritual kingdom, let us keep before our eyes the heavenly prediction, by which God conferred more honor on his Son under the revolting aspect of a beggar, than if he had been decorated with all the dazzling ornaments of kings. Without this seasoning, we shall never have any relish for this history; and therefore there is great weight in the words of Matthew, when he says, that <em>the prediction of the Prophet was fulfilled </em><span class="cite-ref">(713)</span> Perceiving that it was hardly possible that men, who are too much devoted to wealth and splendor, should derive any advantage from this narrative, when viewed according to the feeling of the flesh, he leads them away from the simple contemplation of the fact to the consideration of the prophecy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(710)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource qu’il se voit estre bien pres du but de sa course</span>;” — “because he sees that he is very near the end of his course.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(711)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les voix retentissent pour luy faire honneur, et le recevoir en grande ioye et triomphe</span>;” — “voices resound to do him honor, and to receive him in great joy and triumph.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(712)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sous la couverture des choses yci recitees</span>;” — “under the disguise of the things here related.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(713)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand il dit que </span><em class="lang fr-fr">tout cela se faisoit afin que ce qui avoit este dit loaf le Prophete fust accompli </em><em>; </em>” — “when he says that <em>all this was done</em>, <em>in order that what had been said by the Prophet might be fulfilled</em>. <em>” </em></p></div></div>
