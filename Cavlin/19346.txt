<div class="comment-content"><p>This verse contains a reason for the preceding, — that every connection with that people would be accursed. Yet he states one thing more expressly, — that the time was come in which they were already deprived of all joy; for the ungodly, even when God most awfully threatens them, strengthen themselves in their security, hence God intended to give them some presage, that they might before the time know that the saddest calamities were at hand, by which every joy and gladness were to be taken away. </p><p>He then says, that the God of <em>hosts </em>and the <em>God of Israel </em>had spoken. He at the same time deprived them of all hope, though he called himself the God of Israel. Hypocrites were wont either to despise the power of God, or to abuse his goodness. Had not God checked them, they would have deemed as nothing what the prophets threatened; and how so? Because they depreciated, as far as they could, the power of God. Hence God says, that he is the God of <em>hosts. </em>But when they could not in their pride and haughtiness throw down, as it were the power of God, then they betook themselves to another asylum; they promised to themselves that he would deal indulgently with them; and thus they deceived themselves. Hence, on the other hand, God calls himself here the <em>God of Israel, </em>in order that they might know, that it was of no avail to them, that he had adopted the seed of Abraham; for they were not the children of Abraham, but aliens, as they had departed from his piety and faith. This served as a preface. </p><p>Now when he says, <span class="lang he-il">הנני</span>, <em>enni, Behold me, </em>he shews that the Jews had no reason to put off the time, and to indulge avain confidence; for vengeance was already come. <em>Behold me, </em>he says, he thus comes forth and testifies that he is already prepared to execute his judgment. <em>Behold me,</em>, he says, <em>taking away from this place, before your eyes, and in your days, </em>etc.; their destruction would happen in a short time and before their eyes. I am taking away, he says, <em>the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, </em><span class="cite-ref">(162)</span><em>the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride </em>Here by stating a part for the whole, he intimates that they would become like the dead rather than the living; for the continuance of the human race is preserved by marriage, as in the offspring mankind are as it were born again, who would otherwise perish daily. Since then there was no more time left for marriages, it was a token of final destruction. This is what the Prophet intimates, when he says, that God would cause the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride to cease, so that there would be no more any congratulations. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(162)</strong> Rather, “The voice of exultation and the voice of joy;” the most manifest display first — exultation; and then the most hidden feeling — joy. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
