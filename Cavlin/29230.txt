<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And you who were dead. </em>This is an<span class="lang el-gr">ἐπεξεργασία </span> of the former statements, that is, an exposition accompanied by an illustration. <span class="cite-ref">(118)</span> To bring home more effectually to the Ephesians the general doctrine of Divine grace, he reminds them of their former condition. This application consists of two parts. “Ye were formerly lost; but now God, by his grace, has rescued you from destruction.” And here we must observe, that, in laboring to give an impressive view of both of these parts, the apostle makes a break in the style by (<span class="lang el-gr">ὑπερβατὸν</span>) a transposition. There is some perplexity in the language; but, if we attend carefully to what the apostle says about those two parts, the meaning is clear. As to the first, he says that they <em>were dead; </em>and states, at the same time, the cause of the death — <em>trespasses and sins. </em><span class="cite-ref">(119)</span> He does not mean simply that they were in danger of death; but he declares that it was a real and present death under which they labored. As spiritual death is nothing else than the alienation of the soul from God, we are all born as dead men, and we live as dead men, until we are made partakers of the life of Christ, — agreeably to the words of our Lord, </p><p>“The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_5:25</span>) </p><p>The Papists, who are eager to seize every opportunity of undervaluing the grace of God, say, that while we are out of Christ, we are half dead. But we are not at liberty to set aside the declarations of our Lord and of the Apostle Paul, that, while we remain in Adam, we are entirely devoid of life; and that regeneration is a new life of the soul, by which it rises from the dead. Some kind of life, I acknowledge, does remain in us, while we are still at a distance from Christ; for unbelief does not altogether destroy the outward senses, or the will, or the other faculties of the soul. But what has this to do with the kingdom of God? What has it to do with a happy life, so long as every sentiment of the mind, and every act of the will, is death? Let this, then, be held as a fixed principle, that the union of our soul with God is the true and only life; and that out of Christ we are altogether dead, because sin, the cause of death, reigns in us. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(118)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il expose et esclarcit ce qu’il avoit dit ci-dessus</span>.” “He explains and illustrates what he had formerly said.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(119)</span> Classical writers employ the same metaphor, to denote not spiritual death, with which they were unacquainted, but the absence of moral principle, or utter ignorance of right and wrong. Thus Epictetus says, <span class="lang el-gr">νεκρὸς μὲν ὁ παιδευτὴς νεκροὶ δ ᾿ ὑμεῖς ὅτε χορτασθὢτε σήμερον, καθὢσθε κλαίοντες περὶ τὢς αὔριον πόθεν φάγητε.</span> “The instructor is dead, and you are dead. When you are satiated to-day, you sit down and weep about to-morrow, what you shall have to eat.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
