<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Undoubtedly, O Father </em>This expression removes every pretense for that licentiousness of inquiry, to which we are continually excited. There is nothing which we yield to God with greater difficulty, than that his will shall be regarded by us as the highest reason and justice. <span class="cite-ref">(63)</span> He frequently repeats, that his <em>judgments are a deep abyss, </em>(<span class="bvs">Psa_36:6</span>;) but we plunge with headlong violence into that depth, <span class="cite-ref">(64)</span> and if there is any thing that does not please us, we gnash our teeth, or murmur against him, and many even break out into open blasphemies. On the contrary, our Lord lays down to us this rule, that whatever God has determined must be regarded by us as right. <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span> This is sober wisdom, to acquiesce in the good pleasure of God as alone equal to a thousand arguments. <span class="cite-ref">(66)</span> Christ might indeed have brought forward the causes of that distinction, if there were any; but he is satisfied with the good pleasure of God, and inquires no farther why he calls to salvation <em>little children </em>rather than others, and composes his kingdom out of an obscure flock. <span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> Hence it is evident, that men direct their fury against Christ, when, on learning that some are freely chosen, and others are reprobated, by the will of God, they storm because they find it unpleasant to yield to God. <span class="cite-ref">(68)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(63)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour la derniere et souveraine raison, et pour Justice parfaite</span>;” — “for the last and supreme reason, and for perfect justice.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(64)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour sonder ce qui y est</span>;” — “to sound what is in it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(65)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que tout ce que Dieu a determine est bon et droict</span>;” — “that all that God has determined is good and right.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(66)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et cela est estre sage a sobriete, d’acquiescer au seul bon plaisir de Dieu, et nous y arrester paisiblement, plus que s’il y avoit dix mille raisons devant nos yeux</span>;” — “and this is to be wise to sobriety, to acquiesce in the good pleasure of God, and to rest calmly upon it, more than if there were ten thousand arguments before our eyes.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(67)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’une troupe de gens incognus, et de petite estime</span>;” — “from a flock of persons unknown and little esteemed.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(68)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vienent incontinent a tempester, pource quil leur fasche que Dieu ait le dernier mot</span>;” — “come immediately to storm, because it gives them uneasiness that God should have the last word.” </p></div></div>
