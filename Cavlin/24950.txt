First Luke relates, that Mary remained about three months with her cousin, â€” or, in other words, till the birth of the child: for it is probable that she had no other reason for staying so long, but to enjoy the exhibition of divine grace, which had been suggested to her by the angel for the confirmation of her faith. </p></div>
