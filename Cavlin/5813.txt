<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>And he said, The Lord came from, Sinai. </em><span class="cite-ref">(305)</span> In these words he reminds them that he is setting before them, a confirmation of the covenant, which God had made with them in this Law<em>, </em>and that it is nothing different from it; for this connection was of exceeding efficacy in establishing the certainty of the blessings, provided only the Law was duly honored; for nothing was better adapted to confirm the grace of God than the majesty which was displayed in the promulgation of the Law. Some, as I conceive improperly, translate it, — “God comes to Sinai,” whereas Moses rather means that he came from thence, when His brightness was made manifest. By way of ornament, the same thing is repeated with respect to Seir and Paran; and, since these three words are synonymous<em>, </em>therefore to <em>go forth, </em>to <em>rise up, </em>and to <em>come, </em>also represent the same thing, viz., that manifestation of the divine glory which should have ravished into admiration the minds of all; as though he had said that his blessings were to be received with the same reverence, as that which God had procured for His Law, when His face was conspicuously displayed on Mount Sinai. The Prophet Habakkuk (<span class="bvs">Hab_3:3</span>) has imitated this figure, though with a different object, viz., that, the people might confidently rely upon his power, which had formerly been manifested to the fathers in visible brightness. </p><p>By “ten thousands of sanctity,” <span class="cite-ref">(306)</span> I do not understand, as many do, the faithful, but the angels, by whom God was accompanied as by a royal retinue; for God also commanded the ark to be placed between the Cherubim, in order to show that the heavenly hosts were around Him. So in Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_6:6</span>,) the Seraphim surround His throne; and Daniel says that he saw “ten thousand times ten thousand,” (<span class="bvs">Dan_7:10</span>;) thus designating an infinite multitude, as does Moses also by “ten thousand.” It is probable that both Paul and Stephen derived from this passage their statement that the Law was “ordained by Angels in the hand of a mediator,” (<span class="bvs">Gal_3:19</span>; <span class="bvs">Act_7:53</span>;) for its authority was greatly confirmed by its having so many witnesses <em>(obsignatores.) </em></p><p>The Law is placed <em>at His right hand, </em>not only as a scepter or mark of dignity, but as His power or rule of government; for He did not merely show Himself as a king, but also made known how He would preside over them. <span class="cite-ref">(307)</span> The Law is called <em>fiery, </em>in order to inspire terror and to enforce humility upon them all; although I am not adverse to the opinion that Moses alludes in this epithet to the outward signs of fire and flame, of which he spoke in <span class="bvs">Exo_20:0</span>. But, since the word <span class="lang he-il">דת</span>, <em>dath, </em>means any statute or edict, some restrict it to the prohibition that none should more closely approach the mountain. In my own mind, however, there is no doubt but that it designates all the doctrine whereby God’s dominion is maintained. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(305)</span><em>Lat., </em>“<em>Went </em>from Sinai.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(306)</span><em>A.
