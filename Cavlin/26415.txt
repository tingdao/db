<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Every man who committeth sin is the slave of sin. </em>This is an argument drawn from contrary things. They boasted that they were free. He proves that they are the <em>slaves of sin, </em>because, being enslaved by the desires of the flesh, they continually sin. It is astonishing that men are not convinced by their own experience, so that, laying aside their pride, they may learn to be humble. And it is a very frequent occurrence in the present day, that, the greater the load of vices by which a man is weighed down, the more fiercely does he utter unmeaning words in extolling free-will. </p><p>Christ appears to say nothing more here than what was formerly said by philosophers, that they who are devoted to their lusts are subject to the most degrading <em>slavery</em>. But there is a deeper and more hidden meaning; for he does not argue what evil men bring on themselves, but what is the condition of human nature. The philosophers thought that any man is a <em>slave </em>by his own choice, and that by the same choice he returns to <em>freedom</em>. But here Christ maintains, that all who are not delivered by him are in a state of <em>slavery</em>, and that all who derive the contagion of sin from corrupted nature are <em>slaves </em>from their birth. We must attend to the comparison between grace and nature, on which Christ here dwells; from which it may be easily seen that men are destitute of freedom, unless they regain it from some other quarter. Yet this <em>slavery </em>is voluntary, so that they who necessarily sin are not compelled to sin. </p></div>
