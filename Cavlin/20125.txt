<div class="comment-content"><p>Now all this has not been expressed without reason, because we know with how many flatteries men are wont to delude themselves when God summons them to judgment; for they immediately look around here and there, and promise themselves impunity, and then they hope for light punishment, as though they were at peace with God. But the unbelieving harden themselves, as Isaiah says, as though they had made a covenant with death and a compact with hell. (<span class="bvs">Isa_28:15</span>.) As, then, the wicked set up security in opposition to God, the Prophet here shews that there are many ways in his hand, by which he can take the fugitives, and those who seem to think that they can escape through their own astuteness; and hence he said, <em>He who flees from terror</em>, that is, from present danger, <em>shall fall into the pit</em>, that is, when the Moabites shall now think themselves secure, they shall meet with new dangers, and new deaths will surround them. </p><p>But we must notice what is added at the end of the verse, <em>Because I will bring on Moab the year of their visitation </em>Here God sustains the minds of the godly, that they might not faint on account of long delay.

We would have God ever to act in haste; and hence, when he exhorts us to patience, all our feelings rebel. This happens, because we do not consider that the fitness of times is determined by his will. Hence he speaks now of <em>the year of visitation</em>, as though he had said, “I may for a time appear to disregard human affairs and to neglect my own, while my people are cruelly oppressed by the wicked; but the time of visitation will come.” For by this word “visitation,” God means that there are changes, or, as they commonly say, revolutions, which are fixed and certain. We now then understand the design of God, when he says, that he would bring a visitation on the Moabites. It follows, — </p></div>
