<div class="comment-content"><p>In the second clause of the fourth verse, he proceeds farther, and states, that he had been a friend, not only to the good, but also to the bad, and had not only restrained himself from all revenge, but had even succoured his enemies, by whom he had been deeply and cruelly injured. It would certainly not be very illustrious virtue to love the good and peaceable, unless there were joined to this self-government and gentleness in patiently bearing with the bad. But when a man not only keeps himself from revenging the injuries which he has received, but endeavours to overcome evil by doing good, he manifests one of the graces of a renewed and sanctified nature, and in this way proves himself to be one of the children of God; for such meekness proceeds only from the Spirit of adoption. With respect to the words: as the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">חלץ</span><em>chalats, </em>which I have translated <em>to delivers </em>signifies <em>to divide </em>and <em>to separate, </em>some, to prevent the necessity of supplying any word to make out the sense, <span class="cite-ref">(103)</span> thus explain the passage, <em>If I have withdrawn myself from my persecutors, in order not to succour them. </em>The other interpretation, however, according to which the verb is rendered <em>to deliver </em>or <em>rescue from </em>danger, is more generally received; because the phrase, <em>to separate </em>or<em>set aside, </em>is applied to those things which we wish to place in safety. And thus the negative word <em>not </em>must be supplied, an omission which we will find not unfrequently occurring in The Psalms. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(103)</span> In the clause, “And have NOT delivered him that persecuted me without cause,” the word <em>not </em>is a supplement, there being nothing for it in the Hebrew text. </p></div></div>
