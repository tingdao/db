<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>For the horse of Pharaoh went in. </em>This verse does not; seem to be suited to the song, and therefore I am rather of opinion that Moses returns here to the history, and assigns the reason why the Israelites so magnificently celebrated the praises of God. For the sake of avoiding ambiguity, it would perhaps be better thus to render it, — “For the horse of Pharaoh had gone in, and the Lord had brought again the waters of the sea upon them, but; the children of Israel had gone on dry land.” <span class="cite-ref">(168)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(168)</span> There is the following addition in the <em>Fr</em>. : — ‘Voyla pourquoy j’ai mis les verbes en temps plus que parfait;” you see why I have put the words in the pluperfect tense. </p></div></div>
