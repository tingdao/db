<div class="comment-content"><p>From this passage, as well as other similar ones, it plainly appears how many vices were of necessity tolerated in this people. It was altogether an act of barbarism that fathers should sell their children for the relief of their poverty, still it could not be corrected as might have been hoped. Again, the sanctity of the marriage-vow should have been greater than that it should be allowable for a master to repudiate his bond-maid, after he had betrothed her to himself as his wife; or, when he had betrothed her to his son, to make void that covenant, which is inviolable: for that principle ought ever to hold good — “Those whom God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” ( <span class="bvs">Mat_19:6</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_10:9</span>.) Yet liberty was accorded to the ancient people in all these particulars; only provision is here made that the poor girls should not suffer infamy and injury from their repudiation. But, although God is gracious in remitting the punishment, still He shows that chastity is pleasing to Him, as far as the people’s hardness of heart permitted. First of all, He does not allow a master to seduce his purchased maid-servant, but if he wishes to enjoy her embraces, a marriage must take place; for although He does not set this out in express terms, still we may infer from what He condemns, that the contrary is what He approves. From whence, too, their notion is refuted who suppose that fornication was lawful under the Law. But the words must be more closely examined on account of their ambiguity. First, the sex is treated with consideration, that the condition of a female may be somewhat more favorable than that of a male; since, otherwise, their weakness would render young women subject to injury and shame. An explanation then follows, respecting which, however, interpreters differ; for some read the particle <span class="lang he-il">לא</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(74)</span><em>lo</em>, which is properly negative, for <span class="lang he-il">לו</span>, <em>lo</em>; and hence arise two opposite meanings — If he hath, or hath <em>not</em>, betrothed her to himself. If it be preferred to take it affirmatively, the meaning of the precept will be: If a master shall repudiate his bond-maid, whom he has loved and destined to be his wife, he must give her her liberty; for although literally it is, “he shall cause her to be redeemed,” yet; the context shows that the obligation of setting her free is laid upon him; nor is this contradicted by the fact that he is only deprived of the power of selling her to a strange people; since I do not understand this as applying to foreigners only, but to others of his own nation, since sometimes those of another tribe or family are called strangers. For, even though there were no marriage-compact, it was not otherwise lawful to sell slaves of the holy and elect people to foreigners. Besides, amongst the Israelites, slavery was only temporary. But, to pass by everything else, let it suffice to observe the absurdity that a master should hold his wife as a slave to be sold at pleasure, if their opinion is received who suppose that the words refer to repudiation after betrothal. <span class="cite-ref">(75)</span> I myself rather approve of the other opinion, that, although the master shall not have aspired to matrimony with her, if her appearance displeases him so that he would be unwilling to have her as his wife, at least he must provide for her redemption; because her chastity would be in jeopardy if she remained with him unmarried; unless perhaps Moses may signify that, after she had been seduced, her master did not honor her with marriage. But the other view which I have just expressed is more simple; and a caution is given lest masters should seduce their maid-servants at their pleasure. Thus the word <em>despise </em><span class="cite-ref">(76)</span> does not refer to repudiation, but is opposed to beauty, or conjugal love. </p><p>The next case is, that if he should betroth her to his son, (he must give her a dowry, <span class="cite-ref">(77)</span>) in which, also, her modesty and honor is consulted, lest she should be oppressed by the right of ownership, and become a harlot. In the third place, it is provided that, if she should be repudiated, her condition should not be disadvantageous. If, therefore, he would make her his daughter-in-law, and betroth her to his son, he is commanded to deal liberally with her; for “after the manner of daughters” is equivalent to giving her a dowry, or, at any rate, to treating her as if she were free. Finally, he adds that, if he should choose another wife for his son, he should not reject the former one, nor defraud her of her food and raiment, or of some third thing, concerning which translators are not well agreed. Some render it <em>time</em>, but I do not see what is the meaning of <em>diminishing her time</em>; others, <em>duty of marriage</em>, but this is too free a translation; others, more correctly, <em>affliction</em>, since the girl would be humiliated by her repudiation; still, to diminish affliction, is too harsh an expression for to compensate an injury. Let my readers, then, consider whether the word, <span class="lang he-il">ענתה</span>, <em>gnonathah</em>, is not used for <em>compact </em>or <em>agreement</em>; for thus the context will run very well: If his son have married another wife, that the girl who has suffered ignominious rejection should obtain her rights as to food, and raiment, and her appointed dowry; otherwise, God commands that she should be set free gratuitously, in order that her liberty may compensate for the wrong she has received. </p><p><strong>(74)</strong> The Hebrew text has <span class="lang he-il">לא</span>, <em>not</em>, but with a mark of doubt as to the genuineness of the reading, and the Masoretic note directs the substitution of <span class="lang he-il">לו</span>, <em>to him C</em>. follows <em>S. M</em>. in adhering to the text, whilst our <em>A. V. </em>and the <em>LXX</em>. reject <em>not</em>, in accordance with the Masora. — <em>W </em></p><p><strong>(75)</strong> This sentence is omitted in Ft., and the following substituted: “Ce mot doncques ou il est dit, <em>Qu </em>’<em>il ne la pourra vendre a des estrangers</em>, est entrelasse, pour monstrer, qu’il n’y eust eu nulle raison qu’il vendist celle qu’il a abusee de vaine esperance;“ this sentence, then, in which it is said that he may not sell her to strangers, is inserted to show that there was no reason why he should sell her whom he has abused with vain hopes. </p><p><strong>(76)</strong><em>A. V</em>. , “If she please not.” Margin, “<em>Heb</em>. , Be evil in the eyes of, etc.” </p><p><strong>(77)</strong> Added from <em>Fr</em>. , in which there is much verbal difference here. </p></div>
