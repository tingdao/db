<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_13:53</span><strong>.</strong><em>When Jesus had concluded. Matthew </em>does not mean, that immediately after delivering these discourses, he came into his own country; for it is evident from <em>Mark, </em>that some interval of time elapsed. But the meaning is, that after having taught for some time in Judea, he returned again to the Galileans, but did not receive from them kind treatment. A narrative which Luke gives (<span class="bvs">Luk_4:22</span>) is nearly similar, but is not the same. Nor ought we to wonder that Christ’s countrymen, when they perceived that his family was mean and despised, and that he had been poorly educated, were at first so much offended as to murmur at his doctrine, and afterwards persevered in the same malice to such an extent, that they did not cease to slander him, when he chose to discharge the office of a prophet amongst them. This second rejection of Christ shows that the space of time which had intervened had not effected a reformation on the inhabitants of Nazareth, but that the same contempt was constantly thrown as an obstacle in the way, to prevent them from hearing Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(345)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(345)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A fin de n’approcher de luy, et de ne recevoir sa doctrine</span>;” — “that they might not approach to him, and might not receive his doctrine.” </p></div></div>
