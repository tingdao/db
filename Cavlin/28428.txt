<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>Let no man deceive himself </em>Here he puts his finger upon the true sore, as the whole mischief originated in this — that they were wise in their own conceit. Hence he exhorts them not to deceive themselves with a false impression, by arrogating any wisdom to themselves — by which he means, that all are under a mistake, who depend upon their own judgment. Now, he addresses himself, in my opinion, to hearers as well as teachers. For the former discovered a partiality for those ambitious men, and lent an ear to them, <span class="cite-ref">(192)</span> because they had too fastidious a taste, so that the simplicity of the gospel was insipid to their taste; while the latter aimed at nothing but show, that they might be in some estimation. He accordingly admonishes both to this effect — “Let no one rest satisfied with his own wisdom, but let him <em>who thinketh himself to be wise, become a fool in this world</em>, ” or, “<em>Let </em>him who is distinguished in this world by reputation for wisdom, of his own accord empty himself, <span class="cite-ref">(193)</span> and <em>become a fool </em>in his own estimation.” </p><p>Farther, in these words the Apostle does not require, that we should altogether renounce the wisdom that is implanted in us by nature, or acquired by long practice; but simply, that we subject it to the service of God, so as to have no wisdom but through his word. For this is what is meant by <em>becoming a fool in this world</em>, or in our own estimation — when we are prepared to give way to God, and embrace with fear and reverence everything that he teaches us, rather than follow what may appear to us plausible. <span class="cite-ref">(194)</span></p><p>The meaning of the clause <em>in this world</em>, is as though he had said — “According to the judgment or opinion of the world.” For the wisdom of the world is this — if we reckon ourselves sufficient of ourselves for <em>taking counsel </em>as to all matters (<span class="bvs">Psa_13:2</span>) for governing ourselves, and for managing whatever we have to do — if we have no dependence on any other <span class="cite-ref">(195)</span> — if we feel no need of the guidance of another, but are <em>competent </em>to govern ourselves. <span class="cite-ref">(196)</span> He, therefore, on, the other hand, is <em>a fool in this world</em>, who, renouncing his own understanding, allows himself to be directed by the Lord, as if with his eyes shut — who, distrusting himself, leans wholly upon the Lord, places his whole wisdom in him, and yields himself up to God in docility and submission. It is necessary that our wisdom should in this way vanish, in order that the will of God may have authority over us, and that we be emptied of our own understanding, that we may be filled with the wisdom of God. At the same time, the clause <span class="cite-ref">(197)</span> may either be taken in connection with the first part of the verse, or joined with the last, but as the meaning is not much different, I leave every one to choose for himself. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(192)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Trop facilement</span>;” — “Too readily.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(193)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Soit fait fol en soy de son bon gre s’abbaissant, et s’aneantissant soymesme</span>;” — “Let him become, of his own accord, a fool in his own estimation, abasing and emptying himself.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(194)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Bon et raisonnable</span>;” — “Good and reasonable.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(195)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que de nous-mesmes</span>;” — “Than ourselves.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(196)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nous semble que nous sommes assez suffisans de nous conduire, et gouuerner nous-mesmes</span>;” — “It appears to us, that we are quite competent to conduct and govern ourselves.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(197)</span> “<em class="lang fr-fr">En ce monde </em>;” — “<em>In this world</em>. ” </p></div></div>
