<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27</strong><em>You are like whitened sepulchers. </em>This is a different metaphor, but the meaning is the same; for he compares them to <em>sepulchers, </em>which the men of the world ambitiously construct with great beauty and splendor. As a painting or engraving on <em>sepulchers </em>draws the eyes of men upon them, while inwardly they contain stinking carcasses; so Christ says that hypocrites deceive by their outward appearance, because they are full of deceit and iniquity. The words of Luke are somewhat different, that they deceive the eyes of men, <em>like sepulchers, which frequently are not perceived by those who walk over them; </em>but it amounts to the same meaning, that, under the garb of pretended holiness, there lurks hidden filth which they cherish in their hearts, like a marble <em>sepulcher; </em>for it wears the aspect of what is beautiful and lovely, but covers a stinking carcass, so as not to be offensive to those who pass by. Hence we infer what I have formerly said, that Christ, with a view to the advantage of the simple and ignorant, tore off the deceitful mask which the scribes held wrapped around them in empty hypocrisy; for this warning was advantageous to simple persons, that they might quickly withdraw from the jaws of wolves. Yet this passage contains a general doctrine, that the children of God ought to desire to be pure rather than to appear so. </p></div>
