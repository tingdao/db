<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_5:10</span><strong>.</strong><em>For afterwards thou shalt catch men. </em>The words of Matthew are, <em>I will make you fishers of men; </em>and those of Mark are, <em>I will cause that you may become fishers of men. </em>They teach us, that Peter, and the other three, were not only gathered by Christ to be his disciples, but were made apostles, or, at least, chosen with a view to the apostleship. It is, therefore, not merely a general call to faith, but a special call to a particular office, that is here described. The duties of instruction, I do admit, are not yet enjoined upon them; but still it is to prepare them for being instructors, <span class="cite-ref">(340)</span> that Christ receives and admits them into his family. This ought to be carefully weighed; for all are not commanded to leave their parents and their former occupation, and literally <span class="cite-ref">(341)</span> to follow Christ. There are some whom the Lord is satisfied with having in his flock and his Church, while he assigns to others their own station. Those who have received from him a public office ought to know, that something more is required from them than from private individuals. In the case of others, our Lord makes no change as to the ordinary way of life; but he withdraws those four disciples from the employment from which they had hitherto derived their subsistence, that he may employ their labors in a nobler office. </p><p>Christ selected rough mechanics, — persons not only destitute of learning, but inferior in capacity, that he might train, or rather renew them by the power of his Spirit, so as to excel all the wise men of the world. He intended to humble, in this manner, the pride of the flesh, and to present, in their persons, a remarkable instance of spiritual grace, that we may learn to implore from heaven the light of faith, when we know that it cannot be acquired by our own exertions. Again, though he chose unlearned and ignorant persons, he did not leave them in that condition; and, therefore, what he did ought not to be held by us to be an example, as if we were now to ordain pastors, who were afterwards to be trained to the discharge of their office. We know the rule which he prescribes for us, by the mouth of Paul that none ought to be called to it, unless they are <em>“ </em>apt to teach,” (<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:2</span>.) When our Lord chose persons of this description it was not because he preferred ignorance to learning as some fanatics do, who are delighted with their own ignorance, and fancy that, in proportion as they hate literature, they approach the nearer to the apostles. He resolved at first, no doubt, to choose contemptible persons, in order to humble the pride of those who think that heaven is not open to the unlearned; but he afterwards gave to those fishers, as an associate in their office, Paul, who had been carefully educated from his childhood. </p><p>As to the meaning of the metaphor, <em>fishers of men, </em>there is no necessity for a minute investigation. Yet, as it was drawn from the present occurrence, the allusion which Christ made to <em>fishing, </em>when he spoke of the preaching of the Gospel, was appropriate: for men stray and wander in the world, as in a great and troubled sea, till they are gathered by the Gospel. The history related by the Evangelist John (<span class="bvs">Joh_1:37</span>) differs from this: for Andrew, who had been one of John’s disciples, was handed over by him to Christ, and afterwards brought his brother along with him. At that time, they embraced him as their master, but were afterwards elevated to a higher rank. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(340)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il les prend en sa compagnie et conversation domestique, afin de les faconner a enseigner puis apres les autres</span>.” — “He takes them into his society and private conversation, in order to prepare them afterwards to instruct others.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(341)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour suivre Christ des pieds, c'est a dire exterieurement</span>;” — “to follow Christ with the feet, that is to <em>say, </em>externally.” </p></div></div>
