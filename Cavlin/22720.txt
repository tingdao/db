<div class="comment-content"><p>When he says, <span class="lang he-il">כל-ראיך</span>, <em>cal-raik</em>, ‘whosoever sees thee,’ we hence learn again that <span class="lang he-il">רואי</span>, <em>ruai, </em>at the end of the last verse, is to be taken for example or spectacle; for the Prophet proceeds with the same subject: <em>I will make thee, </em>he says,<em>an example, </em>or a spectacle. — For what purpose? <em>that whosoever sees thee may depart from thee </em><span class="cite-ref">(242)</span> And it was an evidence of horror, though some think it to have been a reward for her cruelty, that no one came to Nineveh, but that she was forsaken by all friends in her desolation. And they take in the same sense what follows, <em>Who will condole with her? and whence shall I seek comforters for thee? </em>For they think that the Ninevites are here reproached for their cruelty, because they made themselves so hated by all that they were unworthy of sympathy; for they spared none, they allowed themselves full liberty in injuring others, they had gained the hatred of all the world. Hence some think that what is here intimated is, that the Ninevites were justly detested by and so that no one condoled with them in so great a calamity, inasmuch as they had been injurious to all: “It shall then happen, that whosoever sees thee shall go far away from thee and shall say, Wasted is Nineveh; who will condole with her? Whence shall I call comforters to her?” </p><p>But I know not whether this refined meaning came into the Prophet’s mind. We may explain the words more simply, that all would flee far away as a proof of their horrors and that the calamity would be such, that no lamentation would correspond with it. Who will be able to console with her? that is, were the greatness of her calamity duly weighed, though all were to weep and utter their meanings, it would not yet be sufficient: all lamentations would be far unequal to so great a calamity. The Prophet seems rather to mean this. <em>Who </em>then <em>shall condole with her? </em>and whence shall I seek comforters, as though he said, “The ruin of so splendid a city will not be of an ordinary kind, but what cannot be equaled by any lamentations.” It then follows — </p><p><strong>(242)</strong> Literally, “Every one of thy seers shall hasten from thee.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
