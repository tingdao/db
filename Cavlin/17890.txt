<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And righteousness shall be the belt. </em><span class="cite-ref">(185)</span> Some translate it <em>girdle</em>; but as the Prophet represents Christ to us wearing, as it were, the emblems of royalty, I have rather translated it <em>belt</em>, which is also a royal emblem, in the same manner as the scepter, which he had assigned to him a little before. When Job speaks of taking away the authority of kings, he says that the Lord will ungird their <em>belt</em>. (<span class="bvs">Job_12:18</span>.) To be <em>girded </em>with a <em>belt</em>, therefore, is nothing else than to be exalted to royal authority, as we shall afterwards see in another passage. (<span class="bvs">Isa_14:5</span>.) </p><p>The Prophet describes two ornaments belonging to the <em>belt</em>. These are <em>righteousness </em>and <em>truth</em>; unless it be thought that there is a change in the order of construction, as if he had said that Christ will be girded <em>with true righteousness</em>; for <em>truth </em>is not added as if it were different from <em>righteousness</em>, but in order to point out the nature of that <em>righteousness </em>with which Christ is <em>girded</em>. Some think that <em>righteousness </em>here denotes that which Christ imparts to us, that it may dwell, not only in himself, but in his members. <em>Faith </em>or <em>truth </em>they understand to be that by which we embrace the salvation which he offers to us. </p><p>The Chaldee paraphrast explains it thus; “and the righteous shall be round about him, believing worshippers shall approach to him.” <span class="cite-ref">(186)</span> But I adopt a more simple interpretation, as if he had said, “He shall not appear like kings, clothed with purple and a crown, or girded with a <em>belt</em>; but <em>righteousness </em>and <em>truth </em>shall shine forth in him.” I acknowledge, indeed, that <em>righteousness </em>is not confined to Christ, but belongs to his members; but we must attend to the mode of expression, that Christ comes forth to govern his people <em>girded with righteousness</em>, which he afterwards imparts to them by the secret influence of the Spirit. If we distinguish between the word <span class="lang he-il">אמונה</span> (<em>emunah</em>) and <em>righteousness</em>, I consider it to mean <em>faithfulness </em>or <em>steadfastness</em>; as if he had said that Christ never disappoints his followers, for he continues always to be like himself. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(185)</span><em>The girdle</em>. — Eng.
