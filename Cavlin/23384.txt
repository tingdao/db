<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And when Jesus saw their thoughts </em>He now gives a proof of his Divinity in bringing to light their secret thoughts: <em>for who knoweth the things of a man but the spirit of man which is in him? </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_2:11</span>.) And so Mark adds, that <em>Jesus knew by his Spirit: </em>which means, that what was concealed in their hearts could not be perceived by man, but that Christ by his Divine Spirit knew it thoroughly. <em>Why do you think evil? </em>This does not imply that it gave them pain to see a mortal man assuming what God claims as his own prerogative, but that they proudly and wickedly rejected God, who was openly manifested to them. </p></div>
