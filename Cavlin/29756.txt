<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>This is a faithful saying </em>He now sets down, at the conclusion of the argument, what he stated twice at the beginning of it; and he appears to do so expressly, because he will immediately subjoin the contrary objection. Yet it is not without good reason that he employs so strong an assertion; for it is a paradox strongly at variance with the feeling of the flesh, that God supplies his people, in this world, with everything that is necessary for a happy and joyful life; since they are often destitute of all good things, and, on that account, appear to be forsaken by God. Accordingly, not satisfied with the simple doctrine, he wards off all opposing temptations by this shield, and in this manner instructs believers to open the door to the grace of God, which our unbelief shuts out; for, undoubtedly if we were willing to receive God’s benefits, <span class="cite-ref">(75)</span> he would use greater liberality toward us. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(75)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si les benefices de Dieu trouvoyent entree a nous, et que nous fussion disposez a les recevoir</span>.” — “If God’s benefits found admission to us, and if we were disposed to receive them.” </p></div></div>
