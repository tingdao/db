<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet, as it has been before stated, does not mourn the calamity of the people of Moab, but assumes the character of others, so that the event might appear more evident, it being set as it were before our eyes; for as we have said, the wealth of the Moabites was so great at that time, that it dazzled the eyes of all. It was then difficult for the faithful to form an idea of this vengeance of God, therefore the Prophet transfers to himself the feelings of others, and relates what the Moabites would do, when God had so grievously afflicted them. </p><p><em>My heart</em>, he says, <em>shall sound like pipes </em>Some think that mournful pipes are meant, but I know not whether or not they were instruments of this kind; and there are those who think that <span class="lang he-il">חללים</span>, <em>chellim</em>, were bag-pipes, but what is too refined I leave. The Prophet simply means that such would be the trepidation, that the hearts of the Moabites would make a noise like pipes. He repeats the same thing in different words, that his <em>heart </em>would <em>make a noise, </em>or sound, <em>for the men of Kir-heres</em>, of which city we spoke yesterday. </p><p>He now adds, <em>for the residue which they have made</em>, or which Moab has made, for the verb is in the singular number; and then, <em>they have perished, </em>where also there is a change of number; but the reference is to the word “residue,” <span class="lang he-il">יתרת</span>,<em>iteret</em>, which included hidden treasures, as we have stated. <span class="cite-ref">(20)</span> Whatever then the Moabites had gained for themselves, and whatever they thought would be always safe, the Prophet declares that it would perish. Isaiah adds, “their substance,” <span class="lang he-il">פקותם</span>, <em>pekotem</em>, and says, that they would carry it to the willows, that is, to deserted places; as though he had said, that all the wealth of the Moabites would be scattered, as though it were, as they say, a thing forsaken. It now follows — </p><p><strong>(20)</strong> As to this clause, widely different are all the versions; the <em>Targ. </em>gives the general sense. The word <span class="lang he-il">יתרת</span> is evidently plural, the <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> being wanting. “Reserves,” as given by <em>Blayney, </em>is an exact rendering, — </p><p>Because the reserves he had made have perished. </p><p>Connected with this word is another in <span class="bvs">Isa_15:7</span>, which means “deposits;” both signify the wealth or treasures they had laid up. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
