<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah uses nearly the same words; but the sense of the expression is ambiguous, when he says, ‘Lo, little have I set thee.’ To me it appears probable, that the Prophet reproves the Idumeans, because they became arrogant, as it were, against the will of God, and in opposition to it, when, at the same time, they were confined to the narrow passes of mountains. It is said elsewhere, (<span class="bvs">Mal_1:2</span>,) ‘Jacob and Esau, were they not brethren?’ “But I have given to you the inheritance promised to your father Abraham; I have transferred the Idumeans to mount Seir.” Now it is less bearable, if any one be elated with pride, when his condition is not so honorable. I therefore think that the Idumeans are here condemned because they vaunted so much, and arrogated to themselves more than what was right, when they yet were contemptible, when their condition was mean and obscure, for they dwelt on mount Seir. But others think that the punishment, which was impending over them, is here denounced, <em>Lo, little have I made thee among the nations, </em>and Jeremiah says, <em>‘and contemptible among men’; </em>he omits the two words, thou and exceedingly; he says only, <em>‘and contemptible among men’. </em>But as to the substance, there is hardly any difference. If then we understand that that nation was proud without reason, the sense is evident, that is, that they, like the giants, carried on war against God, that they vaunted themselves, though confined to the narrow passes of mountains. Though I leave to others their own free opinion, I am yet inclined to the former view, while the latter has been adopted nearly by the consent of all; and that is, that God was resolved forcibly to constrain to order those ferocious men, who, for no reason, and even in opposition to nature, are become insolent. But if a different interpretation be more approved, we may say, that the Prophet begins with a threatening, and then subjoins a reason why God determined to diminish and even to destroy them: for though they dwelt on mountains, it was yet a fertile region; and further, they had gathered in course of long time much wealth, when they attained security, when no enemy disturbed them. This then is the reasoning, <em>Lo, I have made thee small and contemptible in the mountain, </em>— and why? <em>because the pride of thy heart has deceived thee; </em>and Jeremiah adds, terror, <span class="cite-ref">(71)</span> although some render <span class="lang he-il">תפלצתך</span><em>taphlatastae</em>, image; but this seems not appropriate. Jeremiah then, I doubt not, mentions terror in the first place; for it almost ever happens, that the proud strike others with fear: such then were the Idumeans. </p><p>Now if we follow the first meaning I explained, the two verses may be read as connected<em>, Lo, I have made thee small and contemptible among the nations; </em><span class="cite-ref">(72)</span><em>but the pride of thy heart has deceived thee; </em>some render it, has raised thee up, deriving it from <span class="lang he-il">נשא</span><em>nusha</em>: but they read <span class="lang he-il">ש</span><em>shin</em>, pointed on the left side; for if <span class="lang he-il">נשא</span><em>nusha </em>has the point in the branch of the shin, on the right hand, it means to deceive, but if on the left, it signifies to raise up. Then they give this translations “The pride of thine heart has raised thee up:” but we clearly learn from Jeremiah, that it ought, as almost all interpreters agree, to be rendered thus, “The pride of thine heart has deceived thee:” for he says not <span class="lang he-il">השיאך</span><em>eshiac </em>but <span class="lang he-il">השיא אותך</span><em>eshia autea</em>, that is, it was to thee the cause of error and of madness. Of the sense then of this verb there can be no doubt. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(71)</span><em>Blayney</em>, for very satisfactory reasons, transfers this word to the preceding verse, and then the passage will be almost literally the same with this of Obadiah. The 15<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, and the beginning of the 16<span class="cite-ref">th</span> in Jeremiah <span class="bvs">Jer_49:15</span> may be thus rendered, — </p><p>15. For, behold, small have I made thee among the nations, <LineBreak />Contemptible among the men of thy terror, <LineBreak />(that is, such as thou didst fear.) </p><p>16. Deceived thee has the pride of thy heart; etc. </p><p>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(72)</span> It is evidently of the past, and not of the future, that this verse speaks. The corresponding passage in Jeremiah is, in our version, rendered in the future tense, but <em>Blayney </em>renders it, as it is, in the past tense. Our version here adopts the past tense in the first line, “I have made,” etc., and the present in the second, “Thou <em>art, </em>” etc., contrary to the rule, that when the auxiliary verb is not expressed in the original, the tense of the verbs expressed is to be observed. The two lines should therefore be thus translated, — </p><p><em>Behold, small have I made thee among the nations; </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Despised </em>wert <em>thou exceedingly. </em></p><p>The reference is, no doubt, as Calvin says, to the poor inheritance assigned to the Edomites, and to the low station they occupied among other nations; and hence their pride and insolence appeared more evident and unreasonable. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
