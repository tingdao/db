<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong>]<em>I will call them my people which are not a people </em>This is said with respect to the divorce, which God had already made with the people, by depriving them of all honor, so that they did not excel other nations. Though they indeed, whom God in his eternal counsel has destined as sons to himself, are perpetually his sons, yet Scripture in many parts counts none to be God’s children but those the election of whom has been proved by their calling: and hence he teaches us not to judge, much less to decide, respecting God’s election, except as far as it manifests itself by its own evidences. Thus Paul, after having shown to the Ephesians that their election and adoption had been determined by God before the creation of the world, shortly after declares, that they were once alienated from God, (<span class="bvs">Eph_2:12</span>,) that is, during that time when the Lord had not manifested his love towards them; though he had embraced them in his eternal mercy. Hence, in this passage, they are said not to be beloved, to whom God declares wrath rather than love: for until adoption reconciles men to God, we know that his wrath abides on them. </p><p>The feminine gender of the participle depends on the context of the prophet; for he had said, that a daughter had been born to him, to whom he gave this name,<em>Not beloved, </em>in order that the people might know that they were hated by God. Now as rejection was the reason for hatred, so the beginning of love, as the prophet teaches, is, when God adopts those who had been for a time strangers. <span class="cite-ref">(311)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(311)</span> The quotation is from <span class="bvs">Hos_2:23</span>, and is not literal either from the Hebrew or from the <em>Septuagint. </em>The order of the verse is reversed; and the word “beloved” is taken from the <em>Septuagint. </em>“Not beloved,” in Hebrew, is <em>lo-ruhamah, i.e., </em>one not pitied, or one who has not received mercy: which is the same in meaning. </p><p>In <span class="bvs">Rom_9:26</span>, the words are taken from <span class="bvs">Hos_1:10</span> and are not <em>verbatim </em>either from the Hebrew or the <em>Septuagint, </em>but the difference is very trifling. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
