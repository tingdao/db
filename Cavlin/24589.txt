<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_9:50</span><strong>.</strong><em>Have salt in yourselves </em>This word may be taken in a different sense from what it had in the former verse, as meaning that seasoning of good odor, which is obtained by faith, or rather the wisdom of the Spirit. When Paul enjoins, “Let your speech be always with grace, <em>seasoned with salt,” </em>(<span class="bvs">Col_4:6</span>,) he means, that we ought to be holy, and purified from all profane follies and corruptions, and filled with spiritual grace, which edifies all who hear it, and diffuses over them its sweet odor. If this exposition is adopted, it may be necessary to understand the latter clause as referring to the mutual peace, which is promoted by that salt. Yet, as it is more probable, that this last sentence depends on the former discourse, I think that Christ is exhorting his own people to maintain the rigor of faith, which may serve also to purify others. “You must do your endeavor, not only to be <em>salted within, </em>but likewise to <em>salt </em>others.” But as salt bites by its sharpness, he immediately admonishes them to regulate the seasoning in such a manner, that <em>peace </em>may be preserved entire <em>with one another </em></p></div>
