Still God would have them, as soon as they were in enjoyment of the land, come together even from their remotest boundaries to the sanctuary. He omits certain kinds of offerings of which he had lately spoken, and puts, instead of “vows<em>, </em>” <span class="cite-ref">(109)</span> “the choice vows,” which some translate “very choice vows,” or “the chief things in your vows.” I do not reject this; but the other sense is more simple, that all the vows were comprised which every one had made of his own free judgment and choice. Soon afterwards he more fully expresses his meaning, when he prohibits them from offering sacrifices of their own accord in any places that might please them; for, “to see a place<em>, </em>” here, is equivalent to being carried away by the sight, so as to connect religion and holiness with elegance and beauty. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(109)</span><em>A.V</em>. , Your choice vows; <em>margin, </em>the choice of your vows.
