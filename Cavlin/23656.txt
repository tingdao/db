<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_15:22</span><strong>.</strong><em>Have compassion on me, O Lord. </em>Though this woman was an alien, and did not belong to the Lord’s flock, yet she had acquired some taste of piety; <span class="cite-ref">(416)</span> for, without some knowledge of the promises, she would not have called Christ the <em>Son of David. </em>The Jews indeed had almost entirely departed, or at least had greatly turned aside, from the pure and sound doctrine of the Gospel; but a report of the promised redemption was extensively prevalent. As the restoration of the Church depended on the reign of David, whenever they spoke of the Messiah, it was customary for them to employ the name, <em>Son of David; </em>and indeed this confession was heard from the lips of all. But when the true faith had died out amongst them, it was an amazing and incredible display of the goodness of God that the sweet savor of the promises reached the neighboring nations. Though this woman had not been regularly educated by any teacher, yet her faith in Christ was not a notion adopted by her at random, but was formed out of the law and the prophets. It was therefore not less absurd than wicked in that dog, Servetus, to abuse this example for the purpose of proving that faith may exist without promises. I do not deny that, in this sense, there may sometimes be a sort of implicit faith, that is, a faith which is not accompanied by a full and distinct knowledge of sound doctrine; provided we also hold that faith always springs from the word of God, and takes its origin from true principles, and therefore is always found in connection with some light of knowledge. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(416)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quelque goust de piete et vraye religion</span>;” — “some taste of piety and true religion.” </p></div></div>
