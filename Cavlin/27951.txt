<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>For when they knew God</em>, <em>etc. </em>He plainly testifies here, that God has presented to the minds of all the means of knowing him, having so manifested himself by his works, that they must necessarily see what of themselves they seek not to know — that there is some God; for the world does not by chance exist, nor could it have proceeded from itself. But we must ever bear in mind the degree of knowledge in which they continued; and this appears from what follows. </p><p><em>They glorified him not as God</em>. No idea can be formed of God without including his eternity, power, wisdom, goodness, truth, righteousness, and mercy. His eternity appears evident, because he is the maker of all things — his power, because he holds all things in his hand and continues their existence — his wisdom, because he has arranged things in such an exquisite order — his goodness, for there is no other cause than himself, why he created all things, and no other reason, why he should be induced to preserve them — his justice, because in his government he punishes the guilty and defends the innocent — his mercy, because he bears with so much forbearance the perversity of men — and his truth, because he is unchangeable. He then who has a right notion of God ought to give him the praise due to his eternity, wisdom, goodness, and justice. Since men have not recognized these attributes in God, but have dreamt of him as though he were an empty phantom, they are justly said to have impiously robbed him of his own glory. Nor is it without reason that he adds, <em>that they were not thankful</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(48)</span> for there is no one who is not indebted to him for numberless benefits: yea, even on this account alone, because he has been pleased to reveal himself to us, he has abundantly made us indebted to him. <em>But they became vain</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(49)</span><em>etc.</em>; that is, having forsaken the truth of God, they turned to the vanity of their own reason, all the acuteness of which is fading and passes away like vapor. And thus their foolish mind, being involved in darkness, could understand nothing aright but was carried away headlong, in various ways, into errors and delusions. Their unrighteousness was this — they quickly choked by their own depravity the seed of right knowledge, before it grew up to ripeness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(48)</span> The conjunctive<span class="lang el-gr">, ἤ, </span> is for ουτε, says [<span class="bvs">Piscator </span>] <em>: </em>but it is a Hebraism, for <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> is sometimes used in Hebrew without the negative, which belongs to a former clause. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(49)</span> The original words are<span class="lang el-gr">, ἐματαιώθησαν ἐν τοῖς διαλογισμοῖς αὐτῶν, </span> “Vani facti sunt in ratiocinationibus suis — they became vain in their reasonings” [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>], [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Turrettin </span>] <em>, and </em>[<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] <em>; </em>“They became foolish by their own reasonings,” [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] </p><p>“Whatever the right reason within,” says [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>], “or the frame of the world without, might have suggested respecting God, they indulged in pleasing speculations, specious reasonings, and in subtle and frivolous conclusions; some denied the existence of a God, as Epicurus and Democritus — others doubted, as Protagoras and Diagoras — others affirmed the existence of many gods, and these, as the Platonics, maintained that they are not corporeal, while the Greeks and Romans held them to be so, who worshipped dead men, impious, cruel, impure, and wicked. There were also the Egyptians, who worshipped as gods, brute animals, oxen, geese, birds, crocodiles, yea, what grew in their gardens, garlic’s and onions. A very few, such as Plato and Aristotle, acknowledged one Supreme Being; but even these deprived him of his providence. These, and the like, were the monstrous opinions which the Gentiles deduced from their reasonings. They became <em>vain</em>, foolish, senseless.” </p><p>“And darkened became their foolish heart<span class="lang el-gr">,” — ἡ ἀσύνετος αὐτῶν καρδία; </span> “Corinthians eorum intelligentia carens — their heart void of understanding;” “their unintelligent heart,” [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>]. Perhaps “undiscerning heart” would be the most suitable. See <span class="bvs">Mat_15:16</span>. Heart, after the manner of the Hebrews, is to be taken here for the whole soul, especially the mind. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
