<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Take the shield. </em>These words certainly cannot be applied, in the strict and proper sense, to God, who has no need of the spear or buckler: for by the breath of his mouth alone, or merely with his nod, he is able to overthrow all his enemies. But although such figures at first sight appear rude, yet the Holy Ghost employs them in accommodation to the weakness of our understanding, for the purpose of impressing more effectually upon our minds the conviction that God is present to aid us. When troubles and dangers arise, when terrors assail us on every side, when even death presents itself to our view, it is difficult to realize the secret and invisible power of God, which is able to deliver us from all anxiety and fear; for our understandings, which are gross and earthly, tend downward to the earth. That our faith, therefore, may ascend by degrees to the heavenly power of God, he is here introduced armed, after the manner of men, with sword and shield. In the same way, also, when he is in another place termed “a man of war,” it is doubtless in adaptation to the imperfection of our present state, because our minds, from their limited capacity, could in no other way comprehend the extent of that infinite power, which contains in itself every form of help, and has no need of aid from any other quarter. This, therefore, is a prayer that God, by the exercise of his secret and intrinsic power, would show that he alone is able to encounter the whole strength and forces of the ungodly. Some suppose that the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">צנה</span>, <em>tsinnah, </em>here used, means <em>a dart, </em>or some other kind of weapon; but as we have already seen, in the fifth psalm, that it properly signifies a <em>buckler, </em>I see no reason why it should be differently interpreted in this place. Nor is there any thing at all inconsistent in connecting here, as is often done in other places, the buckler and the shield. <span class="cite-ref">(702)</span> If the expression here employed had been designed to signify a dart, or a similar weapon, it would have been more natural to connect it with the spear, of which mention is made in the following verse. David, then, first makes mention of defensive armor, praying that God would sustain and repel the assaults of the enemy. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">ריק</span><em>, rik, </em>which signifies <em>to unsheath, </em>or <em>make bare, </em>I take simply to mean, <em>to draw out, </em>or <em>bring forth. </em>The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">סגור</span>, <em>segor, </em>which I have translated <em>to oppose, </em>literally signifies <em>to shut </em>or <em>to close. </em>But as David’s meaning is, that God, by setting himself as a wall or rampart, would prevent his enemies from approaching him, it appears to me that I have faithfully translated it. At the same time, if any should prefer the translation to <em>shut, </em>or <em>close the way, </em>or <em>to impede it by some obstacle, </em>the meaning; is substantially the same. The opinion of those who contend that it is a noun, <span class="cite-ref">(703)</span> is not at all probable. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(702)</span> The word rendered <em>shield </em>is in the Hebrew text <span class="lang he-il">מגך</span>, <em>magen, </em>which was a short buckler intended merely for defense. The word rendered <em>buckler </em>is <span class="lang he-il">צנה</span>, <em>tsinnah, </em>for an account of which see note, p. 64. The <em>tsinnah </em>was double the weight of the magen, and was carried by the infantry; the magen, being lighter and more manageable, was used by the cavalry. The <em>tsinnah </em>answered to the <em>scutum, </em>and the <em>magen </em>to the <em>clypeus, </em>among the Romans. — See <em>Paxton’s Illustrations of Scripture, </em>vol. 3, pp. 866, 867. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(703)</span> Those who are of opinion that <span class="lang he-il">סגור</span>, <em>segor, </em>is a noun, translate it “the scymitar,” and read, “Draw out the spear, and the scymitar, to oppose my persecutors.” According to <em>Drusius, Vitringa, Michaelis, Dr Kennicott</em>, and others, the word means <span class="lang el-gr">σαγαρις</span>, or scymitar, a sort of battle-axe, which was used by the Persians, Scythians, and other nations in ancient times. </p></div></div>
