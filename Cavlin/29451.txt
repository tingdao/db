<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>What things ye have learned, and received, and heard </em>By this accumulation of terms he intimates, that he was assiduous in inculcating these things. <em>“This </em>was my doctrine — my instruction — my discourse among you.” Hypocrites, on the other hand, insisted upon nothing but ceremonies. Now, it was a dishonorable thing to abandon the holy instruction, <span class="cite-ref">(244)</span> which they had wholly imbibed, and with which they had been thorouglly imbued. </p><p><em>You have seen in me </em>Now, the main thing in a public speaker <span class="cite-ref">(245)</span> should be, that he may speak, not with his mouth merely, but by his life, and procure authority for his doctrine by rectitude of life. Paul, accordingly, procures authority for his exhortation on this ground, that he had, by his life no less than by his mouth, been a leader and master of virtues. </p><p><em>And the God of peace </em>He had spoken of the <em>peace of God; </em>he now more particularly confirms what he had said, by promising that God himself, the Author of peace, will be with them. For the presence of God brings us every kind of blessing: as though he had said, that they would feel that God was present with them to make all things turn out well and prosperously, provided they apply themselves to pious and holy actions. </p><p><strong>(244)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’eust este vne chose dishonneste aux Philippiens de delaisser la sainte doctrine et instruction</span>;” — “It would have been a dishonorable thing for the Philipplans to abandon the holy doctrine and instruction.” </p><p><strong>(245)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En vn prescheur</span>;” — “In a preacher.” </p></div>
