<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Likewise this is the law. </em>I have just confessed that I do not sufficiently understand how these two words, <span class="lang he-il">חטאה</span>, <em>chateah, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">אשם</span><em>, asham, </em>differ from each other; and I have therefore followed the sense which is commonly received, and called them the sin and the trespass-offering, (<em>hostiam pro peccato vel pro delicto.</em>) Although in this second kind of offering he commands the same ceremony to be observed as in the former one, yet he mentions some things which he had before omitted, such as the sprinkling of blood around the altar, the offering of the fat, kidneys, etc., which had not been before expressed. The sum amounts to this, that they were to sacrifice in the same manner, and with the same rites for sin as for trespass, and make not the smallest alteration in the rule laid down for them. </p></div>
