<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Now, therefore. </em>God declares that He will ever be the same, and will constantly persevere <span class="cite-ref">(209)</span> (in blessing them), provided the Israelites do not degenerate, but remain devoted to their Deliverer; at the same time, He reminds them also, wherefore he has been so bountiful to them, viz., that they may continually aspire unto the end of their calling; for He had not willed to perform toward them a single act of liberality, but to purchase them as His peculiar, people. This privilege he sets before them in the word <span class="lang he-il">סגלה</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(210)</span><em>segullah, </em>which means all things most precious, whatever, in fact, is deposited in a treasury; although the word “peculium,” a peculiar possession, by which the old interpreter <span class="cite-ref">(211)</span> has rendered it, is not unsuitable to the passage; because it is plain from the immediate context, that it denotes the separation of this people from all others; since these words directly follow: “for,” or, although “all the earth is mine;” the particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, <em>ki</em>, being often taken adversatively, and there is no doubt but that God would more exalt His grace, by comparing this one nation with the whole world, as it is said in the song of Moses, </p><p>“When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel; for the Lord’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.” (<span class="bvs">Deu_32:8</span>.) </p><p>The sum then is, that whilst the whole earth is in God’s dominion, yet the race of Israel has been chosen by Him to excel all nations. Whence it is evident, that whereas the condition of all is alike, some are not distinguished from others by nature, but by gratuitous adoption; but, in order that they should abide in the possession of so great a blessing, fidelity towards God is required on their part. And, first, they are commanded to listen to his voice, (since no sacrifice is more pleasing to him than obedience, <span class="bvs">1Sa_15:22</span>;) and then a definition of obedience is added, viz., to keep His covenant. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(209)</span> Added from <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(210)</span><span class="lang he-il">סגלה</span>, <em>S.
