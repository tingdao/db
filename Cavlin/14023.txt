<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>I will praise the Lord. </em>David begins the psalm in this way, to induce God to succor him in the calamities with which he was now afflicted. As God continues his favor towards his own people without intermission, all the good he has hitherto done to us should serve to inspire us with confidence and hope, that he will be gracious and merciful to us in the time to come. <span class="cite-ref">(158)</span> There is, indeed, in these words a profession of gratitude for the favors which he has received from God; <span class="cite-ref">(159)</span> but, in remembering his past mercies, he encourages himself to expect succor and aid in future emergencies; and by this means he opens the gate of prayer. <em>The whole heart </em>is taken for an upright or sincere heart, which is opposed to a double heart. Thus he distinguishes himself not only from gross hypocrites, who praise God only with their lips outwardly, without having their hearts in any way affected, but also acknowledges that whatever he had hitherto done which was commendable, proceeded entirely from the pure grace of God. Even irreligious men, I admit, when they have obtained some memorable victory, are ashamed to defraud God of the praise which is due to him; but we see that as soon as they have uttered a single expression in acknowledgement of the assistance God has afforded them, they immediately begin to boast loudly, and to sing triumphs in honor of their own valor, as if they were under no obligations whatever to God. In short, it is a piece of pure mockery when they profess that their exploits have been done by the help of God; for, after having made oblation to Him, they sacrifice to their own counsels, skill, courage, and resources. Observe how the prophet Habakkuk, under the person of one presumptuous king, wisely reproves the ambition which is common to all, (<span class="bvs">Hab_1:16</span>.) Yea, we see that the famous generals of antiquity, who, upon returning victorious from some battle, desired public and solemn thanksgivings <span class="cite-ref">(160)</span> to be decreed in their name to the gods, thought of nothing less than of doing honor to their false deities; but only abused their names under a false pretense, in order thereby to obtain an opportunity of indulging in vain boasting, that their own superior prowess might be acknowledged. <span class="cite-ref">(161)</span> David, therefore, with good reason, affirms that he is unlike the children of this world, whose hypocrisy or fraud is discovered by the wicked and dishonest distribution which they make between God and themselves, <span class="cite-ref">(162)</span> arrogating to themselves the greater part of the praise which they pretended to ascribe to God. He praised God with his whole heart, which they did not; for certainly it is not praising God with the whole heart when a mortal man dares to appropriate the smallest portion of the glory which God claims for himself. God cannot bear with seeing his glory appropriated by the creature in even the smallest degree, so intolerable to him is the sacrilegious arrogance of those who by praising themselves, obscure his glory as far as they can. </p><p><em>I will tell of all thy marvellous works. </em>Here David confirms what I have already said, that he does not treat in this psalm of one victory or one deliverance only; for he proposes to himself in general all the miracles which God had wrought in his behalf, as subjects of meditation. He applies the term <em>marvellous </em>not to all the benefits which he had received from God, but to those more signal and memorable deliverances in which was exhibited a bright and striking manifestation of the divine power. God would have us to acknowledge him as the author of all our blessings; but on some of his gifts he has engraven more evident marks in order the more effectually to awaken our senses, which are otherwise as if asleep or dead. David’s language, therefore, is an acknowledgement that he was preserved of God, not by ordinary means, but by the special power of God, which was conspicuously displayed in this matter; inasmuch as he had stretched forth his hand in a miraculous manner, and above the common and usual way. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(158)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Doit servir pour nous asseurer et faire esperer qu’il nous sera propice et debonnaire, l’advenir</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(159)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De la faveur qu’il a receu, de Dieu</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(160)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Processions</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(161)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin que leurs belles prouesses veissent en cognaissance</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(162)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’ils sont entre Dieu et eux</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
