<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>They found a man, a Cyrenian. </em>This circumstance points out the extreme cruelty both of the Jewish nation and of the soldiers. There is no reason to doubt that it was then the custom for malefactors to carry their own crosses to the place of punishment, but as the only persons who were crucified were robbers, who were men of great bodily strength, they were able to bear such a burden. It was otherwise with Christ, so that the very weakness of his body plainly showed that it was a lamb that was sacrificed. Perhaps, too, in consequence of having been mangled by scourging, and broken down by many acts of outrage, he bent under the weight of the cross. Now the Evangelists relate that the soldiers <em>constrained </em>a man who was a peasant, and of mean rank, <em>to carry the cross; </em>because that punishment was reckoned so detestable, that every person thought himself polluted, if he only happened to put his hand to it. <span class="cite-ref">(265)</span> But God ennobles by his heralds the man who was taken from the lowest dregs of the people to perform a mean and infamous office; for it is not a superfluous matter, that the Evangelists not only mention his name, but inform us also about his country and his children. Nor can there be any doubt that God intended, by this preparation, to remind us that we are of no rank or estimation in ourselves, and that it is only from the cross of his Son that we derive eminence and renown. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(265)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">S’il luy fust advenu d’y mettre la main</span>.” </p></div></div>
