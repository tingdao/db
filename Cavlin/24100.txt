<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_26:45</span><strong>.</strong><em>Sleep on now, and take your rest. </em>It is plain enough, that Christ now speaks ironically, but we must, at the same time, attend to the object of the irony. For Christ, having gained nothing by warning his disciples, not only gives an indirect reproof of their indifference, but threatens, that how indolent so ever they may choose to be, no longer delay will be allowed them. The meaning therefore is, “Having hitherto wasted my words on you, I shall now come to exhort you; but whatever permission I may give you to <em>sleep, </em>the enemies will not allow it to you, but will compel you to watch against your will.” In Mark, it is accordingly added, <em>It is enough; </em>as if he had said, that there is no more time for <em>sleeping. </em>And this is the way in which the Lord usually chastises the indolence of men, that those who wax deaf to words may at length be compelled, by their sufferings, to arouse themselves. Let us, therefore, learn to give immediate attention to the words of the Lord, lest what he wishes to draw from us voluntarily may be too late forced from us by necessity. </p></div>
