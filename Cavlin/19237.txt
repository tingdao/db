<div class="comment-content"><p>He also adds, that they <em>had returned, etc. </em>He shews for what purpose they had conspired, even to <em>return to the vices of their fathers, who had been before them </em>Some render the word “ancestors;” but the meaning of the Prophet is not thus sufficiently expressed, for what he means is, that the Israelites had been refractory from the very beginning, so that God could never subdue their wayward dispositions. It must however be observed, that he speaks not of the most ancient, <em>as </em><span class="lang he-il">הרשנים</span><em>, erashnim </em>arethe ancient who were before them; <span class="cite-ref">(38)</span> but as there had been a continued succession or series of impiety, the Prophet calls them here, the former fathers, who had first begun to shake off the yoke of God even to that day. And he again mentions what we have before noticed, that <em>they were unwining to hear </em>Though ignorance does not wholly clear or absolve us, it yet extenuates a crime; but God shews that the Israelites had been disobedient from the beginning. Though he had by Moses sufficiently taught them, we yet find that they often rose up against Moses. If we inquire of their origin, it appears to have been marked with resolute impiety; they were unwining to obey God. </p><p>He then adds, that <em>they walked after alien gods that they might serve them </em>There is ever an implied contrast between God and idols. God had given them evidences enough of his power and glory, and we may justly say, that he had sufficiently proved himself to he the only true God. How then was it that the; Israelites had given the preference to fictitious gods? Doubtless no unwining error could have been pretended. We hence see that they had rejected the true God and wilfully followed their own devices. He then says, that they <em>might serve them </em>But God had already bound them to himself, as he had redeemed them; when, therefore, they devoted themselves to alien gods, was not their ingratitude thus most fully proved? </p><p>He at length subjoins, by way of explanation, <em>Therefore the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dissolved my covenant </em>He confirms what I have just said, — that they had not erred because the way was unknown, but because they were refractory and untameable in their disposition, and would not bear to hear God, thought he kindly shewed to them what they were to do. But the word covenant expresses more than this, — that God had not only delivered them his precepts by Moses, but had also adopted them as his own people, and at the same time pledged his faith to them, </p><p>“I shall be your God, be ye my people,” (<span class="bvs">Jer_11:4</span>) </p><p>Since then God had so kindly allured them to himself, how monstrous was their rebellion, When they refused to hear his voice! With reference to this the word <span class="lang he-il">ברית</span>, <em>berit, </em>is used; for God had not only delivered to them a rule of life, but also adopted them as his people, that they might be obedient to him. </p><p>By saying that he made a covenant <em>with their fathers, </em>he refers to that time when he brought the people out of Egypt, for then was the race of Abraham united. They were indeed twelve distinct tribes; but there was one head over the people, there was one priesthood, and they formed afterwards one kingdom. God then shews, that though the ten tribes made for themselves in after time another king, and the tribe of Judah was then divided, and there were in this separation some special causes of enmity, they yet had always been of the same disposition, and proved how like their fathers they were, as though he i had said, “They were formerly one people, they are now two, yet they have <em>conspired together; </em>their iniquity is the same, in this they are united; and there is among them a binding <em>together.” </em>It follows — </p><p><strong>(38)</strong> The <em>Sept. </em>have “<span class="lang el-gr">τῶν πρότερον</span> — who were before:” the <em>Vulg. </em>improperly joins it with “iniquities,” — “the former iniquities of the fathers;” the <em>Syriac </em>renders it “ancient,” and the <em>Targum, </em>“former,” both connecting it with “fathers.” The word means the “first,” rather than the “former.” If we take it as connected with “fathers,” then the first fathers with whom the covenant, after they came out of Egypt, was made, are meant; but it may be taken as in apposition with “fathers;” then the first who refused to hear God, are referred to. Taking this view, we may render the verse thus — </p><p><strong>10.</strong>They have turned to the iniquities of their fathers — The first who refused to hearken to my words; And they have walked after alien gods to serve them: Annulled have the house of Israel and the house of Judah My covenant, which I made with their fathers. </p><p>The word for “iniquities” means perversions, distortions, the turning of things to purposes not intended. These are the kinds of iniquities which are meant. Perverting the truth rather than denying or renouncing it, had ever been the sin of the Jews. Instead of worshipping God himself, they worshipped him by means of idols, and through the mediation of inferior gods. This was the perversion. Alien gods were mediators; hence they never renounced God’s worship. But God deemed this as an annulment of his covenant, by which they were required to worship him alone. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
