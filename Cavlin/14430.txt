<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Let not those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me. </em>Because David’s enemies already exulted in the hope of seeing his overthrow and destruction, he prays that God would not suffer them to realize a desire so wicked. In order to render God favorable to his cause, he again protests that they hated him without any fault or occasion on his part, and that it was their own malice which urged them to such cruelty against him; for in order to secure the help of God, it is necessary to come before him with the testimony of a good conscience. </p><p>The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שקר</span><em>, sheker, </em>which we have rendered <em>wrongfully, </em>is by some translated <em>deceitfully, </em>as if David meant that his enemies lay in wait for him. But this is to reason with too much subtilty. Besides, the repetition which immediately follows shows that he complains of their wilful hatred, inasmuch as of their own accord, and from deliberate design, they persecuted a man who had given them no cause of offense, but was their friend and benefactor. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">קרף</span>, <em>karats, </em>here signifies <em>to wink with the eyes askance in mockery, </em>as in <span class="bvs">Psa_22:8</span>, it denotes, <em>to wag the head, </em>and <em>to shoot out the lip. </em></p></div>
