<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_3:6</span><strong>; </strong><span class="bvs">Mar_1:5</span><strong>.</strong><em>And were baptized, confessing their sins </em>This <em>confession </em>was a testimony of <em>repentance: </em>for, as the Lord, in the sacraments, brings himself under obligation to us, as if he had given his own hand-writing, so it is our duty, on the other hand, to reply to him. In <em>Baptism, </em>he declares that our sins are forgiven, and calls us to repentance. That men may come forward, in a right manner, to be baptized, <em>confession of sins </em>is demanded from them: otherwise the whole performance would be nothing but an idle mockery <span class="cite-ref">(254)</span> Let it be observed, that we are here speaking of adults, who ought not, we. are aware, to be admitted indiscriminately into the Church, or introduced by Baptism into the body of Christ, <span class="cite-ref">(255)</span> till an examination has been previously made. <span class="cite-ref">(256)</span></p><p>Hence it is obvious, how absurdly this passage has been tortured by the Papists, to support auricular confession. There were no priests at hand, in whose ears each individual might privately mutter <span class="cite-ref">(257)</span> his sins; nor is it said that they enumerated all their sins; nor are we told that John left in charge to his disciples an ordinary rule for confession. Even granting to Papists all that they ask, confession will belong to Catechumens alone, <span class="cite-ref">(258)</span> and will have no place after Baptism. At all events, the law which they lay down for confession after Baptism, derives no countenance from John’s example. <span class="cite-ref">(259)</span></p><p><strong>(254)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Autrement, tout ce sainct mystere seroit tournee en mines et bas-tellerie</span>.” — “Otherwise, all this holy mystery would be turned into grimaces and buffoonery.” </p><p><strong>(255)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En la communion de Christ</span>;” — “into communion <em>or </em>fellowship with Christ.” </p><p><strong>(256)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Devant qu'ils n'ayent este examinez et interroguez de leur foy</span>;” —”before they have been examined and interrogated as to their faith.” </p><p><strong>(257)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n'y avoit point 1a de prestres, devant lequel un chacun eust peu s'a genouiller l'un apres l'autre, pourbarboter ses pechez en leurs aureilles</span>.” — “There were no priests there, before whom each individual might kneel down, one after another, to mutter his sins in their ears.” </p><p><strong>(258)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceste confession n'appartient droit qu'a ceux qui de nouveau se convertissent a la foy</span>.” — “That confession would only belong to those who are recently converted to the faith.” </p><p><strong>(259)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour le moins, quand ils commandent par leur loy de se confesser depuis le Baptesme, ils ne peuvent pas dire qu’ils ensuivent Jean, ny l’alleguer pour autheur</span>.” — “At least, when they enjoin, by their law, to make confession after Baptism, they cannot say that they follow John, nor produce him as their author.” </p></div>
