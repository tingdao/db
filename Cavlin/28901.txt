<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Giving no offense </em>We have already on several occasions remarked, that Paul sometimes commends the ministry of the gospel generally, and at other times his own integrity. <span class="cite-ref">(581)</span> In the present instance, then, he speaks of himself, and sets before us in his own person a living picture of a good and faithful apostle, that the Corinthians may be led to see how unfair they were in their judgment, in preferring before him empty blusterers. <span class="cite-ref">(582)</span> For as they assigned the praise to mere pretences, <span class="cite-ref">(583)</span> they held in the highest esteem persons that were effeminate and devoid of zeal, while, on the other hand, as to the best ministers, they cherished no views but such as were mean and abject. Nor is there any reason to doubt, that those very things that Paul makes mention of to his own commendation, had been brought forward by them in part as a ground of contempt; and they were so much the more deserving of reproof, inasmuch as they converted into matter of reproach, what was ground of just praise. </p><p>Paul, therefore, treats here of <em>three </em>things: In the <em>first </em>place, he shows what are the excellences, on the ground of which preachers of the gospel ought to be esteemed; <em>secondly, </em>he shows that he is himself endowed with those excellences; <em>thirdly, </em>he admonishes the Corinthians not to acknowledge as Christ’s servants those who conduct themselves otherwise than he prescribes here by his example. His design is, that he may procure authority for himself and those that were like him, with a view to the glory of God and the good of the Church, or may restore it where it has fallen into decay; and <em>secondly, </em>that he may call back the Corinthians from an unreasonable attachment to the false apostles, which was a hinderance in the way of their making so much proficiency in the gospel as was necessary. Ministers give occasion of stumbling, when by their own misconduct they hinder the progress of the gospel on the part of their hearers. <em>That </em>Paul says he does not do; for he declares that he carefully takes heed not to stain his apostleship by any spot of disgrace. </p><p>For this is the artifice of Satan — to seek some misconduct on the part of ministers, that may tend to the dishonor of the gospel. For when he has been successful in bringing the ministry into contempt, all hope of profit is at an end. Hence the man who would usefully serve Christ, must strive with his whole might to maintain the credit of his ministry. The method is — to take care that he be deserving of honor, for nothing is more ridiculous than striving to maintain your reputation before others, while you call forth upon yourself reproach by a wicked and base life. That man, therefore, will alone be honorable, who will allow himself in nothing that is unworthy of a minister of Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(581)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tantost met en auaut la rondeur de sa conscience en la predication d’iceluy</span>;” — “Sometimes he brings into view the uprightness of his conscience in the preaching of it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(582)</span> “Thrasones.” See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 98, n. 1. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(583)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne faisans cas que de masques, c’est A dire, de l’apparence externelle</span>;” — “Setting no value on anything but masks; that is to say, outward appearance.” </p></div></div>
