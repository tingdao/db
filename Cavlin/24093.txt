<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>My soul is sorrowful. </em>He communicates to them his <em>sorrow, </em>in order to arouse them to sympathy; not that he was unacquainted with their weakness, but in order that they might afterwards be more ashamed of their carelessness. This phrase expresses a deadly wound of grief; as if he had said, that he fainted, or was half-dead, with <em>sorrow. </em>Jonah (<span class="bvs">Jon_4:9</span>) makes use of a similar phrase in replying to the Lord; <em>I am angry even to death. </em>I advert to this, because some of the ancient writers, in handling this passage with a misapplication of ingenuity, philosophize in this way, that <em>the soul </em>of Christ was not <em>sorrowful in death </em>but only <em>even to death. </em>And here again we ought to remember the cause of so great <em>sorrow; </em>for <em>death </em>in itself would not have so grievously tormented the mind of the Son of God, if he had not felt that he had to deal with the judgment of God. </p></div>
