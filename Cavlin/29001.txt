Their serving gratuitously was a show of uncommon zeal. <span class="cite-ref">(832)</span> If Paul had availed himself of his right, he would have given them occasion to raise their crest, as if they had been greatly superior to him. Paul, accordingly, that he might give them no occasion of doing injury, did himself, also, preach the Gospel, free of charge, and this is what he adds — that he is desirous to <em>cut off occasion from those that desire occasion </em>For the false Apostles were desirous to insinuate themselves by this artifice, and to detract, in proportion to this, from Paul’s credit, if they were superior to him in any respect. He says, that he will not give them this advantage. “They will be found,” says he, “on a level with us in that glorying which they would wish to have for themselves exclusively.” This, however, is a useful admonition in connection with cutting off occasion from the wicked, as often as they desire one. For this is the only way to overcome them — not in the way of furnishing them with arms through our imprudence. <span class="cite-ref">(833)</span></p><p><strong>(831)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’estoit vne fausse monstre de quelque zele excellent, de seruir sans rien prendre</span>;” — “It was a false show of eminent zeal, to serve without taking any thing.” </p><p><strong>(832)</strong><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">De la resolution qu’il a prinse en cest endroit</span>;” — “Of the resolution that he had taken as to this matter.” </p><p><strong>(833)</strong><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Par nostre imprudence et inconsideration</span>;” — “By our imprudence and inconsideration.” </p></div>
