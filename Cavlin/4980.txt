He says that sixty, <em>well-fortified cities </em>were taken, besides the villages. Hence we infer both the extent of the country, and also the special power of God in the aid He afforded them, in that they took, in so short a time, so many cities well closed in, and begirt with high walls; as if they were merely travelling, through a peaceful land in security, and with nothing to do. </p><p>After the eighth verse, lie repeats connectedly what he had separately related respecting the two kingdoms; and in order that the places might be more certainly identified, he mentions two other names for mount Hermon, stating that it was called Sirion by the Sidonians, and Shenir by the Amorites. Finally, he adds that Og, king of Bashan, was a giant, and the only survivorof that race. As a memorialof his lofty stature, he alleges his iron bedstead, the length of which was as much as nine cubits, according to the common measure of that period. By this circumstance he again magnifies the marvellous help of God, in that he was overcome by the children of Israel, who might, by his stature, have singly terrified a whole army. </p><p>The enormous stature of the giants is apparent from this passage. Herodotus records, <span class="cite-ref">(136)</span> that the body of Orestes, disinterred by command of the oracle, was seven cubits in length. Pliny, <span class="cite-ref">(137)</span> although he does not cite his authority, subscribes to this testimony. Gellius <span class="cite-ref">(138)</span> thinks that this was fabulous, as also what Homer <span class="cite-ref">(139)</span> writes with respect to the diminution of men’s height in process of time; but his erroneous view is confuted by almost universal consent. What Pliny <span class="cite-ref">(140)</span> himself relates is indeed incredible, that in Crete a body was discovered, by an opening of the earth, forty-six cubits long, which some thought to be the body of Orion, and others of Etion. But if we believe that there were giants, (which is not only affirmd by the sacred Scriptures, but also recorded by almost all ancient writers,) we need not be surprised if they were more than eight cubits in height. Although, however, the race of giants began to disappear in the time of Moses, still, in after ages, there existed persons who approached to this ancient stature, <span class="cite-ref">(141)</span> as in the time of Augustus and Claudius there was one man about ten feet in height, and another nine feet nine inches. Moses, therefore, intimates nothing more than that this monstrous race of men gradually died out, so that the enormous height of Og, king of Bashan, was an unusual sight. </p><p><strong>(136)</strong> Herod, Clio, Section 68. </p><p><strong>(137)</strong> Pliny, 7:16. </p><p><strong>(138)</strong> Gellius, lib. 3:10. </p><p><strong>(139)</strong> Homer, <em>I1. </em>lib. 12:381-3, 446-9; lib. 20:286, 7. </p><p><strong>(140)</strong> Pliny, lib. 7:16. </p><p><strong>(141)</strong><em>Fr. </em>“Comme sous l’empire d’Auguste il y avoit un homme haut de dix pieds, et sous l’empire de Claude un un peu moindre;” as under the empire of Augustus there was a man ten feet high, and, under that of Claudius, one somewhat shorter. Pliny, <em>loc. cit., </em>records the exhibition at Rome, by the Emperor Claudius, of an Arab named Gabbara, whose height was nine feet nine inches; and adds, that in the reign of Augustus, there lived <em>two </em>persons, Posio and Secundilla, who were half a foot higher than Gabbara, and who, on account of their wonderful size, were buried in the cemetery of the Sallustian gardens. </p></div>
