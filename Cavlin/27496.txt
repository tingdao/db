<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>In the day of the Sabbaths. </em>No doubt the Jews sought some place which was solitary and by the way, when they were disposed to pray, because their religion was then everywhere most odious. And God, by their example, meant to teach us what great account we ought to make of the profession of faith; that we do not forsake it either for fear of envy or of dangers. They had, indeed, in many places synagogues, but it was not lawful for them to assemble themselves publicly at Philippi, which was a free city of Rome.<span class="cite-ref">(180)</span> Therefore, they withdraw themselves into a secret corner, that they may pray to God where they could not be espied; and yet there were those who did grudge even at this, so that they might think that it might both cause trouble and danger, but they prefer the worship of God before their own quietness and commodity. Furthermore, we may gather by this word Sabbath, that Luke speaketh of the Jews. Secondly, forasmuch as he commendeth the godliness of Lydia, it must needs be that she was a Jewess, which matter needeth no long disputation, forasmuch as we know that it was an heinous offense for the Grecians and Romans to celebrate the Sabbath, or to take up Jewish rites. Now, we understand that the Jews made choice of the river’s bank, but because they shunned the company of men, and the sight of the people. If any man object, why did not every man pray in his house privately? The answer is ready, that this was a solemn rite of praying, to testify godliness; and that being far<span class="cite-ref">(181)</span> from the superstitions of the Gentiles, they might one exhort another to worship God alone, and that they might nourish the religion received of the fathers among themselves. As touching Paul and his fellows who were lately come,<span class="cite-ref">(182)</span> it is to be thought that they came thither not only to pray, but also because they hope to do some good. For it was a fit place for them to teach in, being far from noise; and it was meet that they should be more attentive to hear the word who came thither to pray. Luke putteth the day of the Sabbaths instead of the Sabbath; where, following Erasmus, I have translated it, <em>There was wont </em>to be prayer; the old interpreter hath, <em>did seem</em>. And the word [ <span class="lang el-gr">νομιζεσθαι</span> ] hath both significations among the Grecians. Yet this sense is more fit for this present place, that they did commonly use to have prayer there.</p><p><em>We spake to the women. </em>Either that place was appointed for the assemblies of women,<span class="cite-ref">(183)</span> or else religion was cold among men, so that they came more slowly. Howsoever it be, we see that the holy men omit no occasion or opportunity, because they vouchsafed to offer the gospel even to women alone. Furthermore, forasmuch as it seemeth likely to me that men and women made their prayers there together, I suppose that Luke omitted the men either because they would not hear, or else because they profited nothing by hearing.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(180)</span></p><p>“ Colonia Romana,” a Roman colony. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(181)</span></p><p>“ Remoti,” removed, at a distance from. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(182)</span></p><p>“ Novi hospites,” new guests. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(183)</span></p><p>“ Tantum,” only, omitted. </p></div></div>
