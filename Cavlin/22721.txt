<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet, in order to gain credit to his prophecy, produces here the ensample of Alexandria. It is indeed certain, from many testimonies of Scripture, that Alexandria is called No, which was a very ancient city, situated on the confines of Africa, and yet in Egypt. It might, at the same time, be, that the Alexandrians formerly had their own government, at least their own kings: and this is probable; for the Prophet says here, that Egypt and Ethiopia, as well as Africa and the Libyan nations, were the confederates of this city. It may hence then be concluded, that Alexandria was not then a part of Egypt, but had its own government, and was in alliance with the Egyptians, as with the other nations. But as Egypt, after the death of our Prophet, was in part overthrown by the Assyrians, and in part by the Chaldeans, some interpreters think, that the Prophet speaks of a ruin which had not yet taken place. <span class="cite-ref">(243)</span> But this would not harmonize with his design; for the Prophet shows here, as in a mirror, that the chief empires fall according to the will of God, and that cities, the richest and the best fortified, come to nothing, whenever it pleases God. Unless, then, the destruction of Alexandria was notorious and everywhere known, the Prophet could not have suitably adduced this example: I therefore doubt not but that Alexandria had been then demolished. It is no matter of wonder that it afterwards returned to its former state and became rich; for the situation of the city was most commodious, not so much on account of the fertility of the land, as on account of its traffic; for ships from the Mediterranean sailed up near to it. It had, indeed, on one side, the lake Marcotis, which is not very healthy; and then the sea fortified it; and Pharos was a neighboring island: but yet the city was inhabited by many, and adorned with splendid buildings; for the advantage of traffic drew together inhabitants from all quarters. It was afterwards built again by Alexander of Macedon. But it is evident enough that it had been already an opulent city: for Alexander did not build a new city but enlarged it. <span class="cite-ref">(244)</span> Let us now come to the words of the Prophet. </p><p><em>Shall it be better to thee than to Alexandria? </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">אמון</span>, <em>amun</em>, some render populous; and I am inclined to adopt this meaning, which has been received nearly by the consent of all. Others have supposed it to be the name of a king; but as proof fails them, I leave to themselves their own conjecture. <em>Shall it then be better to thee than to Alexandria? </em>For <em>it stood, </em>he says, <em>between the rivers </em>Alexandria had the Nile, as it were, under its own power; for it was then divided into many parts, so that it intersected the city in various places. So then he says, that Alexandria dwelt between the rivers; for it divided the Nile, as it suited its convenience, into several streams. </p><p>Then he says, <em>The sea was around her: </em>for it was surrounded on one side by the sea, and protected by the island Pharos, which had a tower, not only for the sake of defense, but that ships coming in from the Mediterranean, might have a signal, by which they might direct their course straight to the harbor. <em>The sea </em>then <em>was around her; </em>for the sea encircled more than half of the city; and then the lake Mareotis was on the other side to the south. He afterwards adds<em>, And its wall </em>or moat <em>was the sea </em>The word is written with <span class="lang he-il">י</span>, <em>iod, </em><span class="lang he-il">חיל</span>, <em>chil</em>; but it means a wall or a moat, though Latins render antemurale — a front-work: for they were wont formerly to fortify their cities with a double wall, as old buildings still show. According to these interpreters <span class="lang he-il">חיל</span>, <em>chil, </em>is the inner wall, and so they render its front-work: and there was also an outer wall towards the sea. But we may take <span class="lang he-il">חיל</span>, <em>chil, </em>for a moat or a trench; and it is easy to find from other passages that it was a trench rather than a front-work. It is said that the body of Jezebel was torn by dogs in the trench, and the word there is <span class="lang he-il">חיל</span>, <em>chil</em>. As to the object of the Prophet, he evidently intended to show, that Alexandria was so well fortified, that Nineveh had no reason to think herself to be in a safer state; for its fortress was from the sea, and also from Ethiopia, on account of the munitions which he has mentioned. Then he speaks of <em>Africa </em>and <em>Egypt, </em>and the Libyan nations, <span class="cite-ref">(245)</span> and says in short, that there was no end of her strength; that is, that she could seek the help of many friends and confederates: many were ready to bring aid, even Africa, Ethiopia, and the Lybians. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(243)</span> So does <em>Newcome, </em>but with no countenance from the passage. The verb in the 10<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse which refers to the captivity of No, is in the past tense. Most commentators regard the event as having passed. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(244)</span> Opinions differ as to No. <em>Bochart </em>supposed it to be <em>Diospolis, </em>near Mendes, in Lower Egypt. <em>Henderson </em>says, that later commentators are in favor of <em>Thebes, </em>the ancient capital of Upper Egypt. It is of no consequence to the present purpose which it was. It was some celebrated city in Egypt, whose ruin was well known in the Prophet’s time. Both the Rabbins and early Fathers thought that it was what was afterwards called Alexandria. But most probably it was a city which had lost its name and existence from the catastrophe that is here mentioned. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(245)</span> The original names in this verse are <span class="lang he-il">כוש</span>, supposed to be Ethiopia, — <span class="lang he-il">מצרים</span>, Egypt, here, either Upper or Lower, — <span class="lang he-il">פוט</span>, Put, a country to the west of Lower Egypt, its inhabitants the descendants of Ham, <span class="bvs">Gen_10:6</span>, — <span class="lang he-il">לובים</span>, Lybians, who occupied the region between Put and Numidia. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
