<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>And ye shall eat it. </em>Because the tithes were reckoned to be amongst the sacred oblations, a question might arise, whether it was lawful to eat them anywhere except in the sanctuary. God therefore declares, that when the Levites had separated the <span class="lang el-gr">δευυτεροδεκάτας</span> (the second tithes,) the residue passed into the nature and condition of ordinary meats; inasmuch as they might then eat in any place of the bread made of tithe-corn, like the produce of their own fields. The reason, which is subjoined, seems to be by no means appropriate; via, that it was the reward for the labor which they bestowed on the service of the tabernacle; for hence it was rather to be inferred, that this food was peculiarly destined for the ministers, whilst they were discharging their official duties, and keeping watch in the tabernacle, or killing the victims at the altar. But since by God’s command they were scattered over the whole land, and did not cease to be ministers of the tabernacle on account of the distance of their residence, it was justly permitted that, wherever they might be, they should eat of the meat appointed them by God. If it were allowable to <em>take </em>the particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, <em>ki, </em><span class="cite-ref">(225)</span> adversatively, the sense would be clearer. In the next verse he confirms the same declaration, <em>i.e., </em>that they should be free from all guilt when they had honestly paid the priests. Yet at the same time they are strictly admonished that they should not commit themselves by any fraud; for God declares that it would amount to sacrilege, if they should have thievishly embezzled any of it, and threatens them with capital punishment; for “to pollute the holy things” of the people, is equivalent to profaning whatever was consecrated in the name of the whole people. </p><p><strong>(225)</strong><span class="lang he-il">כי</span><em>for, </em>or <em>because. </em>—<em>W. </em></p><p>"<span class="lang fr-fr">On pourroit aussi translater, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Combien </em><span class="lang fr-fr">que ce soit votre loyer</span>;” it might also be translated, although this is your reward. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
