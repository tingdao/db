<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>For they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten. </em>He brings forward the crime with which they were chargeable, to make it manifest that they richly deserved such dreadful punishments. Some explain the verse in this way: “These enemies, O Lord! not content with the strokes which thou hast inflicted, have exercised their cruelty upon a wretched man, who had already been wounded by thy hand.” And as it is the dictate of humanity to succor the afflicted, he who treads down the oppressed most assuredly betrays the brutal cruelty of his disposition. Others reject this exposition, whether upon sufficient ground I know not, observing that David, properly speaking, was not stricken or wounded by the hand of God, it being of the violent rage of his enemies that he complains through the whole of the psalm. Accordingly, they have recourse to a subtle interpretation, and view David as meaning that his enemies wickedly pretended that they had just cause against him, and boasted of being the ministers of God, whose office it was to execute punishment upon him as a wicked person. This is a pretext under which the wicked generally shield themselves, and by which they are led to think that they may lawfully do what they please against those who are in misery, without ever being called to account for it. Thus we find this purpose of the wicked expressed in another place, </p><p>“Come let us persecute him, for God hath forsaken him; <LineBreak />for there is none to deliver him,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_71:11</span>.) </p><p>But I am rather of opinion that the Psalmist applies the term <em>smitten </em>to the man whom God intended to humble as one of his own children; so that in the very chastisement or correction, there was engraven a mark of God’s paternal love. And he employs the expression, <em>the wounded of God, </em>almost in the same sense in which <span class="bvs">Isa_26:19</span> speaks of <em>the dead of God, </em>the prophet thereby denoting those who continue under the Divine guardianship, even in death itself. This cannot be extended to all men in general, but is exclusively applicable to true believers, whose obedience God puts to the test by means of afflictions. If from this the wicked take occasion to persecute the righteous with greater severity, it is not to be wondered at if they involve themselves in heavier damnation. Upon seeing such examples set before them, the manner in which they should have reasoned with themselves is this, </p><p>“If these things are done in a green tree, <LineBreak />what shall be done in the dry?” (<span class="bvs">Luk_23:31</span>.) </p><p>But from their becoming more and more hardened, it is evident that the pride and insolence which they manifest against the children of God proceed from contempt and hatred of true religion. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">יספרו</span>, <em>yesapperu, </em>which is usually translated <em>they will recount, </em>I would interpret differently. It properly signifies <em>to number, </em>and may, therefore, be properly enough translated <em>to add to </em>or <em>increase, </em><span class="cite-ref">(90)</span> giving here the meaning, That the persons spoken of, by adding misery to misery, raised grief to its utmost height. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(90)</span> This is the translation given by the LXX., who read, <span class="lang el-gr">προσέθηκαν</span>, “they added to;” and similar is that of the Syriac, Vulgate, Arabic, and Æthiopic versions, and of the learned Castellio, who reads, “Sauciorum tuorum numerum adaugentes,” “increasing the number of thy wounded.” “<span class="lang he-il">ספר</span>,” says Hammond, “signifies <em>to number</em>, and of that we know <em>addition </em>is one sort.” </p></div></div>
