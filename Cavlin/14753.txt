<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>He hath sent his hands against those that were at peace with him </em>He afterwards speaks in verse 23d in the plural number, but here it is probable that he begins by addressing the leader and head of the wicked conspiracy. He accuses him of waging war in the midst of peace, and being thus guilty of a breach of faith. He had neither suffered provocation, nor had he announced in an open manner his intention to give battle, but had commenced the attack unexpectedly and with treachery. The same charge is insisted upon still further, when it is added, that butter and oil were in his lips, while war was in his heart, and his words themselves were darts. To appearance they were soft and agreeable, but they covered a hidden virulence and cruelty which wounded like a sword or like darts, <span class="cite-ref">(320)</span> according to the common proverb, that deceivers carry on their lips poison besmeared with honey. It is well known how many fair promises and flatteries Saul addressed to David with a view to entrap him, and we may conjecture that the same arts were practiced by his courtiers. It is one special trial of the Lord’s people, that they are exposed to such attempts on the part of crafty men to seduce them into destruction. Here the Holy Spirit puts a mark of reprobation upon all subtilty of this kind, and particularly upon treacherous flatteries, exhorting us to cultivate simplicity of intention. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(320)</span> In the figurative language of the East, severe, unfeeling, and injurious words are often compared to swords, daggers, arrows, etc. Thus it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_59:7</span>, “Swords are in their lips; for who, <em>say they</em>, doth hear?” and in <span class="bvs">Pro_12:18</span>, “There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword.” In our own language, a similar figure of speech is quite common, as when we speak of <em>keen</em>, <em>cutting</em>, and <em>piercing </em>words, and of the wounds which they inflict. “I will speak daggers to her.” —<em>Hamlet</em>. </p></div></div>
