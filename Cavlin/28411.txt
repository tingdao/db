<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And I, brethren </em>He begins to apply to the Corinthians themselves, that he had said respecting carnal persons, that they may understand that the fault was their own — that the doctrine of the Cross had not more charms for them. It is probable, that in mercantile minds like theirs there was too much confidence and arrogance still lingering, so that it was not without much ado and great difficulty that they could bring themselves to embrace the simplicity of the gospel. Hence it was, that undervaluing the Apostle, and the divine efficacy of his preaching, they were more prepared to listen to those teachers that were subtle and showy, while destitute of the Spirit. <span class="cite-ref">(145)</span> Hence, with the view of beating down so much the better their insolence, he declares, that they belong to the company of those who, stupefied by carnal sense, are not prepared to receive the spiritual wisdom of God. He softens down, it is true, the harshness of his reproach by calling them <em>brethren</em>, but at the same time he brings it forward expressly as a matter of reproach against them, that their minds were suffocated with the darkness of the flesh to such a degree that it formed a hindrance to his preaching among them. What sort of sound judgment then must they have, when they are not fit and prepared as yet even for hearing! He does not mean, however, that they were altogether <em>carnal</em>, so as to have not one spark of the Spirit of God — but that they had still greatly too much of carnal sense, so that the flesh prevailed over the Spirit, and did as it were drown out his light. Hence, although they were not altogether destitute of grace, yet, as they had more of the flesh than of the Spirit, they are on that account termed <em>carnal </em>This sufficiently appears from what he immediately adds — that they were <em>babes in Christ</em>; for they would not have been <em>babes </em>had they not been begotten, and that begetting is from the Spirit of God. </p><p><em>Babes in Christ </em>This term is sometimes taken in a good sense, as it is by Peter, who exhorts us to be like <em>new-born babes</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Pe_2:2</span>,) and in that saying of Christ, </p><p>Unless ye become as these little children, <LineBreak />ye shall not enter into the kingdom of God, (<span class="bvs">Luk_18:17</span>.) </p><p>Here, however, it is taken in a bad sense, as referring to the understanding. For we must be <em>children in malice</em>, <em>but not in understanding</em>, as he says afterwards in <span class="bvs">1Co_14:20</span>, — a distinction which removes all occasion of doubt as to the meaning. To this also there is a corresponding passage in <span class="bvs">Eph_4:14</span>. </p><p>That we be no longer children tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, and made the sport <span class="cite-ref">(146)</span> of human fallacies, but may day by day grow up, <em>etc </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(145)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien qu’il n’y eust en eux ancunc efficace de l’Esprit</span>;” — “Though there was in them no efficacy of the Spirit.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(146)</span> Our author gives in this, as in many other instances, the substance of the passage quoted rather than the <em>express words </em>In the expression “<em>made the sport of </em>human fallacies,” he seems to have had in his eye the term <span class="lang el-gr">κυβεια</span> — rendered by our translators <em>sleight </em>(of men,) which, as Calvin himself remarks when commenting upon the passage, is “translatum ab <em>aleatoribus</em>, quod inter eos multae sint <em>fallendi </em>artes :” borrowed from <em>players at dice</em>, there being many arts of <em>deception </em>practiced among them. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
