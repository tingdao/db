<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Is Christ divided? </em>This intolerable evil was consequent upon the divisions that prevailed among the Corinthians: for Christ alone must reign in the Church. And as the object of the gospel is, that we be reconciled to God through him, it is necessary, in the first place, that we should all be bound together in him. As, however, only a very few of the Corinthians, who were in a sounder condition than the others, <span class="cite-ref">(64)</span> retained Christ as their Master, (while all made it their boast that they were Christians,) Christ was by this means torn asunder. For we must be one body, if we would be kept together under him as our head. If, on the other hand, we are split asunder into different bodies, we start aside from him also. Hence to glory in his name amidst strifes and parties is to tear him in pieces: which indeed is impossible, for never will he depart from unity and concord, because “He cannot deny himself” (<span class="bvs">2Ti_2:13</span>.) Paul, therefore, by setting before them this absurdity, designs to lead the Corinthians to perceive that they are estranged from Christ, inasmuch as they are divided, for <em>then </em>only does he reign in us, when we have him as the bond of an inviolably sacred unity. </p><p><em>Was Paul crucified for you? </em>By two powerful considerations, he shows how base a thing <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span> it is to rob Christ of the honor of being the sole Head of the Church — the sole Teacher — the sole Master; or to draw away from him any part of that honor, with the view of transferring it to men. The <em>first </em>is, that we have been redeemed by Christ on this footing, that we are not our own masters. This very argument Paul makes use of in his Epistle to the Romans (<span class="bvs">Rom_14:9</span>,) when he says, </p><p>“For this end Christ died and rose again, that he might be Lord both of the living and the dead.” </p><p>To him, therefore, let us live and die, because we are always his. Also in this same Epistle (<span class="bvs">1Co_7:23</span>,) </p><p>“Ye are bought with a price: be not ye the servants of men.” </p><p>As the Corinthians, therefore, had been purchased with the blood of Christ, they in a manner renounced the benefit of redemption, when they attached themselves to other leaders. Here is a doctrine that is deserving of special notice — that we are not at liberty to put ourselves under bondage to men, <span class="cite-ref">(66)</span> because we are the Lord’s heritage. Here, therefore, he accuses the Corinthians of the basest ingratitude, in estranging themselves from that Leader, by whose blood they had been redeemed, however they might have done so unwittingly. </p><p>Farther, this passage militates against the wicked contrivance of Papists, by which they attempt to bolster up their system of indulgences. For it is from the blood of Christ and the martyrs <span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> that they make up that imaginary treasure of the Church, which they tell us is dealt out by means of indulgences. Thus they pretend that the martyrs by their death merited something for us in the sight of God, that we may seek help from this source for obtaining the pardon of our sins. They will deny, indeed, that they are on that account our redeemers; but nothing is more manifest than that the one thing follows from the other. The question is as to the reconciling of sinners to God; the question is as to the obtaining of forgiveness; the question is as to the appeasing of the Lord’s anger; the question is as to redemption from our iniquities. This they boast is accomplished partly by the blood of Christ, and partly by that of the martyrs. They make, therefore, the martyrs partners with Christ in procuring our salvation. Here, however, Paul in strong terms denies that any one but Christ has been crucified for us. The martyrs, it is true, died for our benefit, but (as Leo <span class="cite-ref">(68)</span> observes) it was to furnish an example of perseverance, not to procure for us the gift of righteousness. </p><p><em>Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? </em>Here we have <em>a second </em>argument, which is taken from the profession of baptism; for we enlist ourselves under the banners of him in whose name we are baptized. We are, accordingly, bound <span class="cite-ref">(69)</span> to Christ, in whose name our baptism is celebrated. Hence it follows that the Corinthians are chargeable with perfidy and apostasy, if they place themselves under subjection to men. Observe here that the nature of baptism resembles a contract <span class="cite-ref">(70)</span> of mutual obligation; for as the Lord by that symbol receives us into his household, and introduces us among his people, so we pledge our fidelity to him, that we will never afterwards have any other spiritual Lord. Hence as it is on God’s part a covenant of grace that he contracts with us, in which he promises forgiveness of sins and a new life, so on our part it is an oath of spiritual warfare, in which we promise perpetual subjection to him. The former department Paul does not here touch upon, because the subject did not admit of it; but in treating of baptism it ought not to be omitted. Nor does Paul charge the Corinthians with apostasy simply on the ground of their forsaking Christ and betaking themselves to men; but he declares that if they do not adhere to Christ alone — that very thing would make them covenant-breakers. </p><p>It is asked, what it is to be <em>baptized in the name of Christ? </em>I answer that by this expression it is not simply intimated that baptism is founded on the authority of Christ, but depends also on his influence, and does in a manner consist in it; and, in fine, that the whole effect of it depends on this — that the name of Christ is therein invoked. It is asked farther, why it is that Paul says that the Corinthians were <em>baptized in the name of Christ</em>, while Christ himself commanded (<span class="bvs">Mat_28:19</span>) the Apostles to baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. I answer, that in baptism the <em>first </em>thing to be considered is, that God the Father, by planting us in his Church in unmerited goodness, receives us by adoption into the number of his sons. <em>Secondly</em>, as we cannot have any connection with him except by means of reconciliation, we have need of Christ to restore us to the Father’s favor by his blood. <em>Thirdly</em>, as we are by baptism consecrated to God, we need also the interposition of the Holy Spirit, whose office it is to make us new creatures. Nay farther, our being washed in the blood of Christ is peculiarly his work; but as we do not obtain the mercy of the Father, or the grace of the Spirit, otherwise than through Christ alone, it is on good grounds that we speak of him as the peculiar object in view in baptism, and more particularly inscribe his name upon baptism. At the same time this does not by any means exclude the name of the Father and of the Spirit; for when we wish to sum up in short compass the efficacy of baptism, we make mention of Christ alone; but when we are disposed to speak with greater minuteness, the name of the Father and that of the Spirit require to be expressly introduced. </p><p><strong>(64)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mieux avisez que les autres</span>;” — “Better advised than the others.” </p><p><strong>(65)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien c’est vne chose insupportable</span>;” — “How insufferable a thing it is.” </p><p><strong>(66)</strong> “<em>Addicere </em>nos hominibus in servitutem “ — “<span class="lang fr-fr">de nous assuiettir aux hommes en seruitude</span>;” — “To give ourselves up to men, so as to be in bondage to them.” Calvin very probably had in his eye the celebrated sentiment of Horace, (Epistle 1 50:14,) “Nullius <em>addictus </em>jurare in verba magistri;” — “Bound to swear allegiance to no master,” while enforcing the sentiment by a powerful consideration, to which the heathen poet was an entire <em>stranger</em>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(67)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Du sang de Christ, et des martyrs tous ensemble</span>;” — “From the blood of Christ, and of all the martyrs together.” </p><p><strong>(68)</strong><em>Leo</em>, ad Palaestinos, Epistle 81.

The just <em>received </em>crowns, did not <em>give </em>them; and the fortitude of believers produced <em>examples of patience</em>, <em>not gifts of righteousness</em>; for their deaths were for themselves; and none by his final end paid the debt of another, except Christ our Lord, in whom alone all are crucified, all dead, buried, and raised up.” <em>Leo</em>, from whose writings this admirable passage is extracted, was a Roman bishop, who flourished in the fifth century, and was one of the most distinguished men of his age.
