<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>That I may not seem to terrify</em>. Again he touches on the calumny which he had formerly refuted, (<span class="bvs">2Co_10:2</span>,) that he was bold in his writings, while in their presence his courage failed him. On this pretext they disparaged his writings. <span class="cite-ref">(769)</span> “What!” Said they, “will he terrify us by letters when at a distance, while, if present with us, he would scarcely venture to mutter a word!” Lest, therefore, his letters should have less weight, he answers, that no objection is advanced against him, that should either destroy or weaken his credit, and that of his doctrine, for <em>deeds </em>were not to be less valued than <em>words</em>. He was not less powerful in actions when present, than he was by words when absent. Hence it was unfair, that his bodily presence should be looked upon as contemptible. By <em>deed</em>, here, he means, in my opinion, the efficacy and success of his preaching, as well as the excellences that were worthy of an Apostle, and his whole manner of life. <em>Speech</em>, on the other hand, denotes — not the very substance of doctrine, but simply the form of it, and the bark, so to speak: for he would have contended for doctrine with greater keeness. The contempt, however, proceeded from this — that he was deficient in that ornament and splendor of eloquence, which secures favor. <span class="cite-ref">(770)</span></p><p><strong>(769)</strong> "<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils rendoyent ses ecrits contemptibles</span>;" — "They made his writings contemptible." </p><p><strong>(770)</strong> "<span class="lang fr-fr">Par laquelle on acquiert grace enuers les hommes</span>;" — "By which they acquire favor among men." </p></div>
