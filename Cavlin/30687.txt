<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And Enoch also</em>. I rather think that this prophecy was unwritten, than that it was taken from an apocryphal book; for it may have been delivered down by memory to posterity by the ancients. <span class="cite-ref">(197)</span> Were any one to ask, that since similar sentences occur in many parts of Scripture, why did he not quote a testimony written by one of the prophets? the answer is obvious, that he wished to repeat from the oldest antiquity what the Spirit had pronounced respecting them: and this is what the words intimate; for he says expressly that he was <em>the seventh from Adam</em>, in order to commend the antiquity of the prophecy, because it existed in the world before the flood. </p><p>But I have said that this prophecy was known to the Jews by being reported; but if any one thinks otherwise, I will not contend with him, nor, indeed, respecting the epistle itself, whether it be that of Jude or of some other. In things doubtful, I only follow what seems probable. </p><p><em>Behold, the Lord cometh</em>, or <em>came</em>. The past tense, after the manner of the prophets, is used for the future. He says, that the Lord would <em>come with ten thousand of his saints; </em><span class="cite-ref">(198)</span> and by <em>saints </em>he means the faithful as well as angels; for both will adorn the tribunal of Christ, when he shall descend to judge the world. He says, <em>ten thousand</em>, as Daniel also mentions myriads of angels, (<span class="bvs">Dan_7:10</span>;) in order that, the multitude of the ungodly may not, like a violent sea, overwhelm the children of God; but that they may think of this, that the Lord will sometime collect his own people, a part of whom are dwelling in heaven, unseen by us, and a part are hid under a great mass of chaff. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(197)</span> This is the most common opinion. There is no evidence of such a <em>book </em>being known for some time after this epistle was written; and the book so called was probably a forgery, occasioned by this reference to Enoch’s prophecy. See <em>Macknight </em>’<em>s </em>Preface to this Epistle. Until of late, it was supposed to be lost; but in 1821, the late Archbishop <em>Laurence</em>, having found an Ethiopia version of it, published it with a translation. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(198)</span> Literally, “with his holy myriads.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
