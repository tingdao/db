<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And in the faith of his name. </em>When as he saith <em>in the faith of his name, and his name; </em>and again, the <em>faith which is by him; </em>this repetition is a token of a fervent affection, for because he was wholly given to set forth the glory of Christ, he beateth in [inculcateth] the same thing oftentimes. Moreover, we see that when Paul is occupied about the showing and setting forth of the grace of Christ, he thinketh that he hath never spoken enough touching the same; and surely such is the wicked nature of men, that Christ cannot be so highly extolled, and so preached, that his honor can remain sound unto him. Let us, therefore, remember that Peter did use such variety and plenty of words, to the end he might stay us in Christ. As touching the phrase, when as he saith, <em>his name in the faith of his name hath strengthened, </em>he showeth both the cause and the manner; the power of Christ had healed the cripple but by faith. When as he saith, <em>the faith which is by him, by </em>this word he signifieth unto us that our faith cannot arise up unto God unless it be grounded in Christ, and se, consequently, that this our faith doth look unto Christ and stay itself upon him, and so he showeth that there cat be no right faith in God when we pass over this mean. </p><p>Furthermore, as he said before, that he and the other apostles were witnesses of Christâ€™s life, so he doth now declare that this life was manifestly proved unto the Jews by a sign or effect, because they see the cripple healed, in whom they had an excellent and evident token of the Divine power of Christ. And when as in this last member he maketh faith the cause of this soundness, he layeth unthankfulness to their charge by the way, unless they give faith her due praise; and although faith may be referred as well unto the man that was healed as unto the apostles, yet we need not to stand much about this manner, because the power of the gospel is set forth by <em>synecdoche. </em></p></div>
