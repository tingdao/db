<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear. </em>He again repeats what he had formerly said, and here includes everything that belongs to the office of a teacher; for the “opening of the ear” must be understood to refer not only to doctrine, but to the whole calling; that is, when he takes one to be his servant, and intbrms of his duty him whom he has determined to send, when he gives commands, and enjoins him to execute what he commands. But the Lord “opens the ear,” not only when he declares what is his will, but when he powerfully affects a man’s heart and moves him to render obedience, as it is said, </p><p>“Thou hast bored mine ear.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_40:6</span>.) </p><p>And Christ says, </p><p>“Whosoever hath heard and learned from the Father cometh to me.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_6:45</span>.) </p><p>Such is also the import of the second clause, <em>And I was not rebellious, </em>the meaning of which may be thus summed up: “He undertakes nothing at random, but, being fully convinced of God’s calling, he discharges the office of a teacher, though it is laborious and difficult, because he is ready to obey.” </p></div>
