<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Have mercy upon me. </em>David begins, as I have already remarked, by praying for pardon; and his sin having been of an aggravated description, he prays with unwonted earnestness. He does not satisfy himself with one petition. Having mentioned the <em>loving-kindness </em>of the Lord, he adds <em>the multitude of his compassions, </em>to intimate that mercy of an ordinary kind would not suffice for so great a sinner. Had he prayed God to be favorable, simply according to his clemency or goodness, even that would have amounted to a confession that his case was a bad one; but when he speaks of his sin as remissible, only through the countless multitude of the compassions of God, he represents it as peculiarly atrocious. There is an implied antithesis between the greatness of the mercies sought for, and the greatness of the transgression which required them. Still more emphatical is the expression which follows, <em>multiply to wash me </em>Some take <span class="lang he-il">הרבה</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(258)</span><em>herebeh, </em>for a noun, but this is too great a departure from the idiom of the language. The sense, on that supposition, would indeed remain the same, That God would wash him abundantly, and with multiplied washing; but I prefer that form of expression which agrees best with the Hebrew idiom. This, at least, is certain from the expression which he employs, that he felt the stain of his sin to be deep, and to require multiplied washings. Not as if God could experience any difficulty in cleansing the worst sinner, but the more aggravated a man’s sin is, the more earnest naturally are his desires to be delivered from the terrors of conscience. </p><p>The figure itself, as all are aware, is one of frequent occurrence in Scripture. Sin resembles filth or uncleanness, as it pollutes us, and makes us loathsome in the sight of God, and the remission of it is therefore aptly compared to <em>washing </em>This is a truth which should both commend the grace of God to us, and fill us with detestation of sin. Insensible, indeed, must that heart be which is not affected by it! </p><p><strong>(258)</strong> There are here two verbs, <span class="lang he-il">הרבה</span>, <em>herebeh</em>, and <span class="lang he-il">כבסני</span>, <em>kabbeseni</em>, the first signifying <em>to multiply</em>, and the second <em>to wash </em>Many expositors think that the verb <span class="lang he-il">הרבה</span>, <em>herebeh</em>, is used in the sense of an adverb, and they read, <em>Multum lava me </em> “When two verbs of the same tense are joined together, whether a copula goes between them or not, the first is often expressed in Latin by an adverb.” — Glass. Lib. 1, Tract. 3, De Verbo Can. 29, tom. 1, p. 272. See <span class="bvs">Gen_25:1</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_6:10</span></p></div>
