<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>And I will remember my covenant</em>. Moses, by introducing God so often as the speaker, teaches us that the word holds the chief place, and that signs are to be estimated by it. <span class="cite-ref">(294)</span> God, however, speaks after the manner of men, when he says, that at the sight of the rainbow he will remember his covenant. But this mode of speaking has reference to the faith of men, in order that they may reflect, that God, whenever he stretches out his arch over the clouds, is not unmindful of his covenant. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(294)</span> “Precipuas esse verbi partes, et inde aestimanda signa.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Queleprincipal gist en la parole, et que d’icelle il faut estimer les sacramens</span>.” That the principal force is in the word, and that from it we must estimate the sacraments. — <em>French Tr</em>. </p></div></div>
