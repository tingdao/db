<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet confirms what he had already prophesied respecting the Idumeans; but to remove every doubt, he says, that God had <em>sworn</em>; and he introduces God as the speaker, in order that his word might be emphatical. He then declares that God had made an oath respecting the destruction of Bozrah. What is particular is put for what is general; for he includes the whole nation under the name of this city. Nor does he simply declare that the Idumeans would be laid waste and destroyed, but he accumulates words: <em>Bozrah</em>, he says, <em>shall be a waste</em>; <span class="cite-ref">(39)</span> secondly, <em>a reproach</em>; thirdly, <em>a solitude</em>, or desert; and fourthly, <em>a curse </em></p><p>What the Prophet said was no doubt a thing difficult to be believed; for God did not without reason bring forth his own name. For as he would have us to use it seriously and reverently, so he does not interpose so precious a pledge except under the greatest necessity. It is then certain, that there was a weighty reason why God testified by an oath what we read here of the destruction of the people of Edom. Now I have said that what Jeremiah announced was hardly credible; and it was so, because there was no cause for war; and besides, the country was fortified by its own inclosures; for the Idumeans thought, as it seems, that they were impregnable. This, then, was the reason why God interposed an oath. At the same time his purpose was, as I have before reminded you, to consult the benefit of the faithful; for God makes an oath that he might apply a remedy to the weakness of our faith; for as we almost always vacillate, a simple testimony, without being sanctioned by an oath, would not be sufficient for us. This is then the reason for making an oath. </p><p>God is said to swear <em>by himself</em>, because there is none greater; as the apostle says, by whom he can swear. (<span class="bvs">Heb_6:13</span>.) Men in doubtful and hidden things flee to God, who knows the heart, who is himself the truth, and from whom nothing is hid. And an oath, as we learn from many places of Scripture, is a part of divine worship. As then this honor peculiarly belongs to him, that is, that we should swear by his name, when he himself swears, he cannot derive authority from another, which may confirm his words: he therefore swears by himself. And we have heard what he declares by Isaiah, </p><p>“I will not give my glory to another.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_42:8</span>) </p><p>God then prescribes to us the form of swearing, when he swears by himself. God is said to swear sometimes by his soul, or by his life, and he is said sometimes to lift up his hand. These expressions are not strictly proper, but transferred to God from men. But the mode of speaking used by Jeremiah ought especially to be observed, for we see how an oath is to be rightly made, even when it is made by an appeal to God’s name, for he is alone the fit witness and judge in things doubtful and hidden. </p><p>There is therefore under the Papacy a base and an intolerable idolatry, for the Papists swear by dead saints. This is nothing else but to rob God of his right; for since he alone, as it has been stated, is the truth, so he alone is the fit judge when things are hidden and cannot be ascertained by human testimony. And we ought to notice the words used in swearing, that is, when men submit to God’s judgment, and implore him as a judge. Whosoever then swears by the saints, it is the same thing as to make them to occupy the place of God, so as to make them the judges of the world, and to ascribe to them all power. </p><p>“God is a witness to my soul,” </p><p>says Paul, (<span class="bvs">2Co_1:23</span>;) and then we have such words as these, </p><p>“May God do this to me and add that.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rut_1:17</span>; <span class="bvs">1Sa_14:44</span>; <span class="bvs">2Sa_3:35</span>, etc.) </p><p>By such expressions, as I have said, is set forth the authority and character of an oath. In short, we must bear in mind, that when necessity constrains us to swear, God is ever the sole judge, and that therefore his name is profaned when we swear by another. </p><p>Now what it is to be <em>a reproach </em>and <em>a curse</em>, is evident from other places, even when any one is set as it were in a theater, that he might be an example of disgrace, or when any calamity gives an occasion for execrations and maledictions, “May God destroy thee as he destroyed the Idumeans:” this is to be a curse, as we have elsewhere seen. </p><p>He adds <em>cities</em>, and thereby intimates that this desolation would not be confined to one part, but be extended to all parts. He also says that they would be <em>perpetual wastes</em>; and thus he took away every hope of restoration. When he prophesied before against the Moabites and the Ammonites, he mingled some consolation, but as to Edom, every hope is cut off. The nation, no doubt, deserved a heavier vengeance, for it had a nearer connection with the Israelites — hence its cruelty was less to be borne. Besides, it appears that it exceeded in its barbarity all other nations; for it is not without reason said in the Psalms, </p><p>“Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom, who said in the day of Jerusalem, Let it be erased, let it be wholly erased to its foundation.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_137:7</span>) </p><p>We hence learn that the Idumeans raged most cruelly against their own blood: and this was the reason why God declared that their cities would become perpetual desolations; for the word <span class="lang he-il">עולם</span>, <em>oulam</em>, which some render “age,” often means perpetuity. It follows — </p><p><strong>(39)</strong> It is better to render it as in the <em>Syr., </em>“astonishment;” then “reproach” comes after it; and the next word, <span class="lang he-il">חרב</span>, is properly “a waste,” and in the plural is rendered “wastes” at the end of the verse. There were two cities called Bozrah, one in Moab, <span class="bvs">Jer_48:24</span>, and one in Edom, <span class="bvs">Isa_63:1</span> — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
