<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Have respect unto me. </em>As the flesh is ever ready to suggest to our minds that God has forgotten us, when he ceases to manifest his power in aiding us, David here follows the order which nature dictates, in asking God to have respect unto him, as if he had altogether neglected him before. Now, it appears to me that the words might be explained thus: Have respect unto me, in order to pity me. He accounts it at once the cause and the source of his salvation to be regarded of God; and then he adds the effect of it: for as soon as God, of his own good pleasure, shall vouchsafe to regard us, his hand also will be ready to help us. Again, in order to excite the compassion of God, he sets forth his own misery, expressly stating that he is <em>alone, </em>that is to say, <em>solitary; </em><span class="cite-ref">(564)</span> and then he describes himself as <em>poor. </em>There can be no doubt that, in speaking thus, he alludes to the promises in which God declares that he will be always present with the afflicted and oppressed, to aid and help them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(564)</span> The Hebrew word here used is <span class="lang he-il">יחיד</span>, <em>yachid, unus, one, </em>which is not infrequently put, as in this place, for a <em>solitary </em>and <em>desolate </em>person. David was now deserted, desolate, and destitute of all help. The word is used in the same sense in <span class="bvs">Psa_22:20</span>, and <span class="bvs">Psa_35:17</span></p></div></div>
