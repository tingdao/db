<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Behold, I set before you this day</em>. He now embraces the two points at once, viz., that they would be blessed if they earnestly apply themselves to the keeping of the Law, and cursed, if they shake off its yoke and revel in their lusts. But, when he says that he here sets before them a blessing and a curse, it is as much as to declare, that he does not merely tell them what is right, but that the reward is prepared if they obey; and if not, that the punishment is also at hand. Thus we see, that the doctrine which he had hitherto delivered is sealed by hope and fear, since they would not lose their labor if they obeyed it, nor be unpunished if they rejected it. But, that they may learn surely to embrace the promises and to fear the threatenings, he repeats what we have met with before, <span class="cite-ref">(203)</span> that God, who is both a faithful rewarder, and a severe judge, is the Author of the Law; yet at the same time he magnifies his own ministry, <span class="cite-ref">(204)</span> since it behooved them to depend upon God, and to acquiesce in His commandments, in such a manner as still to submit themselves to His Prophet. For such is men’s pride, that they desire to fly above the clouds to listen to God; whilst He would be heard in His servants, by whose mouth He speaks. Moses, therefore, would again enforce upon them this humility, when he states that he enjoins what God has commanded, as if to call himself the organ of the Holy Spirit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(203)</span> Added in <em>Fr</em>. , “Plusieurs fois.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(204)</span> Added in <em>Fr</em>. , “Disant que c’est luy qui commande apres Dieu;” saying that it is he who commands after God. </p></div></div>
