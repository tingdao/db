<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24</strong><em>Now unto him that is able to keep you</em>. He closes the Epistle with praise to God; by which he shews that our exhortations and labors can do nothing except through the power of God accompanying them. <span class="cite-ref">(204)</span></p><p>Some copies have “them” instead of “you.” If we receive this reading, the sense will be, “It is, indeed, your duty to endeavor to save them; but it is God alone who can do this” However, the other reading is what I prefer; in which there is an allusion to the preceding verse; for after having exhorted the faithful to save what was perishing, that they might understand that all their efforts would be vain except God worked with them, he testifies that they could not be otherwise saved than through the power of God. In the latter clause there is indeed a different verb, <span class="lang el-gr">φυλάξαι</span>, which means <em>to guard</em>; so the allusion is to a remoter clause, when he said, <em>Keep yourselves </em></p><p>END OF THE EPISTLE OF JUDE </p><p><strong>(204)</strong> The doxology is as follows, — </p><p>“To the only wise God (or, to the wise God alone) our Savior, be glory and greatness, might and dominion, both now and through all ages.” </p><p>“Dominion” (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐξουσία</span>) is the right to govern, imperial authority or power; “might” (<span class="lang el-gr">κράτος</span>) is strength to effect his purpose, omnipotence; “greatness” (<span class="lang el-gr">μεγαλωσύνη</span>) comprises knowledge, wisdom, holiness, and everything that constitutes what is really great and magnificent; and (<span class="lang el-gr">δόξα</span>) is the result of all these things which belong to God; all terminate in his glory. The ultimate issue is first mentioned, then the things which lead to it. It is by acknowledging his sovereign power, his capacity to exercise that power — his omnipotence, and his greatness in everything that constitutes greatness, that we give him the glory, the honor, and the praise due to his name. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
