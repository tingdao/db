<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Hail, thou who hast obtained favor </em>The angel’s commission being of an astonishing and almost incredible description, he opens it with a commendation of the grace of God. And certainly, since our limited capacities admit too slender a portion of knowledge for comprehending the vast greatness of the works of God, our best remedy is, to elevate them to meditation on his boundless grace. A conviction of the Divine goodness is the entrance of faith, and the angel properly observes this order, that, after preparing the heart of the virgin by meditation on the grace of God, he may enlarge it to receive an incomprehensible mystery. For the participle <span class="lang el-gr">κεχαριτωμένη</span>, which Luke employs, denotes the undeserved favor of God. This appears more clearly from the Epistle to the Ephesians, (<span class="bvs">Eph_1:6</span>,) where, speaking of our reconciliation to <em>God, </em>Paul says, God <em>“ </em>hath made us accepted (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐχαρίτωσεν</span>) in the Beloved:” that is, he has received into his favor, and embraced with kindness, us who were formerly his enemies. </p><p>The angel adds, <em>the Lord is with thee </em>To those on whom he has once bestowed his love God shows himself gracious and kind, follows and <em>“ </em>crowns them with loving-kindness,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_103:4</span>.) Next comes the third clause, that she is <em>blessed among women. Blessing </em>is here put down as the result and proof of the Divine kindness. The word <em>Blessed </em>does not, in my opinion, mean, Worthy of praise; but rather means, Happy. <em>Thus, </em>Paul often supplicates for believers, first “grace” and then “peace,” (<span class="bvs">Rom_1:7</span>; <span class="bvs">Eph_1:2</span>,) that is, every kind of blessings; implying that we shall then be truly happy and rich, when we are beloved by God, from whom all blessings proceed. But if Mary’s happiness, righteousness, and life, flow from the undeserved love of God, if her virtues and all her excellence are nothing more than the Divine kindness, it is the height of absurdity to tell us that we should seek from her what she derives from another quarter in the same manner as ourselves. With extraordinary ignorance have the Papists, by an enchanter’s trick, changed this salutation into a prayer, and have carried their folly so far, that their preachers are not permitted, in the pulpit, to implore the grace of the Spirit, except through their <em>Hail, Mary </em><span class="cite-ref">(23)</span> But not only are these words a simple congratulation. They unwarrantably assume an office which does not belong to them, and which God committed to none but an angel. Their silly ambition leads them into a second blunder, for they salute a person who is absent. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(23)</span> “Ave, Maria.” </p></div></div>
