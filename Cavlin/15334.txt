<div class="comment-content"><p>To the same effect is the following verse, in which it is affirmed, that <em>God is very terrible in the assembly of the saints. </em>In these words is censured that devilish superstition, to which almost all men are prone, of exalting angels beyond measure, and without reason. But if the angels themselves tremble, and are afraid before the Divine Majesty, why should they not be regarded as subjects, and kept in their own rank, that God alone may have the sovereignty entirely to himself? Farther, when they are represented as<em>around God, </em>the meaning is, that they surround his royal throne like body-guards, and are always ready to execute his behests. In the subsequent verse the same thing is repeated yet again, <em>Who is a strong God as thou art? </em>and this is done, that at least the fear of the Divine Majesty may teach us to beware of robbing him of the honor which belongs to him. That we may not, however, by too much fear, be prevented from approaching him, some portion of sweetness is intermingled with this description, when it is declared, that <em>his truth is to be seen round about him on all sides; </em>by which we are to understand, that God is always steadfast in his promises, and that whatever changes may happen, he nevertheless continues invariably true, both before and behind, on the right hand and on the left. <span class="cite-ref">(528)</span></p><p><strong>(528)</strong> Ainsworth reads, “God is daunting terrible.” The original word is <span class="lang he-il">נערף</span>,<em>naarats</em>, from <span class="lang he-il">ערף</span>, <em>arats</em>, <em>he was broken</em>, <em>bruised</em>, <em>terrified</em>. “An epithet of God,” says Bythner “as though breaking all things.” </p></div>
