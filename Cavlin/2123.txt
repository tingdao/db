<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>For all manner of trespass</em>. An action for theft is here permitted, but with a fine attached if any should rashly accuse his neighbor; for else it might be doubted when or for what reasons the restitution of double or quadruple was to be required. He therefore permits that if any one suspects another of theft, he should summon that person to plead his cause; and if he should prove his case, that he should recover double the thing lost; but if the judges should pronounce that he had brought his action groundlessly, that he, on the contrary, should pay the penalty of his false accusation. For such an action as this is not altogether a civil one, but carries with it the stain of infamy, and thus it would be unjust that a man should be injured by false suspicions whom the judges acquit of crime. The word used here for judges is <span class="lang he-il">אלהים</span>, <em>elohim</em>, which properly means gods, as being of the plural number; it is, however often used for God. <span class="cite-ref">(137)</span> It is transferred to judges for the purpose of dignifying their office; because in it they represent the person of God, in whose hand alone is all dominion and power. Therefore Christ says they were called gods, because to them “the word of God came,” ( <span class="bvs">Joh_10:34</span>,) i.e., that they should preside in His name, and be set over others, on which subject we treated under the Fifth Commandment. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(137)</span> “Le Dieu vivant.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
