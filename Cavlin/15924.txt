<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>My soul cleaveth to the dust </em><span class="cite-ref">(409)</span> He means that he had no more hope of life than if he had been shut up in the tomb; and this must be carefully attended to, that we my not become impatient and grieved, whenever it may please God to make us endure various kinds of death. And, by his own example, he instructs us, when death stares us in the face, and all hope of escape fails, to present our petitions to God, in whose hand, as we have elsewhere seen, are the issues of death, and whose peculiar prerogative it is to restore life to those that are dead, (<span class="bvs">Psa_68:21</span>) As the combat is hard, he betakes himself to the promises of God, and invites others to do the same. The expression, <em>according to thy word, </em><span class="cite-ref">(410)</span> is an acknowledgment, that should he depart from God’s word, no hope would be left for him; but as God has affirmed that the life of the faithful is in his hand, and under his protection, shut up as he was in the grave, he yet comforted himself with the expectation of life. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(409)</span> The original word for <em>my soul </em>might here, as in verse 28, be translated <em>I myself</em>, or <em>my life</em>, and then, cleaving to the dust may imply an apprehension of approaching death; and this agrees best with the petition. “By dust is here probably meant the sepulchre or grave, as in <span class="bvs">Psa_22:15</span>, so that the Psalmist is to be understood to say, ‘The dangers which surround me are such as threaten my death;’ and he immediately adds, ‘Revive me according to thy word,’ <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , Make me glad by delivering me from these perils, in agreement with the promises which thou hast given me.” — <em>Walford </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(410)</span> Arnobins and Augustine interpret <em>thy word </em>as signifying, in this place, <em>thy promise</em>. See verse 28, and <span class="bvs">Psa_44:25</span>. </p></div></div>
