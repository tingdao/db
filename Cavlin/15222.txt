<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>For this is a statute to Israel. </em>To give the more effect to the preceding exhortation, it is here taught that this law or ordinance had been prescribed to Godâ€™s ancient people, for the purpose of ratifying the everlasting covenant. And as in covenants there is a mutual agreement between the parties, it is declared that this <em>statute was given to Israel, </em>and that God, in contracting, reserved this for himself, as a right to which he was justly entitled. </p></div>
