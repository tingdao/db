<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And Peter, standing </em>By this word <em>standing </em>he did signify, that there was a grave sermon made in the assembly; for they did rise when they spoke unto the people, to the end they might be the better heard. The sum of this sermon is this, he gathereth that Christ is already revealed and given by the gift of the Holy Ghost, which they saw. Yet, first, he refuteth that false opinion, in that they thought that the disciples were drunk. This refutation consisteth upon a probable argument; because men use not to be drunk betimes in the morning. For, as Paul saith, </p><p>“Those which are drunk are drunk in the night,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Th_5:7</span>.) </p><p>For they flee the light for shame. And surely so great is the filthiness of this vice, that for good causes it hateth the light. And yet this argument were not always good; for Esaias doth inveigh in his time against those which did rise early to follow drunkenness. And at this day there be many who, like hogs, so soon as they awake, run to quaffing. But because this is <span class="cite-ref">(89)</span> a common custom amongst men, Peter saith, that it is no likely thing. Those which have but even small skill in antiquity do know that the civil day, from the rising of the sun until the going down thereof, was divided into twelve hours; so that the hours were longer in summer, and shorter in winter. Therefore, that which should now be the ninth before noon in winter, and in summer the eighth, was the third hour amongst the old people. <span class="cite-ref">(90)</span> Therefore, whereas Peter doth only lightly remove the opinion of drunkenness, he doth it for this cause, because it had been superfluous to have stood about any long excuse. <span class="cite-ref">(91)</span> Therefore, as in a matter which was certain and out of doubt, he doth rather pacify those which mocked, than labor to teach them. And he doth not so much refute them by the circumstance of time, as by the testimony of Joel. For when he saith that that is now come to pass which was foretold, he toucheth briefly their unthankfulness, because they do not acknowledge such an excellent benefit promised unto them in times past which they now see with their eyes. And whereas he upbraideth the fault of a few unto all, <span class="cite-ref">(92)</span> he doth it not to this end, that he may make them all guilty of the same fault; but because a fit occasion was offered by their mocking to teach them altogether, he doth not foreslow the same. <span class="cite-ref">(93)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(89)</span> “Abhorret,” differs from. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(90)</span> “Veteribus,” the ancients. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(91)</span> “Anxia excusatio,” anxious excuse. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(92)</span> “Quod autem omnibus exprobrat paucorum vitium,” as to his upbraiding all with the fault of a few. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(93)</span> “Eam non negligit,” he does not neglect it. </p></div></div>
