<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Come to me all that labor </em>He now kindly invites to himself those whom he acknowledges to be fit for becoming his disciples. Though he is ready to reveal the Father to all, yet the greater part are careless about coming to him, because they are not affected by a conviction of their necessities. Hypocrites give themselves no concern about Christ, because they are intoxicated with their own righteousness, and neither <em>hunger </em>nor <em>thirst </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_5:6</span>) for his grace. Those who are devoted to the world set no value on heavenly life. It would be in vain, therefore, for Christ to invite either of these classes, and therefore he turns to the wretched and afflicted. He speaks of them as <em>laboring, </em>or groaning under a <em>burden, </em>and does not mean generally those who are oppressed with grief and vexations, but those who are overwhelmed by their sins, who are filled with alarm at the wrath of God, and are ready to sink under so weighty a <em>burden. </em>There are various methods, indeed, by which God humbles his elect; but as the greater part of those who are loaded with afflictions still remain obstinate and rebellious, Christ means by persons laboring<em>and burdened, </em>those whose consciences are distressed by their exposure to eternal death, and who are inwardly so pressed down by their miseries that they faint; for this very fainting prepares them for receiving his grace. He tells us that the reason why most men despise his grace is, that they are not sensible of their poverty; but that there is no reason why their pride or folly should keep back afflicted souls that long for relief. </p><p>Let us therefore bid adieu to all who, entangled by the snares of Satan, either are persuaded that they possess a righteousness out of Christ, or imagine that they are happy in this world. Let our miseries drive us to seek Christ; and as he admits none to the enjoyment of his rest but those who sink under the burden, let us learn, that there is no venom more deadly than that slothfulness which is produced in us, either by earthly happiness, or by a false and deceitful opinion of our own righteousness and virtue. Let each of us labor earnestly to arouse himself, first, by vigorously shaking off the luxuries of the world; and, secondly, by laying aside <em>every </em>false confidence. Now though this preparation for coming to Christ makes them as dead men, <span class="cite-ref">(71)</span> yet it ought to be observed, that it is the gift of the Holy Spirit, because it is the commencement of repentance, to which no man aspires in his own strength. Christ did not intend to show what man can do of himself, but only to inform us what must be the feelings of those who come to him. </p><p>They who limit the <em>burden </em>and the <em>labor </em>to ceremonies of the Law, take a very narrow view of Christ’s meaning. I do acknowledge, that the Law was intolerably burdensome, and overwhelmed the souls of worshippers; but we must bear in mind what I have said, that Christ stretches out his hand to all the afflicted, and thus lays down a distinction between his disciples and those who despise the Gospel. But we must attend to the universality of the expression; for Christ included all, without exception, who <em>labor and are burdened, </em>that no man may shut the gate against himself by wicked doubts. <span class="cite-ref">(72)</span> And yet all such persons are few in number; for, among the innumerable multitude of those that perish, few are aware that they are perishing. The <em>relief </em>which he promises consists in the free pardon of sins, which alone gives us peace. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(71)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien que ceste preparation a recevoir la grace de Christ despouille desia entierement les hommes, et monstre qu’ils sont du tout vuides de vertu</span>;” — “though this preparation for receiving the grace of Christ already strips men entirely, and shows that they are wholly devoid of virtue.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(72)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par une desfiance et facon perverse de douter</span>;” — “by a distrust and wicked manner of doubting.” </p></div></div>
