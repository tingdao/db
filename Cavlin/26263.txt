<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>He saith to Philip. </em>What we here read as having been <em>said to Philip </em>alone, the other Evangelists tell us, was said to all. But there is no inconsistency in this; for it is probable that <em>Philip </em>spoke according to the opinion entertained by all, and, therefore, Christ replies to him in particular; just as John, immediately afterwards, introduces Andrew as speaking, where the other Evangelists attribute the discourse to all alike. Perceiving that they have no conception of an extraordinary remedy, he then arouses their minds, which may be said to be asleep, so that they may, at least, have their eyes open to behold what shall be immediately exhibited to them. The design of all that is alleged by the disciples is, to persuade Christ not to detain the people; and, perhaps, in this respect they consult their private advantage, that a part of the inconvenience may not fall upon themselves. Accordingly, Christ disregards their objections, and proceeds in his design. </p></div>
