<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah said, in the passage we considered yesterday, that it was more to be desired that God should keep what remained at Jerusalem, than that what had been taken away should be restored, for the time of punishment had not yet passed away; and thus he condemned the false teachers, because they had presumptuously and boldly promised a quick return as to the king as well as to those who had been led with him into exile, he now confirms the same thing, and says that what remained as yet at Jerusalem was already destined for their enemies the Babylonians, and would become their prey. Nebuchadnezzar had in part spared the Temple and the city; he had taken away chiefly the precious vessels, but had not entirely spoiled the Temple of its ornaments. As, then, some splendor was still to be seen there, the Jews ought to have learned that he had acted kindly towards them. He now says, that the Temple and the city would be destroyed; and this may be gathered from his words when he says, that there would be nothing remaining. </p><p><em>Thus saith Jehovah concerning the pillars, etc</em>. There is no doubt but that Solomon spent much money on the pillars, as the Scripture commends the work. He adds, <em>concerning the sea, </em>which was a very large vessel, for from it the priests took water to wash themselves whenever they entered the Temple to perform their sacred duties. And though it was made of brass, it was yet of no small value on account of its largeness; and for this reason it was called sea. He mentions, in the third place, <em>the bases </em><span class="cite-ref">(190)</span><em>Jerome </em>reads, “To the bases,” for the preposition is <span class="lang he-il">אל</span>, but it means often <em>of</em>, or concerning, as it is well known. He then declares what God had determined as to the pillars as well as the sea and the bases. There were, indeed, other vessels besides; but he specified these in order that the king, and also the people, might know that nothing would be left remaining in the Temple. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(190)</span> Or foundations, those on which the sea or pillars stood.
