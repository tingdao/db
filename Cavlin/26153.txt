<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>And what he hath seen and heard. </em>John proceeds in the discharge of his office; for, in order to procure disciples for Christ, he commends Christâ€™s doctrine as certain, because he utters nothing but what he has received from the Father. <em>Seeing </em>and <em>hearing </em>are contrasted with doubtful opinions, unfounded rumors, and every kind of falsehoods; for he means that Christ teaches nothing but what has been fully ascertained. But some one will say that little credit is due to him who has nothing but <em>what he has heard. </em>I reply, this word denotes that Christ has been taught by the Father, so that he brings forward nothing but what is divine, or, in other words, what has been revealed to him by God. </p><p>Now this belongs to the whole person of Christ, so far as the Father sent him into the world as His ambassador and interpreter. He afterwards charges the world with ingratitude, in basely and wickedly rejecting such an undoubted and faithful interpreter of God. In this way he meets the offense which might cause many to turn aside from the faith, and might hinder or retard the progress of many; for, as we are accustomed to depend too much on the judgment of the world, a considerable number of persons judge of the Gospel by the contempt of the world, or at least, where they see it everywhere rejected, they are prejudiced by that event, and are rendered more unwilling and more slow to believe. And, therefore, whenever we see such obstinacy in the world, let this admonition hold us in constant obedience to the Gospel, that it is truth which came from God. When he says that NO-MAN<em>, receiveth his testimony, </em>he means that there are very few and almost no believers, when compared with the vast crowd of unbelievers. </p></div>
