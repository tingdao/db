<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Let no one therefore judge you. </em>What he had previously said of circumcision he now extends to the difference of meats and days. For circumcision was the first introduction to the observance of the law, other things <span class="cite-ref">(384)</span> followed afterwards. To <em>judge </em>means here, to hold one to be guilty of a crime, or to impose a scruple of conscience, so that we are no longer free. He says, therefore, that it is not in the power of men to make us subject to the observance of rites which Christ has by his death abolished, and exempts us from their yoke, that we may not allow ourselves to be fettered by the laws which they have imposed. He tacitly, however, places Christ in contrast with all mankind, lest any one should extol himself so daringly as to attempt to take away what he has given him. </p><p><em>In respect of a festival-day</em>. Some understand <span class="lang el-gr">τὸ μέρος</span> to mean <em>participation</em>. Chrysostom, accordingly, thinks that he used the term <em>part</em>, because they did not observe all festival days, nor did they even keep holidays strictly, in accordance with the appointment of the law. This, however, is but a poor interpretation. <span class="cite-ref">(385)</span> Consider whether it may not be taken to mean <em>separation</em>, for those that make a distinction of days, separate, as it were, one from another. Such a mode of partition was suitable for the Jews, that they might celebrate religiously <span class="cite-ref">(386)</span> the days that were appointed, by separating them from others. Among Christians, however, such a division has ceased. </p><p>But some one will say, “We still keep up some observance of days.” I answer, that we do not by any means observe days, as though there were any sacredness in holidays, or as though it were not lawful to labor upon them, but that respect is paid to government and order — not to days. And this is what he immediately adds. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(384)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les autres ceremonies</span>;” — “Other rites.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(385)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mats c’est vne conjecture bien maigre</span>;” — “But this is a very slender conjecture.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(386)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estroittement</span>;” — “Strictly.” </p></div></div>
