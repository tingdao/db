<div class="comment-content"><p>As, on a former occasion, Matthew and the other two Evangelists (<span class="bvs">Mat_8:1</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_1:40</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_5:12</span>) related that <em>a leper </em>had been <em>cleansed </em>by Christ, so Luke mentions that the same miracle of healing was performed on <em>ten lepers </em>The object of this narrative, however, is different; for it describes the base and incredible ingratitude of the Jewish nation, to prevent us from wondering that so many of Christ’s favors had been suppressed, and so many of his wonderful works buried, among them. One circumstance, too, is added, which greatly heightens the infamy of their crime. Our Lord had <em>cured nine Jews: </em>yet not one of them returned thanks, but, with the view of obliterating the remembrance of their disease, they privately stole away. One man only—a Samaritan—acknowledged his obligation to Christ. There is, therefore, on the one hand, a display of Christ’s divine power; and, on the other hand, a reproof of the impiety of the Jews, in consequence of which so remarkable a miracle as this received scarcely any attention. </p></div>
