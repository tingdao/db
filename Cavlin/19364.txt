<div class="comment-content"><p>He adds a similitude for the purpose of confirming his doctrine, <em>He shall be like a tamarisk</em>, or a juniper, as some render it. The word <span class="lang he-il">ערער</span>, <em>oror</em>, means a copse. But the Jews themselves are not agreed; some think it to be the juniper, and others the tamarisk; but we may hold it as certain that it was a useless shrub, not fruit-bearing for those Jews are mistaken, in my judgment, who consider it to be the juniper, for some fruit grows on branches of that. It was a shrub or a tree, as I think, unknown to us now. <span class="cite-ref">(173)</span></p><p>Then he says that they were like shrubs which <em>grow in the desert, which see not fruitfulness</em>, but <em>dwell in droughts, in a land of brine</em>. The Hebrews call barren land the land of brine or of salt: and he enlarges on the subject by saying, <em>Which is not inhabited</em>: for where nothing grows there are no inhabitants. The object of the Prophet, then, was merely to shew, that their hopes who look to men would be vain; for God would frustrate thenl, so that they could never succeed. </p><p>But we must notice also the other part of the simile; for the Prophet does not compare the unbelieving to dry branches, but to shrubs, which have roots, and bear the appearance of having some life. Such are the unbelieving, while success, as they say, smiles on them; they think themselves happy, and so they become hardened in their own false counsels, and reject every instruction, and, as though they were freed from the authority of God, they rejected all his prophets. Hence the Prophet, conceding something to them, says, that they were like shrubs, which indeed have roots and leaves, but no fruit, and which also dry up when heat comes. As then the heal; of the sun consumes whatever moisture, beauty, and life, may appear in shrubs, so also God would scorch and dry up the hopes of the unbelieving, though they may think that they have roots to preserve them and their life. A similar declaration is found in <span class="bvs">Psa_129:6</span>, where it is said that the unbelieving are like the grass which grows on the housetops; for such grass appears conspicuous in a high place, while the wheat grows in the low fields, and is even trodden under foot; but that grass, the more elevated it is, the sooner it dries up and perishes without bringing forth any fruit; so also are the unbelieving, who for a time glory and exult over God’s children, and look down on then from their high place, because they are simple and lowly; but as from the corn comes food to us, and that very corn is blessed, so also the elect bring forth fruit in their low and despised condition, while the unfaithful, who occupy elevated stations, vanish away without producing any fruit. It is the same thing that the Prophet means here. These two parts of the comparison ought therefore to be particularly noticed. It follows — </p><p><strong>(173)</strong> It is rendered “a wild <em>tamarisk </em>— <span class="lang el-gr">ἀγριομυρίκη</span><em>,” </em>by <em>the Septuagint; </em>“a tamarisk,” by the <em>Vulgate </em>and the <em>Targum; </em>and “a log,” or <em>“a </em>trunk,” by the <em>Syriac. Gataker </em>considers that no particular tree is meant, but that it means a “solitary” or a “barren” tree, agreeably, in his view, with what is contrasted with it in the 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse. <em>Blayney </em>renders it, “a blasted tree.” of which <em>Horsley </em>approves. The word is a reduplicate of a verb, which means to be bare; and the wild tamarisk may suitably be thus designated, as it bears a very few leaves. The idea of being “blasted” is foreign to the word. </p><p>But <em>Venema </em>contends that the reference is not to any tree, but to a person dwelling in solitude; and he renders the passage thus, — </p><p>And he shall be like the naked in solitude, Nor shall he see when good cometh; And <em>is like him </em>who inhabits parched spots in the desert, A land of salt and not inhabited. </p><p>The words “see” and “inhabit,” appear doubtless more suitable when the passage is thus rendered; yet what is said of the “tree” in verse 8 is equally metaphorical. What seems most agreeable to the whole context is such a rendering as follows: — </p><p>And he shall be like a bare <em>tree </em>in the desert, Which perceives not when good cometh; For it inhabits parched spots in the wilderness, The land of salt and not inhabited. </p><p>It is sometimes the case that it is proper in our language to render the copulative <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> by “which;” not that it properly means that, but the meaning cannot be otherwise seen. The connection here is with the “bare” tree; it is bare, and perceives or knows not widen good comes, for it inhabits parched places. This seems to be the meaning. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
