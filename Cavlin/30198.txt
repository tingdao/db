<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26</strong><em>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches, etc. </em>This clause ought to be carefully noticed; for we here learn that we ought to shun as a deadly poison whatever cannot be enjoyed without offending God; for the <em>pleasures of sin </em>he calls all the allurements of the world which draw us away from God and our calling. But the comforts of our earthly life, which we are allowed by pure conscience, and God’s permission to enjoy, are not included here. Let us then ever remember that we ought to know and understand what God allows us. There are indeed some things in themselves lawful, but the use of which is prohibited to us, owing to circumstances as to time, place, or other things. Hence as to all the blessings connected with the present life, what is ever to be regarded is, that they should be to us helps and aids to follow God and not hindrances. And he calls these pleasures of sin temporary or for <em>a time, </em>because they soon vanish away together with life itself. <span class="cite-ref">(229)</span></p><p>In opposition to these he sets the <em>reproach of Christ, </em>which all the godly ought willingly to undergo. For those whom God has chosen, he has also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his own son; not that he exercises them all by the same kind of reproaches or by the same cross, but that they are all to be so minded as not to decline to undertake the cross in common with Christ. Let every one then bear in mind, that as he is called to this fellowship he is to throw off all hindrances. Nor must we omit to say, that he reckons among the reproaches of Christ all the ignominious trials which the faithful have had to endure from the beginning of the world; for as they were the member of the same body, so they had nothing different from what we have. As all sorrows are indeed the rewards of sin, so they are also the fruits of the curse pronounced on the first man: but whatever wrongs we endure from the ungodly on account of Christ, these he regards as his own. <span class="cite-ref">(230)</span> Hence Paul gloried that he made up what was wanting as to the sufferings of Christ. Were we rightly to consider this, it would not be so grievous and bitter for us to suffer for Christ. </p><p>He also explains more fully what he means in this clause by the <em>reproach of Christ, </em>by what he has previously declared when he said, that Moses chose to<em>suffer affliction with the people of God. </em>He could not have otherwise avowed himself as one of God’s people, except he had made himself a companion to his own nation in their miseries. Since, then, this is the end, let us not separate ourselves from the body of the Church: whatever we suffer, let us know that it is consecrated on account of the head. So on the other hand he calls those things the <em>treasures of Egypt, </em>which no one can otherwise possess than by renouncing and forsaking the Church. </p><p><em>For he had respect unto the recompense of the reward, </em>or for he looked to the remuneration. <span class="cite-ref">(231)</span> He proves by the description he gives, that the magnanimity of Moses’ mind was owing to faith; for he had his eyes fixed on the promise of God. For he could not have hoped that it would be better for him to be with the people of Israel than with the Egyptians, had he not trusted in the promise and in nothing else. </p><p>But if any one hence concludes, that his faith did not recumb on God’s mercy alone, because he had respect to the reward; to this I answer, that the question here is not respecting righteousness or the cause of salvation, but that the Apostle generally includes what belongs to faith. Then faith, as to righteousness before God, does not look on reward, but on the gratuitous goodness of God, not on our works but on Christ alone; but faith, apart from justification, since it extends generally to every word of God, has respect to the reward that is promised; yea, by faith we embrace whatever God promises: but he promises reward to works; then faith lays hold on this. But all this has no place in free justification, for no reward for works can be hoped for, except the imputation of gratuitous justification goes before </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(229)</span> This clause is rendered by Doddridge, “than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin:” by Macknight, “than to have the temporary fruition of sin,” which is literal rendering; so Beza. Schleusner thinks the “sin” to have been that of idolatry: but the words seem rather to refer to the sin of indulgence in vain and demoralizing pursuits, too commonly prevalent in royal courts.— <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(230)</span> The “The reproach of Christ” is differently understood: — </p><p>The reproach of the anointed, that is the people of Israel, called God’s anointed, <span class="bvs">Psa_105:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Heb_3:13</span>. — Grotius. </p><p>The reproach like that of Christ: as Christ, though rich, became poor to redeem mankind, so Moses despised the treasures of Egypt, for the purpose of delivering Israel from bondage. A similar construction is found in <span class="bvs">2Co_1:5</span>. “The sufferings of Christ,” that is, like those of Christ. — Stuart. </p><p>The reproach for Christ, that is, for avowing his expectation of him in common with the distressed people. Macknight, Scott, Bloomfield. For this opinion there is not a particle of evidence from the account we have in Exodus. The Egyptians knew nothing of the redeemer; they therefore could not have reproached the Israelites on his account. </p><p>The reproach of Christ’s people, the word Christ being sometimes taken for his Church, <span class="bvs">1Co_12:12</span>; and this seems to be the view of Calvin. </p><p>The second view is the most satisfactory, and is confirmed by <span class="bvs">Heb_13:13</span>, “bearing his reproach,” that is, a reproach like his. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(231)</span> The words are very striking, “For he looked away,” that is, from difficulties or present trials, “unto the retribution,” the rendering of the recompose. What was the retribution? It was what corresponded with what he did by faith: he engaged by faith in the work of delivering his brethren from bondage. His retribution in this work was, no doubt, then undertaking for his own nation. What his faith in God’s promise enabled him to look to, was the deliverance of his people, which was to be his retribution. In this respect he acted, though in a business infinitely inferior, on the same principle with the Savior, “who for the joy (of redeeming mankind) that was set before him, endured the cross,” etc. <span class="bvs">Heb_12:2</span> — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
