<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Pray ye for the peace of Jerusalem. </em>David now exhorts all the devout worshippers of God to make supplication for the prosperity of the holy city. The more effectually to stir them up to such exercise, he promises that, in this way the divine blessing will descend upon them. The reason why he was so deeply concerned about the prosperity of Jerusalem was, as we have formerly stated — and he again repeats the same thing at the end of the Psalm—because the welfare of the whole Church was inseparably connected with that kingdom and priesthood. Now as each of us in particular, were the whole Church to be involved in ruin, must <em>necessarily </em>perish miserably, it is not surprising to find David <em>recommending to </em>all the children of God to cultivate this anxious concern about the Church. If we would order our prayers aright, let us always begin with pleading that the Lord would be pleased to preserve this sacred community. Whoever<em>, </em>confining his attention to his own personal advantage, is indifferent about the common weal, he not only gives evidence that he is destitute of all true feeling of godliness, but in vain desires his own prosperity, and will profit nothing by his prayers, since he does not observe the due order. <span class="cite-ref">(72)</span> Similar is the drift of the promise which is added immediately after: <em>They shall prosper that love thee; </em>which, however, may be read in the form of a wish, <em>May those who love thee prosper </em>But the sense in either case is almost the same. Farther, although the Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">שלה</span>, <em>shalah, </em>which the Prophet here uses, signifies <em>to live in quietness </em>or <em>peace, </em>yet as the Hebrew noun for <em>peace, </em>from which it is derived, is employed by him generally for a joyful and happy condition, I have no doubt that he here announces in general to all the godly who have the well being of the Church near their heart, that they shall enjoy the blessing of God and a prosperous life. This sentence frequently occurs in the Prophecies of Isaiah, from the 54<span class="cite-ref">th</span> chapter to the end of the book (<span class="bvs">Isa_54:0</span> -66). Hence we learn that the curse of God rests upon all such as afflict the Church, or plot and endeavor by any kind of mischief to accomplish its destruction. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(72)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et ne proufiter arien par ses prieres, d’autant qu’il n’observe point l’ordre legitime</span> ” —<em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
