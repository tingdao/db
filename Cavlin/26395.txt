<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Though I testify concerning myself. </em>Christ replies, that his testimony possesses sufficient credit and authority, because he is not a private person belonging to the great body of men, but holds a very different station. For when he says, that <em>he knoweth whence he came, and whither he goeth, </em>he thus excludes himself from the ordinary rank of men. The meaning therefore is, that every man is heard with suspicion in his own cause, and it is provided by the laws, that no man shall be believed, when he speaks for his own advantage. But this does not apply to the Son of God, who holds a rank above the whole world; for he is not reckoned as belonging to the rank of men, but has received from his Father this privilege, to reduce all men to obedience to him by a single word. </p><p><em>I know whence I came. </em>By these words he declares that his origin is not from the world, but that he proceeded from God, and therefore that it would be unjust and unreasonable that his doctrine, which is Divine, should be subjected to the laws of men. But as he was at that time clothed with the form of a servant, in consequence of which they despised him on account of the mean condition of the flesh, he sends them away to the future glory of his resurrection, from which his Divinity, formerly hidden and unknown, received a clear demonstration. That intermediate condition, therefore, ought not to have prevented the Jews from submitting to God’s only ambassador, who had been formerly promised to them in the Law. </p><p><em>But you know not whence I came, and whither I go. </em>He means that his glory is not at all diminished by their unbelief. Again, as he has given the same testimony to us, our faith ought to despise all the reports and slanders of wicked men; for it cannot be founded upon God without rising far above the loftiest pride of the world. But in order that we may perceive the majesty of his Gospel, we ought always to direct our eyes to the heavenly glory of the Son of God, <span class="cite-ref">(214)</span> and to hear him speaking in the world, so as to remember <em>whence he came</em>, and what authority he now possesses, after having discharged his embassy. For as he humbled himself for a time, so now he is highly exalted <span class="cite-ref">(215)</span> at the right hand of the Father, <em>that every knee may bow to him</em>, (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:10</span>.) </p><p><strong>(214)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Du Fils de Dieu</span>.” </p><p><strong>(215)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Aussi maintenant est-il haut eleve</span>.” </p></div>
