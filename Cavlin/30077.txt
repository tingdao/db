<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>For he of whom these things are spoken, </em>or, <em>said</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(121)</span><em>etc. </em>As the Apostle was speaking to them who confessed Jesus the Son of Mary to be the Christ, he proves that an end was put to the ancient priesthood, because the new Priest, who had been set in the place of the old, was of another tribe, and not of Levi; for according to the Law the honor of the priesthood was to continue, by a special privilege, in that tribe. But he says that it was <em>evident </em>that Christ was born of the tribe of Judah, for it was then a fact commonly known. As then they acknowledged that he was the Christ, it was also necessary that they should be persuaded that he was the son of David; for he who had been promised could derive his origin from no other. </p><p><strong>(121)</strong> Calvin renders “for<span class="lang el-gr">”, γὰρ, </span> “doubtless — certe,” and Stuart, “now;” but it may better be rendered here, “for,” as a reason is given for a change in “the law” respecting the priesthood. The<span class="lang el-gr">γὰρ </span> in the former verse may be rendered “indeed,” or “wherefore” as by Macknight. In the 11<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, the Apostle proves the imperfection or defectiveness of the Levitical priesthood, by the promise of another priest after the order of Melchisedec for Christ was not of the tribe specified by the Law. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
