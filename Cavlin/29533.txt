<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Let the word of Christ dwell. </em>He would have the doctrine of the gospel be familiarly known by them. Hence we may infer by what spirit those are actuated in the present day, who cruelly <span class="cite-ref">(449)</span> interdict the Christian people from making use of it, and furiously vociferate, that no pestilence is more to be dreaded, than that the reading of the Scriptures should be thrown open to the common people. For, unquestionably, Paul here addresses men and women of all ranks; nor would he simply have them take a slight taste merely of the <em>word of Christ</em>, but exhorts that it should <em>dwell in them</em>; that is, that it should have a settled abode, and that <em>largely</em>, that they may make it their aim to advance and increase more and more every day. As, however, the desire of learning is extravagant on the part of many, while they pervert the word of the Lord for their own ambition, or for vain curiosity, or in some way corrupt it, he on this account adds, <em>in all wisdom </em>— that, being instructed by it, we may be wise as we ought to be. </p><p>Farther, he gives a short definition of this wisdom — that the Colossians <em>teach one another Teaching </em>is taken here to mean profitable instruction, which tends to edification, as in <span class="bvs">Rom_12:7</span> — <em>He that teacheth</em>, <em>on teaching</em>; also in Timothy — “All Scripture is profitable for <em>teaching</em>. ” (<span class="bvs">2Ti_3:16</span>.) This is the true use of Christ’s word. As, however, doctrine is sometimes in itself cold, and, as one says, <span class="cite-ref">(450)</span> when it is simply shewn what is right, virtue is praised <span class="cite-ref">(451)</span> and left to starve, <span class="cite-ref">(452)</span> he adds at the same time admonition, which is, as it were, a confirmation of doctrine and incitement to it. Nor does he mean that the <em>word of Christ </em>ought to be of benefit merely to individuals, that they may teach themselves, but he requires mutual teaching and admonition. </p><p><em>Psalms, hymns</em>. He does not restrict the <em>word of Christ </em>to these particular departments, but rather intimates that all our communications should be adapted to edification, that even those which tend to hilarity may have no empty savor. “<em>Leave </em>to unbelievers that foolish delight which they take from ludicrous and frivolous jests and witticisms; <span class="cite-ref">(453)</span> and let your communications, not merely those that are grave, but those also that are joyful and exhilarating, contain something profitable. In place of their obscene, or at least barely modest and <em>decent</em>, songs, it <em>becomes </em>you to make use of hymns and songs that sound forth God’s praise.” Farther, under these three terms he includes all kinds of songs. They are commonly distinguished in this way — that a <em>psalm </em>is that, in the singing of which some musical instrument besides the tongue is made use of: a <em>hymn </em>is properly a song of praise, whether it be sung simply with the voice or otherwise; while an <em>ode </em>contains not merely praises, but exhortations and other matters. He would have the songs of Christians, however, to be <em>spiritual</em>, not made up of frivolities and worthless trifles. For this has a connection with his argument. </p><p>The clause, <em>in grace</em>, Chrysostom explains in different ways. I, however, take it simply, as also afterwards, in <span class="bvs">Col_4:6</span>, where he says, “Let your speech be seasoned with salt, <em>in grace</em>, ” that is, by way of a dexterity that may be agreeable, and may please the hearers by its profitableness, so that it may be opposed to buffoonery and similar trifles. </p><p><em>Singing in your hearts. </em>This relates to disposition; for as we ought to stir up others, so we ought also to sing from the heart, that there may not be merely an external sound with the mouth. At the same time, we must not understand it as though he would have every one sing inwardly to himself, but he would have both conjoined, provided the heart goes before the tongue. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(449)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si estroitement et auec si grande cruaute</span>;” — “So strictly and with such great cruelty.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(450)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme a dit anciennement vn poëte Latin</span>; — “As a Latin poet has anciently said.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(451)</span> “Probitas laudatur et alget;” — “Virtue is praised and starves,” — that is, is slighted.
