<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>O Jehovah my God </em>Here David, to induce God to show him favour, protests that he is molested unjustly, and without being guilty of any crime. To give his protestation the greater weight, he uses an imprecation. If he has done any wrong, he declares his readiness to bear the blame; yea, he offers to endure the severest punishment, if he is not altogether innocent of the crime of which all men thought him almost convicted. And by entreating God to succour him upon no other condition than this, that his integrity should upon trial be found to be untarnished, he teaches us, by his example, that as often as we have recourse to God, we must make it our first care to be well assured in our own consciences with respect to the righteousness of our cause; for we do him great wrong if we wish to engage him as the advocate and defender of a bad cause. The pronoun <em>this </em>shows that he speaks of a thing which was generally known; whence we may conclude, that the slander which had been raised by Cush was spread far and wide. And as David was condemned, by the false reports and unrighteous judgments which men advanced against him, and saw no remedy on earth, he betakes himself to the judgment-seat of God, and contents himself with maintaining his innocence before the heavenly Judge; an example which all the godly should imitate, in order that, in opposition to the slanderous reports which are spread against them, they may rest satisfied with the judgment of God alone. He next declares more distinctly, that he had committed no crime. And in the fourth verse, he mentions two particulars in self-vindication; first, That he had done no wrong to any one; and, secondly, That he had rather endeavoured to do good to his enemies, by whom notwithstanding he had been injured without any just cause. I, therefore, explain the fourth verse thus: If I have wronged any man that was at peace with me, and have not rather succoured the unworthy, who persecuted me without a cause, etc. Since David was hated of almost all men, as if ambition to reign had impelled him perfidiously to rise up in rebellion against Saul, and to lay snares for the monarch to whom he was bound by the oath of allegiances <span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> in the first part of the verse, he clears himself of such a foul slander. The reason, perhaps, why he calls Saul <em>him that was at peace with him </em>is, that on account of his royal dignity his person ought to be sacred, and secure from danger, <span class="cite-ref">(102)</span> so that it should be unlawful to make any hostile attempt against him. This phrase, however, may be understood generally, as if he had said, No one who has meekly restrained himself from injuring me, and has conducted himself kindly towards me, can with truth complain that I have ever injured him in a single instance. And yet it was the general persuasion, that David, in the midst of peace, had stirred up great confusion, and caused war. From this it is just so much the more manifest, that David, provided he enjoyed the approbation of God, was contented with the consolation arising from this, though he should have comfort from no other source. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Apres luy avoir fait le serment</span>.”—<em>Fr</em>. “After having sworn the oath of allegiance to him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(102)</span><em>“ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Pource que le nom et titre royal luy devoit estre une sauvegarde et le tenir en seurete</span>.”—<em>Fr. “ </em>Because the royal name and title ought to be to him a safeguard, and secure the safety of his person.” </p></div></div>
