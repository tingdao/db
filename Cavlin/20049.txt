<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah uses now a form of speaking very common in the Prophets though remote from common use. For the Prophets, when they denounce God’s judgments and punishments on the ungodly, do not speak in a simple language, as though they were giving a narrative, but they employed figurative expressions, as though they wished to introduce men into the very scene itself. And that their doctrine might more effectually penetrate into the hearts of men, they bring forward various persons; they at one time introduce God as speaking, and at another they pronounce this or that according to the sentiments of others; and again, they declare the commands of God. </p><p>Jeremiah begins here by summoning the Egyptians, as though he were the herald of Pharaoh, and thus borrows the name of another person. He says, <em>Prepare </em>The verb <span class="lang he-il">ערך</span><em>, orec, </em>properly means to set in order, but here it signifies to prepare; <em>Prepare, </em>then, <em>the buckler and the shield </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">צנה</span>, <em>tsane, </em>was a shield of a larger form, and <span class="lang he-il">מגן</span>, <em>megen, </em>seems to have been a buckler carried by horsemen of light armor. <em>And come near to battle</em>: He then adds, <em>Bind </em>or he <em>the horses </em>The manner of fighting is not the same now as it was formerly; they fought in chariots, as heathen authors abundantly shew. He therefore says, he<em>the horses, </em>that is, join them together that they may draw the chariots. <em>Go up, ye horsemen, stand in your helmets, clean your lances, and put on your coats of mail. </em>The meaning is, that Egyptians would come well prepared with all kinds of arms that they might be formidable to their enemies. And hence the vengeance appeared more clearly, because they had been well furnished, so that they might seem to have gained the victory before they engaged with their enemies. This is the reason why the Prophet enumerates their complete armor, having omitted no material part; he mentions <em>the lances, the helmets, the coats of mail, the chariots, the horses, </em>and <em>the shield, </em>so that victory, according to the judgment of men, was already theirs. This is the first thing. </p><p>But we must observe the design of the Holy Spirit; it was his purpose to remove the veil from the eyes of the faithful, which for the most part prevents us to see as clearly as we ought the power of God; for when we fix our attention on warlike preparations, we do not think that anything is left for God to do; for they who are well prepared seem to be beyond the hazard of losing the day. That the Jews then might know that it would be nothing for God to punish the Egyptians, he records this preparation. And there is a kind of concession when he says, They shall indeed be furnished with a helmet, a coat of mail, a shield, a sword, and a lance; but all this would avail nothing as to the issue. Then from this prophetic word let us learn, that God makes no account of all those things which men prepare when they wish to <em>effect </em>anything. For smoke is everything that dazzles our eyes; so forces and arms have no importance before God; for by a single blast he can dissipate all such clouds. And this truth is very useful; for we look on external things, and when anything specious presents itself to us, we are immediately taken up with it, and rob God of all power; for we transfer his glory to these masks which appear before us. We now then understand why the Prophet speaks here of bucklers, and shields, and lances, and chariots, and helmets, and coats of mail. </p></div>
