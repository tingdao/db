<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14</strong><em>And at evening they shall return </em>It is of no consequence whether we read the words in the future tense or in the subjunctive, understanding it to be a continuance of the preceding prayer. But it seems more probable that David, after having brought his requests to a close, anticipates the happy issue which he desired. And he makes an apt allusion to what he had already said of their insatiable hunger. The words which he had formerly used he repeats, but with a different application, ironically declaring that they would be ravenous in another sense, and that matters would issue otherwise than they had looked for. Above he had complained that they made a noise like dogs, adverting to the eagerness and fierceness with which they were bent upon mischief; now he derides their malicious efforts, and says, that after wearying themselves with their endless pursuit all day, they would go disappointed of their purpose. He uses no longer the language of complaint, but congratulates himself upon the abortive issue of their activity. The Hebrew word which I have translated, <em>if not, </em>in the close of the fifteenth verse, is by some considered to be the form of an oath. But this is an over-refined interpretation. Others would have the negation repeated, reading, <em>if they shall not have been satisfied, neither shall they lodge for the night </em>But this also is far-fetched. The simple and true meaning suggests itself at once, that, although they might not be satisfied, they would be forced to lay themselves down, and the misery of their hunger would be aggravated, by the circumstance that they had passed the whole day in fruitless application, and must lie down for the night empty, wearied, and unsatisfied. <span class="cite-ref">(375)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(375)</span> Street translates, “If they be not satisfied, they spend the night in howling;” and observes, that there seems to be a word lost after the original verb <span class="lang he-il">לון</span>, <em>lun</em>, which he renders, <em>they spend the night</em>; and he supplies h; by the words, <em>in howling </em>The meaning of the verb <span class="lang he-il">לום</span>, <em>lun</em>, is ambiguous. It signifies both <em>to continue all night</em>, and <em>to growl</em>, or <em>murmur </em>Either sense will be appropriate in this passage. The Chaldee and Syriac understand it in the former sense; and the Septuagint in the latter. </p></div></div>
