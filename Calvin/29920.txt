<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>Teaching us that, denying, ungodliness </em>He now lays down the rule for regulating our life well, and how we ought to begin, namely, with renouncing our former life, of which he enumerates two parts, “ungodliness and worldly desires.” Under <em>ungodliness, </em>I include not only superstitions, in which they had gone astray, but irreligious contempt of God, such as reigns in men, till they have been enlightened in the knowledge of the truth. Although they have some profession of religion, yet they never fear and reverence God sincerely and honestly, but, on the contrary, have consciences that are useless, so that nothing is further from their thoughts than that they ought to serve God. <span class="cite-ref">(250)</span></p><p>By <em>worldly desires </em><span class="cite-ref">(251)</span> he means all the affections of the flesh; because we look at nothing but the world, till the Lord has drawn us to himself. Meditation on the heavenly life begins with regeneration. Before we have been regenerated, our desires lean towards the world, and rest on the world. </p><p><em>That we may live temperately, and righteously, and piously </em>As he formerly mentioned those three, when he wished to give a comprehensive summary of Christian life, so he now makes it to consist of those three, “piety, righteousness, and temperance.” “Piety” is religion towards God. “Righteousness” has place among men. He who is endowed with both of these lacks nothing for perfect virtue; and, indeed, in the law of God there is absolute perfection, to which nothing whatever can be added. But as the exercises of godliness may be regarded as appendages to the first table, so “temperance,” which Paul mentions in this passage, aims at nothing else than keeping the law, and, as I said before about <em>patience, </em><span class="cite-ref">(252)</span> is added to the former as a seasoning. Nor does the Apostle contradict himself, when at one time he describes patience, and at another time temperance, as the perfection of a holy life; for they are not distinct virtues, since<span class="lang el-gr">σωφροσύνη </span> (here translated temperance) includes patience under it. </p><p>He adds, <em>in this world, </em><span class="cite-ref">(253)</span> because the Lord has appointed the present life for the trial of our faith. Although the fruit of good actions is not yet visible, yet the hope should be sufficient for stimulating us to doing well; and this is what he immediately adds, — </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(250)</span> “It presents us with the strongest motives to obedience. ‘The grace of God teacheth us to deny ungodliness.’ What chains bind faster and closer than love? Here is love to our nature in his incarnation, love to us, though enemies, in his death and passion: encouragements to obedience by the proffers of pardon for former rebellions. By the disobedience of man God introduces his redeeming grace, and engages his creature to more ingenuous and excellent returns than his innocent state could oblige him to. In his created state he had goodness to move him, he hath the same goodness now to oblige him as a creature, and a greater love and mercy to oblige him as a repaired creature; and the terror of justice is taken off, which might envenom his heart as a criminal. In his revolted state he had misery to discourage him; in his redeemed state he hath love to attract him. Without such a way, black despair had seized upon the creature exposed to a remediless misery, and God would have had no returns of love from the best of his earthly works; but if any sparks of ingenuity be left, they will be excited by the efficacy of this argument.” — <em>Charnock. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(251)</span> “On the expression<span class="lang el-gr">τὰς κοσμικὰς ἐπιθυμίας, </span> the best comment is <span class="bvs">1Jo_2:16</span><span class="lang el-gr">Σωφρόνως </span> denotes virtue as regards ourselves<span class="lang el-gr">; δικαίως, </span> as regards our fellow-creatures; and<span class="lang el-gr">εὐσεβῶς, </span> as respects God.
