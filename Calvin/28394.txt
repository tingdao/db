<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>He that glorieth let him glory in the Lord </em>Mark the end that God has in view in bestowing all things upon us in Christ — that we may not claim any merit to ourselves, but may give him all the praise. For God does not despoil with the view of leaving us bare, but forthwith clothes us with his glory — yet on this condition, that whenever we would glory we must go out of ourselves. In short, man, brought to nothing in his own estimation, and acknowledging that there is nothing good anywhere but in God alone, must renounce all desire for his own glory, and with all his might aspire and aim at the glory of God exclusively. This is also more clearly apparent from the context in the writings of the Prophet, from whom Paul has borrowed this testimony; for in that passage the Lord, after stripping all mankind of glory in respect of strength, wisdom, and riches, commands us to glory only <em>in knowing him</em>, (<span class="bvs">Jer_9:23</span>.) Now he would have us know him in such a way as to <em>know </em>that it is <em>he that exercises judgment, righteousness, and mercy </em>For this knowledge produces in us at once confidence in him and fear of him. If therefore a man has his mind regulated in such a manner that, claiming no merit to himself, he desires that God alone be exalted; if he rests with satisfaction on his grace, and places his entire happiness in his fatherly love, and, in fine, is satisfied with God alone, that man <em>truly </em>“glories in the Lord.” I say <em>truly</em>, for even hypocrites on false grounds glory in him, as Paul declares, (<span class="bvs">Rom_2:17</span>,) when being either puffed up with his gifts, or elated with a base confidence in the flesh, or abusing his word, they nevertheless take his name upon them. </p></div>
