<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And the child shall play on the hole of the asp. </em>He continues to illustrate the same sentiment, that when men have been brought into a state of favor with God, and have been cleansed from their depravity by the Spirit of regeneration, they will likewise be free from every hurtful disposition. There is no reason why men dread the danger or poison arising from the bite of serpents, but because they do not deserve that God should place every part of the world under their control. And, indeed, since animals are permitted to do injury even to <em>children</em>, this shows that the whole race of Adam has been stained with pollution from the very womb. </p><p>We must again observe the comparison which we stated, that those men whom a concealed poison led to deeds of violence will have their disposition changed, and will do no harm even to <em>little children</em>. Some men are openly fierce and cruel, (<span class="bvs">Psa_140:3</span>,) and others inwardly carry and cherish their malice like poison, (<span class="bvs">Psa_55:21</span>,) as David also describes them; for some men are more quick, and others are more slow, to manifest the desire of doing injury. Whatever they may have formerly been, he means that all of them must be cleansed from wickedness, both open and concealed, after having submitted to Christ. He means, also, that henceforth safety, which will reign everywhere, will be enjoyed even by those who have no kind of protection; so that they will freely venture to expose themselves to imminent dangers. </p></div>
