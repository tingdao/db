<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Thy adversaries have roared in the midst of thy sanctuaries. </em>Here the people of God compare their enemies to lions, (<span class="bvs">Amo_3:8</span>,) to point out the cruelty which they exercised even in the very sanctuaries of God. <span class="cite-ref">(218)</span> In this passage we are to understand the temple of Jerusalem as spoken of rather than the Jewish synagogues; nor is it any objection to this interpretation that the temple is here called in the plural number <em>sanctuaries, </em>as is frequently the case in other places, it being so called because it was divided into three parts. If any, however, think it preferable to consider synagogues as intended, I would not dispute the point. Yea, without any impropriety, it may be extended to the whole land, which God had consecrated to himself. But the language is much more emphatic when we consider the temple as meant. It thus intimates, that the rage of the enemy was so unbounded and indiscriminate that they did not even spare the temple of God. When it is said, <em>They have set up their signs, </em><span class="cite-ref">(219)</span> this serves to show their insulting and contemptuous conduct, that in erecting their standards they proudly triumphed even over God himself. Some explain this of magical divinations, <span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> even as Ezekiel testifies, (<span class="bvs">Eze_21:21</span>,) that Nebuchadnezzar sought counsel from the flight and the voice of birds; but this sense is too restricted. The explanation which I have given may be viewed as very suitable. Whoever entered into the Holy Land knew that the worship of God which flourished there was of a special character, and different from that which was performed in any other part of the world: <span class="cite-ref">(221)</span> the temple was a token of the presence of God, and by it he seemed, as if with banners displayed, to hold that people under his authority and dominion. With these symbols, which distinguished the chosen tribes from the heathen nations, the prophet here contrasts the sacrilegious standards which their enemies had brought into the temple. <span class="cite-ref">(222)</span> By repeating the word <em>signs </em>twice, he means to aggravate the abominable nature of their act; for having thrown down the tokens and ensigns of the true service of God, they set up in their stead strange symbols. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(218)</span> Instead of songs of praise and other acts of devotion, nothing was now heard in the Jewish places of worship but profane vociferation, and the tumultuous noise of a heathen army. This is with great beauty and effect compared to the roaring of a lion. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(219)</span> Hammond reads, “They set up their ensigns for trophies.” The original word both for <em>ensigns </em>and <em>trophies </em>is <span class="lang he-il">אות</span>, <em>oth </em>But he observes that it requires here to be differently translated. <span class="lang he-il">אות</span>, <em>oth</em>, signifies a <em>sign</em>, and thence <em>a military standard </em>or <em>ensign </em>The setting up of this in any place which has been taken by arms, is a token or sign of the victory achieved; and, accordingly, an ensign or standard thus set up becomes <em>a trophy </em>To convey, therefore, the distinctive meaning, he contends that it is necessary in this passage to give different renderings to the same word. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(220)</span> That is, they understand <em>signs </em>to mean such <em>signs </em>as diviners or soothsayers were wont to give, by which to foretell things to come. Jarchi, who adopts this interpretation, gives this sense: That the enemies of God’s people having completed their conquest according to the auspices or signs of soothsayers, were fully convinced that these signs were real signs; in other words, that the art of divination was true. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(221)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il y avoit un service divine special et different de ce qui se faisoit ailleurs</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(222)</span> “<em>Their own symbols they have set for signs</em>. Profane representations, no doubt, agreeable to their own worship. See <span class="bvs">1Ma_1:47</span>.” — <em>Dr Geddes</em>. </p></div></div>
