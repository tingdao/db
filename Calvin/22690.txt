<div class="comment-content"><p>Nahum continues still on the same subject, — that when God ascended his tribunal and appeared as the Judge of the world, he would not only shake all the elements, but would also constrain them to change their nature. For what can be less consonant to nature than for mountains to tremble, and for hills to be dissolved or to melt? This is more strange than what we can comprehend. But the Prophet intimates that the mountains cannot continue in their own strength, but as far as they are sustained by the favor of God. As soon, then, as God is angry, the mountains melt like snow, and flow away like water. And all these things are to be applied to this purpose, and are designed for this end, — that the wicked might not daringly despise the threatening of God, nor think that they could, through his forbearance, escape the punishment which they deserved: for he will be their Judge, however he may spare them; and though God is ready to pardon, whenever men hate themselves on account of their sins, and seriously repent; he will be yet irreconcilable to all the reprobate and the perverse. <em>The mountains, </em>then, <em>before him tremble, and the hills dissolve </em>or melt. </p><p>This useful instruction may be gathered from these words, that the world cannot for a moment stand, except as it is sustained by the favor and goodness of God; for we see what would immediately be, as soon as God manifests the signals of his judgment. Since the very solidity of mountains would be as snow or wax, what would become of miserable men, who are like a shadow or an apparition? They would then vanish away as soon as God manifested his wrath against them, as it is so in <span class="bvs">Psa_39:0</span>, that men pass away like a shadow. This comparison ought ever to be remembered by us whenever a forgetfulness of God begins to creep over us, that we may not excite his wrath by self-complacencies, than which there is nothing more pernicious. <em>Burned, </em><span class="cite-ref">(212)</span><em>then shall be the earth, and the world, and all who dwell on it </em></p><p><strong>(212)</strong> This sense has been given to the verb by the Rabbins, which is inconsistent with it as found here without any variations, and with the Greek versions. <span class="lang he-il">תשא</span> is either from <span class="lang he-il">נשא</span>, to lift up, or from <span class="lang he-il">שאה</span>, to be laid waste, or to be confounded, the final <span class="lang he-il">ה</span> being dropped; and this is what <em>Newcome </em>adopts. <em>Marckius </em>and <em>Henderson </em>take the former meaning in the sense of being raised up or heaving. “<span class="lang el-gr">Ανεσταλη</span>, was removed,” <em>Sept.; </em>“<span class="lang el-gr">Εκινηθη</span>, was moved,” <em>Symmachus; </em>“<span class="lang el-gr">Εφριξεν</span>, trembled,” <em>Aquila. </em>The idea of being confounded or laid waste harmonizes best with all parts of the sentence; for the idea of having does not apply well to the inhabitants. We see here that all the Greek versions have the verb in the past tense; and so are the previous verbs in the verse as given in the Septuagint, and agreeably with the Hebrew. </p><p>Mountains have shaken through him, <LineBreak />And hills have melted away; <LineBreak />And confounded has been the earth at his presence, <LineBreak />Yea, the world and all its inhabitants. </p></div>
