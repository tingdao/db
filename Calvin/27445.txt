<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Being brought on the way by the Church. </em>Whereas, by the common consent of the Church, there were joined to Paul and Barnabas companions, who might, for duty’s sake, conduct them, we may thereby gather, that all the godly were on their side; and that they did never otherwise think but that the cause was theirs as well as the apostles. Wherefore they determined the journey of Paul and Barnabas with like minds as they took it in hand; to wit, that they might tame and put to silence those troublesome spirits who did falsely make boast of the apostles. Whereas he saith shortly after, that they certified the brethren in their voyage of the wonderful conversion of the Gentiles, it is a testimony and token that they came not to Jerusalem fraught with fear; but that they did even without fear stoutly profess that which they had taught before. Therefore, they come not to plead their cause before their judges; but that they may, with common consent and judgment, on both sides, approve that which was commanded by God touching the abolishing of ceremonies. For though they did not despise the judgment of the apostles, yet because they knew that it was not lawful for them, neither for the apostles, to decree otherwise concerning the cause, it did not become them to stand as men whose matter is handled at the bar.<span class="cite-ref">(87)</span> Thence cometh the boldness of rejoicing; to this end<span class="cite-ref">(88)</span> tendeth the joy of the godly, whereby they subscribe both to the doctrine of Paul and also the calling of the Gentiles.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(87)</span></p><p>“ Reos,” as men accused, defenders. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(88)</span></p><p>“ Huc accedit,” to this is added. </p></div></div>
