<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>He groaned in his spirit. </em>If Christ had not been excited to compassion by their tears, he would rather have kept his countenance unmoved, but when, of his own accord, he conforms to those mourners, so far as to weep along with them, <span class="cite-ref">(323)</span> he gives proof that he has sympathy, (<span class="lang el-gr">συμπάθεια</span>.) For the cause of this feeling is, in my opinion, expressed by the Evangelist, when he says that <em>Christ saw Mary and the rest weeping </em>Yet I have no doubt that Christ contemplated something higher, namely, the general misery of the whole human race; for he knew well what had been enjoined on him by the Father, and why he was sent into the world, namely, to free us from all evils. As he has actually done this, so he intended to show that he accomplished it with warmth and earnestness. Accordingly, when he is about to raise Lazarus, before granting deliverance or aid, by <em>the groaning of his spirit</em>, by a strong feeling of grief, and by <em>tears</em>, he shows that he is as much affected by our distresses as if he had endured them in his own person. </p><p>But how do <em>groaning </em>and<em>trouble of mind </em>belong to the person of the Son of God? As some reckon it absurd to say that Christ, as one of the number of human beings, was subject to human passions, they think that the only way in which he experienced grief or joy was, that he received in himself those feelings, whenever he thought proper, by some secret dispensation. It is in this sense, Augustine thinks, that the Evangelist says that <em>he was troubled, </em>because other men are hurried along by their feelings, which exercise dominion, or rather tyranny, to <em>trouble </em>their minds. He considers the meaning therefore to be, that Christ, though otherwise tranquil and free from all passion, brought <em>groaning </em>and <em>grief </em>upon himself of his own accord. But this simplicity will, in my opinion, be more agreeable to Scripture, if we say that the Son of God, having clothed himself with our flesh, of his own accord clothed himself also with human feelings, so that he did not differ at all from his brethren, sin only excepted. In this way we detract nothing from the glory of Christ, when we say that it was a voluntary submission, by which he was brought to resemble us in the feelings of the soul. Besides, as he submitted from the very commencement, we must not imagine that he was free and exempt from those feelings; and in this respect he proved himself to be our brother, in order to assure us, that we have a Mediator, who willingly pardons our infirmities, and who is ready to assist those infirmities which he has experienced in himself. </p><p>It will perhaps be objected, that the passions of men are sinful, and therefore it cannot be admitted that we have them in common with the Son of God. I reply, there is a wide difference between Christ and us. For the reason why our feelings are sinful is, that they rush on without restraint, and suffer no limit; but in Christ the feelings were adjusted and regulated in obedience to God, and were altogether free from sin. To express it more fully, <span class="cite-ref">(324)</span> the feelings of men are sinful and perverse on two accounts; first, because they are hurried along by impetuous motion, and are not regulated by the true rule of modesty; and, secondly, because they do not always arise from a lawful cause, or, at least, are not directed to a lawful end. I say that there is excess, because no person rejoices or grieves, so far only as is sufficient, or as God permits, and there are even some who shake themselves loose from all restraint. The vanity of our understanding brings us grief or sadness, on account of trifles, or for no reason whatever, because we are too much devoted to the world. Nothing of this nature was to be found in Christ; for he had no passion or affection of his own that ever went beyond its proper bounds; he had not one that was not proper, and founded on reason and sound judgment. </p><p>To make this matter still more clear, it will be of importance for us to distinguish between man’s first nature, as it was created by God, and this degenerate nature, which is corrupted by sin. When God created man, he implanted affections in him, but affections which were obedient and submissive to reason. That those affections are now disorderly and rebellious is an accidental fault; that is, it proceeds from some other cause than from the Creator. <span class="cite-ref">(325)</span> Now Christ took upon him human affections, but without (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀταξία</span>) disorder; for he who obeys the passions of the flesh is not obedient to God. Christ was indeed <em>troubled </em>and vehemently agitated; but, at the same time, he kept himself in subjection to the will of the Father. In short, if you compare his passions with ours, they will differ not less than pure and clear water, flowing in a gentle course, differs from dirty and muddy foam. </p><p>The example of Christ ought to be sufficient of itself for setting aside the unbending sternness which the Stoics demand; for whence ought we to look for the rule of supreme perfection but from Christ? We ought rather to endeavor to correct and subdue that obstinacy which pervades our affections on account of the sin of Adam, and, in so doing, to follow Christ as our leader, that he may bring us into subjection. Thus Paul does not demand from us hardened stupidity, but enjoins us to observe moderation </p><p>in our mourning, that we may not abandon ourselves to grief, like unbelievers who have no hope <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Th_4:13</span>;) </p><p>for even Christ took our affections into himself, that by his power we may subdue every thing in them that is sinful. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(323)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand de son bon gre il se conforme a ces pleurans, jusques pleurer avec eux</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(324)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour mieux dire</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(325)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, venant d’ailleurs que du Createur</span>.” </p></div></div>
