<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Command the priests, </em>etc Here it is shown more clearly how meekly and calmly the priests yielded implicit obedience to the divine command, for they did not move a foot until Joshua ordered the signal to retire. But as it was an instance of rare virtue to be thus modest and obedient, so the fatherly kindness of God is conspicuous in this, that he condescended to direct and govern almost every step in their progress by his own voice, lest any perplexity might occur to retard them. </p><p>Next follows a more conspicuous confirmation of the miracle; for as soon as they climbed the opposite bank, the Jordan began again to flow as usual. Had it not returned to its former state, and indeed, suddenly, many would have imagined the cause of the change to be hidden but fortuitous. But when God displays his power and favor at minute intervals of time all doubt is removed. The moment the feet of the priests were made wet the Jordan retired; now on their departure he recovers his free course, and that at the very instant when they reached the bank. For the term <em>dry </em>here means that part which was not covered by the overflow. <span class="cite-ref">(52)</span> Thus the river, though dumb, <span class="cite-ref">(53)</span> was the best of heralds, proclaiming with a loud voice that heaven and earth are subject to the God of Israel. </p><p><strong>(52)</strong> Calvin, still adhering to the view that part of the plain beyond the immediate bank was overflowed, seems to think that the priests, after climbing up the steep bank, continued to walk for some time among the shallow water. The other view which supposes that the banks were only filled and not overflowed, besides being more in accordance with the original, as was formerly shown, appears to derive additional confirmation from the language here used. It is said the waters returned the moment the priests touched the dry ground with the <em>soles </em>of their feet; in other words, so long as they were climbing up the steep bank, and, of course, had no firm footing, the heap of waters continued, but it was immediately dissolved as soon as they could set down their foot firmly in consequence of having reached the flat. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(53)</strong> “Dumb.” Latin, “mutus.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">une creature insensible et sans voix</span>;” “An inanimate creature without voice.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
