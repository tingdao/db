<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>In the beginning was the Speech</em>. In this introduction he asserts the eternal Divinity of Christ, in order to inform us that he is the eternal God, who <em>was manifested in the flesh</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:16</span>.) The design is, to show it to have been necessary that the restoration of mankind should be accomplished by the Son of God, since by his power all things were created, since he alone breathes into all the creatures life and energy, so that they remain in their condition; and since in man himself he has given a remarkable display both of his power and of his grace, and even subsequently to the fall of man has not ceased to show liberality and kindness towards his posterity. And this doctrine is highly necessary to be known; for since apart from God we ought not at all to seek life and salvation, how could our faith rest on Christ, if we did not know with certainty what is here taught? By these words, therefore, the Evangelist assures us that we do not withdraw from the only and eternal God, when we believe in Christ, and likewise that life is now restored to the dead through the kindness of him who was the source and cause of life, when the nature of man was still uncorrupted. </p><p>As to the Evangelist calling the Son of God <em>the Speech</em>, the simple reason appears to me to be, first, because he is the eternal Wisdom and Will of God; and, secondly, because he is the lively image of His purpose; for, as <em>Speech </em>is said to be among men the image of the mind, so it is not inappropriate to apply this to God, and to say that He reveals himself to us by his <em>Speech</em>. The other significations of the Greek word <span class="lang el-gr">λόγος</span> (Logos) do not apply so well. It means, no doubt, <em>definition</em>, and <em>reasoning</em>, and <em>calculation</em>; but I am unwilling to carry the abstruseness of philosophy beyond the measure of my faith. And we perceive that the Spirit of God is so far from approving of such subtleties that, in prattling with us, by his very silence he cries aloud with what sobriety we ought to handle such lofty mysteries. </p><p>Now as God, in creating the world, revealed himself by that <em>Speech</em>, so he formerly had him concealed with himself, so that there is a twofold relation; the former to God, and the latter to men. Servetus, a haughty scoundrel belonging to the Spanish nation, invents the statement, that this eternal <em>Speech </em>began to exist at that time when he was displayed in the creation of the world, as if he did not exist before his power was made known by external operation. Very differently does the Evangelist teach in this passage; for he does not ascribe to <em>the Speech </em>a <em>beginning </em>of time, but says that he was <em>from the beginning</em>, and thus rises beyond all ages. I am fully aware how this dog barks against us, and what cavils were formerly raised by the Arians, namely, that </p><p>in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Gen_1:1</span>) </p><p>which nevertheless are not eternal, because the word <em>beginning </em>refers to order, instead of denoting eternity. But the Evangelist meets this calumny when he says, </p><p><em>And the Speech was with God. </em>If <em>the Speech </em>began to be at some time, they must find out some succession of time in God; and undoubtedly by this clause John intended to distinguish him from all created things. For many questions might arise, Where was this <em>Speech </em>? How did he exert his power? What was his nature? How might he be known? The Evangelist, therefore, declares that we must not confine our views to the world and to created things; for he was always united to God, before the world existed. Now when men date <em>the beginning </em>from the origin of heaven and earth, do they not reduce Christ to the common order of the world, from which he is excluded in express terms by this passage? By this proceeding they offer an egregious insult not only to the Son of God, but to his eternal Father, whom they deprive of his wisdom. If we are not at liberty to conceive of God without his <em>wisdom</em>, it must be acknowledged that we ought not to seek the origin of <em>the Speech </em>any where else than in the Eternal Wisdom of God. </p><p>Servetus objects that <em>the Speech </em>cannot be admitted to have existed any earlier than when Moses introduces God as speaking. As if he did not subsist in God, because he was not publicly made known: that is, as if he did not exist <em>within</em>, until he began to appear <em>without</em>. But every pretense for outrageously absurd fancies of this description is cut off by the Evangelist, when he affirms without reservation, that <em>the Speech was with God</em>; for he expressly withdraws us from every moment of time. </p><p>Those who infer from the imperfect tense of the verb <span class="cite-ref">(9)</span> which is here used, that it denotes continued existence, have little strength of argument to support them. <em>Was</em>, they say, is a word more fitted to express the idea of uninterrupted succession, than if John had said, <em>Has been</em>. But on matters so weighty we ought to employ more solid arguments; and, indeed, the argument which I have brought forward ought to be reckoned by us sufficient; namely, that the Evangelist sends us to the eternal secrets of God, that we may there learn that <em>the Speech </em>was, as it were hidden, before he revealed himself in the external structure of the world. Justly, therefore, does Augustine remark, that this <em>beginning</em>, which is now mentioned, has no <em>beginning</em>; for though, in the order of nature, the Father came before his <em>Wisdom</em>, yet those who conceive of any point of time when he went before his <em>Wisdom</em>, deprive Him of his glory. And this is the eternal generation, which, during a period of infinite extent before the foundation of the world, lay hid in God, so to speak — which, for a long succession of years, was obscurely shadowed out to the Fathers under the Law, and at length was more fully manifested in flesh. </p><p>I wonder what induced the Latins to render <span class="lang el-gr">ὁ λόγος</span> by <em>Verbum</em>, (the Word;) for that would rather have been the translation of <span class="lang el-gr">τὸ ῥη̑μα.</span> But granting that they had some plausible reason, still it cannot be denied that <em>Sermo </em>(<em>the Speech</em>) would have been far more appropriate. Hence it is evident, what barbarous tyranny was exercised by the theologians of the Sorbonne, <span class="cite-ref">(10)</span> who teased and stormed at Erasmus in such a manner, because he had changed a single word for the better. </p><p><em>And the Speech was with God</em>. We have already said that <em>the Son of God </em>is thus placed above the world and above all the creatures, and is declared to have existed before all ages. But at the same time this mode of expression attributes to him a distinct personality from the Father; for it would have been absurd in the Evangelist to say that <em>the Speech was </em>always <em>with God</em>, if he had not some kind of subsistence peculiar to himself in God. This passage serves, therefore, to refute the error of Sabellius; for it shows that the Son is distinct from the Father. I have already remarked that we ought to be sober in thinking, and modest in speaking, about such high mysteries. And yet the ancient writers of the Church were excusable, when, finding that they could not in any other way maintain sound and pure doctrine in opposition to the perplexed and ambiguous phraseology of the heretics, they were compelled to invent some words, which after all had no other meaning than what is taught in the Scriptures. They said that there are three Hypostases, or Subsistences, or Persons, in the one and simple essence of God. The word; <span class="lang el-gr">ὑπόστασις</span> (Hypostasis) occurs in this sense in <span class="bvs">Heb_1:3</span>, to which corresponds the Latin word <em>Substaatia</em>, (<em>substance</em>) as it is employed by Hilary. The Persons (<span class="lang el-gr">τὰ πρόσωπα</span>) were called by them distinct properties in God, which present themselves to the view of our minds; as Gregory Nazianzen says, “I cannot think of the One (God) without having the Three (Persons) shining around me. <span class="cite-ref">(11)</span></p><p><em>And the Speech was God</em>. That there may be no remaining doubt as to Christ’s divine essence, the Evangelist distinctly asserts that <em>he is God</em>. Now since there is but one God, it follows that Christ is of the same essence with the Father, and yet that, in some respect, he is distinct from the Father. But of the second clause we have already spoken. As to the unity of the divine essence, Arius showed prodigious wickedness, when, to avoid being compelled to acknowledge the eternal Divinity of Christ, he prattled about I know not what imaginary Deity; <span class="cite-ref">(12)</span> but for our part, when we are informed that <em>the Speech was God</em>, what right have we any longer to call in question his eternal essence? </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(9)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource qu’il est dit Estoit, et non pas N’este</span>;” — “Because it is said <em>Was</em>, and not <em>Has been</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(10)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les Theologiens Sorbonistes</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(11)</span> The reader will find our Author’s views of the Holy Trinity very fully illustrated in the <em>Institutes of the Christian Religion</em>, Book I. Chap. 13., and will be at a loss whether to admire most the marvelous acuteness, or the sobriety of judgment, by which the whole discussion is pervaded. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(12)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que c’estoit je ne scay quel Dieu qui avoit este cree, et eu commencement</span>;”— “That there was I know not what God who had been created, and had a beginning.” </p></div></div>
