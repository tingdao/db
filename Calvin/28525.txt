<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>Therefore he that giveth in marriage. </em>Here we have the conclusion from both parts of the statement, in which he states, in a few words, that parents are free from blame if they give away their daughters in marriage, while he at the same time declares that <em>they do better </em>if they keep them at home unmarried. You are not, however, to understand that celibacy is here preferred to marriage, otherwise than under the exception which was a little before expressed. For if power be wanting on the part of the daughter, <span class="cite-ref">(451)</span> the father acts an exceedingly bad part if he endeavors to keep her back from marriage, and would be no longer a father to her, but a cruel tyrant. The sum of the whole discussion amounts to this — that celibacy is better than marriage, because it has more liberty, so that persons can serve God with greater freedom; but at the same time, that no necessity ought to be imposed, so as to make it unlawful for individuals to marry, if they think proper; and farther, that marriage itself is a remedy appointed by God for our infirmity, <span class="cite-ref">(452)</span> which all ought to use that are not endowed with the gift of continency. Every person of sound judgment will join with me in acknowledging and confessing, that the whole of Paul’s doctrine on this point is comprehended in these <em>three </em>articles. </p><p><strong>(451)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car quand la puissance defaudra a la fille de s’abstenir de mariage</span>;” — “For when the daughter has not power to abstain from marriage.” </p><p><strong>(452)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour subuenir a nostre infirmite</span>;” — “To help our infirmity.” </p></div>
