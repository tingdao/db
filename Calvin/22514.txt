<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet now laughs to scorn the Idumeans, because they relied on their own fortresses, and thought themselves, according to the common saying, to be beyond the reach of darts; and hence they petulantly insulted the Israelites and despised God himself. The Prophet therefore says, that the Idumeans in vain felicitated themselves, for he shows that all they promised to themselves were mere delusions. The import of what is said then is, “Whence is this your security, that ye think that enemies can do you no harm? Yea, ye despise God as well as men; whence is this haughtiness? whence also is the great confidence with which ye are puffed up? Verily, it comes only from mere delusions. <em>The pride of thine heart has deceived thee.” </em></p><p>And yet there was not wanting a reason why the Idumeans were thus insolent, as the Prophet also states: but he at the same time shows that they had deceived themselves; for God cared not for their fortresses; nay, he counted them as nothing. Thou <em>dwellest, </em>he says, (this is to be regarded as a concession,) <em>in the clefts of the stone; </em>some read, “between the windings of the rock;” <span class="cite-ref">(73)</span> though others think <span class="lang he-il">סלע</span><em>Salo </em>to be the name of a city. But though I should allow that the Prophet alludes to the name of a city, I yet do not see how can that stand which they hold; for clefts comfort not with a city situated on a plain, though within the ranges of mountains. I do not then doubt but that <span class="lang he-il">סלע</span><em>Salo </em>here means mount Seir. As then the Idumeans had fortresses amidst rocks, they thought that all enemies could easily be kept out. </p><p>And hence it follows, <em>The height is his habitation</em>, that is, <em>he dwells in lofty places; </em>and hence <em>he says in his heart, Who shall draw me down to the ground? </em>He afterwards subjoins what I have already stated, — that though their region was exceedingly well fortified, yet the Idumeans were greatly deceived, and indulged themselves in vain delusions, “If thou shouldest raise up thy seat, he says, <em>like the eagle”, </em>— literally<em>, </em>‘If thou shouldest rise as the eagle,’ —<em>“and if thou shouldest among the clouds </em><span class="cite-ref">(74)</span><em>set and nest</em>, I will thence draw thee down, saith Jehovah”. We now see that the Prophet did not without reason deride the confidence with which the Idumeans were inflated, by setting up their fortresses in opposition to God: for it is the greatest madness for men to rely on their own power and to despise God himself. At the same time he could, as it were, easily dissipate by one blast every idea of defense or of power that is in us; but this subject will be more fully handled by us tomorrow. </p><p><strong>(73)</strong><em>Blayney </em>renders the same words in <span class="bvs">Jer_49:16</span>, “the encirclings of the rock:” but Parkhurst renders them “the cracks, or fissures of the rock.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(74)</strong> Literally it is, “among the stars,” <span class="lang he-il">בין כוכבים</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
