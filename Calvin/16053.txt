<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>154.</strong><em>Debate thy cause, and redeem me. </em>In this verse David specifics the kind of his affliction, which was the wrongful and harassing treatment which he met with at the hands of evil and unprincipled men. The reading literally is, <em>Plead my cause, </em>which is the same thing as to undertake a cause, or to take the charge of defending one in judgment, or to maintain the right of the oppressed. In the first place the Prophet in invoking God to defend his cause, shows that he is wrongfully oppressed, either by violence, calumnies, or crafty policies; and in seeking <em>to be redeemed, </em>he intimates that he was unable to make any resistance, or that he was so entangled in their snares, as to have no remaining hope except in the deliverance of God. In the second clause the letter <span class="lang he-il">ל</span><em>, lamed, </em>seems to be taken for the letter <span class="lang he-il">כ</span><em>, caph, </em>the mark of similitude, <span class="cite-ref">(29)</span> as would appear from his having used a little before (<span class="bvs">Psa_119:149</span>) a similar form of prayer. Again, as David here complains that he is held as it were in fetters by his enemies, unless he is delivered by the hand of his Redeemer, he with good reason beseeches God to restore him to life; for he who is rims abased is like a person dead. It is also aptly added <em>according to thy word; </em>for it is from the promises which God makes in his word of becoming our deliverer that the hope of life shines upon us. Whence the Prophet, when earnestly desiring to be brought from darkness to light, sustains and encourages himself by the word. If a different sense is preferred, then David is not to be understood as simply asking that life may be given him, but as praying for spiritual life, that he may be encouraged to exercise faith, to cultivate the fear of God, and to cherish the desire of living a holy life. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(29)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La letre</span><span class="lang he-il">כ</span>, <span class="lang fr-fr">qui signifie Sclon</span>.” —Fr. “The letter <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>, which signifies ‘According to.’” </p></div></div>
