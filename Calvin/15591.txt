<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>He hath appointed the moon to distinguish seasons </em>The Psalmist now comes to another commendation of God’s providence as manifested in the beautiful arrangement by which the course of the sun and moon alternately succeeds each other; for the diversity in their mutual changes is so far from producing confusion, that all must easily perceive the impossibility of finding any better method of distinguishing time. When it is said, that the <em>moon was appointed to distinguish seasons, </em>interpreters agree that this is to be understood of the ordinary and appointed feasts. The Hebrews having been accustomed to compute their months by the moon, this served for regulating their festival days and assemblies, both sacred and political. <span class="cite-ref">(194)</span> The prophet, I have no doubt, by the figure synecdoche, puts a part for the whole, intimating, that the moon not only distinguishes the days from the nights, but likewise marks out the festival days, measures years and months, and, in fine, answers many useful purposes, inasmuch as the distinction of times is taken from her course. As to the sentence, The <em>sun knoweth his going down, </em>I understand it not only of his daily circuit, but as also denoting that by gradually approaching nearer us at one time, and receding farther from us at another, he knows how to regulate his movements by which to make summer, winter, spring, and autumn. It is farther stated, <em>that the beasts of the forest creep forth during the night, </em>because they go out of their dens with fear. Some translate the verb <span class="lang he-il">רמש</span><em>, ramas, to walk; </em>but its proper signification which I have given is not unsuitable; for although hunger often drives wild beasts into fury, yet they <em>watch </em>for the darkness of the night, that they may move abroad from their hiding-places, and on account of this fearfulness they are said to creep forth. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(194)</span> “The greatest part of the Jewish feasts, as the New Moon, the Passover, the Pentecost, etc., were governed by the moon.” — <em>Dimoch. </em></p></div></div>
