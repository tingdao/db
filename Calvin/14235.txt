<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>Their seed shall serve him. </em>The more to exalt the greatness of the benefit, he declares that it will be of such a character that posterity will never forget it. And he shows how it will come to be perpetuated, namely, because the conversion of the world, of which he has spoken, will not be for a short time only but will continue from age to age. Whence we again conclude, that what is here celebrated is not such a manifestation of the glory of God to the Gentile nations as proceeds from a transitory and fading rumor, but such as will enlighten the world with its beams, even to the end of time. Accordingly, the perpetuity of the Church is here abundantly proved, and in very clear terms: not that it always flourishes or continues in the same uniform course through successive ages, but because God, unwilling that his name should be extinguished in the world, will always raise up some sincerely to devote themselves to his service. We ought to remember that this seed, in which the service of God was to be preserved, is the fruit of the incorruptible seed; for God begets and multiplies his Church only by means of his word. </p><p>The expression, <em>To be registered to the Lord for a generation, </em>is explained in two ways. Some take the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">דור</span>,<em>dor, </em>for <em>a succession of ages, </em>and explain the clause thus: They shall be registered to the Lord age after age. Others take it for <em>generation, </em>in the sense in which the word <em>natio </em>[nation] is used in the Latin tongue. As both these senses suit very well, and come almost to the same thing, I leave my readers at liberty to choose between them. I am, however, I admit, rather inclined to the opinion, that by this word is designated God’s chosen people and peculiar nation, which may be accounted the heritage of God. Farther, as the name <em>Jehovah, </em>which is expressive of God’s essence, is not here used as it is a little before, but the word <em>Adonai, </em>I do not disapprove of the opinion of those who think that Christ is here expressly invested with authority over <span class="cite-ref">(527)</span> the Church, that he may register all who shall give in their names as on the side of God his Father. And, indeed, as our heavenly Father has committed all his chosen ones to the protection and guardianship of his own Son, he acknowledges as his people none but those who belong to the flock of Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(527)</span> The Hebrew word <em>Adonai </em>is derived from a verb which signifies <em>to direct, rule, judge; </em>and it therefore signifies <em>director, ruler, judge. </em></p></div></div>
