<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>I receive not testimony from men. </em>Yet it was not in vain that God chose Christ to be a witness to him, and Christ himself declares, on another occasion, that the disciples </p><p>will be his witnesses. You shall be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Act_1:8</span>.) </p><p>I reply, Christ avails himself of the<em>testimony </em>of John, not because he needs it, but so far as it is advantageous to us to receive from it some confirmation. Men borrow <em>testimony </em>from one another, because they cannot dispense with that assistance. The case is different with God and Christ. For if philosophers assert that virtue has no need of foreign aid, what has man in himself to lend support to the truth of God? And Christ immediately adds, that he produces the testimony of John on their account:<em>these things I say that you may be saved. </em>By this statement he means that it is not so much from a regard to himself as from a desire to promote the advantage of men, that he raises up the heralds of his Gospel by whom he testifies to us concerning his will. In this we see also a striking proof of his wonderful goodness, by which he regulates all things for our salvation. It is therefore our duty, on the other hand, to strive that the great care which he bestows in <em>saving </em>us may not be fruitless. </p></div>
