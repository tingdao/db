<div class="comment-content"><p>She first says, that <em>all </em>her <em>valiant </em>men had been <em>trodden underfoot</em>. Now we know how much the Jews trusted in their men even to the very time when they were wholly subdued. As then they had shewed so much insolence and pride towards the prophets, it hence became a cause of greater sorrow, when Jerusalem herself saw that she was destitute of every protection, and that her valiant men were trodden under foot. She says,<em>in the midst of me. </em>And this ought to be observed; for if they had fallen on the field of battle, if they had been taken in the fields by their enemies, such a thing would not have been so grievous: but that they had been thus laid prostrate, in the very bosom of the city, was indeed a token of vengeance from above. We now see that this circumstance was not superfluous, that all the valiant men of Jerusalem were laid prostrate in <em>the midst </em>of her. </p><p>It is then said that it was the <em>fixed time</em>, when God <em>destroyed her chosen men</em>, or her youth. Should it seem preferable to take <span class="lang he-il">מועד</span>, <em>muod</em>, as meaning a congregation, I do not object; yet I do not approve of this meaning, for it seems forced. It agrees better with the context to regard it as the fixed time, the time before appointed by God to destroy all the strong men. <span class="cite-ref">(140)</span></p><p>There is then another metaphor used, — that God had <em>trodden the winepress as to the daughter of Zion</em>. This figure occurs elsewhere, as in <span class="bvs">Isa_63:1</span>, </p><p>“Who is this that cometh from Edom? and why are his garments red?” </p><p>For the Prophet wonders how God could come forth from Edom, sprinkled with blood. God answers, “The winepress have I trod alone;” that is, because he had avenged the wrongs done to his people. For we know that the Idumeans had always been incensed against the miserable Jews. Then God, in order to shew that lie was the defender of his Church, says that he came from Edom, and was sprinkled and even made wet with blood. As when any one is red with wine after having toiled in the winepress, so also is the representation in this place. We have also seen in <span class="bvs">Jer_51:33</span>, that Babylon was like a threshing-floor. The metaphor, indeed, is different, but bears a likeness to the present. As, then, God is said to tread, or to thresh, when he afflicts any land, so he is said to tread the winepress, as here. <span class="cite-ref">(141)</span> It follows, — </p><p><strong>(140)</strong> If the word be rendered “assembly,” or congregation, the meaning is, the assembly of the Chaldeans, and an allusion, as <em>Gataker </em>says, is made to the calling of the people to their feasts. It is rendered “time” by the <em>Sept</em>. and the <em>Vulg.</em>, but “assembly” by the <em>Syr</em>. To call against or upon one a fixed time, is no suitable expression. Our version is no doubt right; and with it agree <em>Blayney </em>and <em>Henderson</em>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(141)</strong> The words are as follows, — </p><p>  </p><p>The winepress has the Lord trodden as to the virgin, <LineBreak />the daughter of Judah. </p><p>The <span class="lang he-il">ל</span> sometimes means “as to,” or, with respect to. “The daughter of Judah” is in apposition with “virgin.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
