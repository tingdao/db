Nor was their self-deceit devoid of a colorable pretext, inasmuch as they were ready cheerfully to welcome death, so as to offer their lives in sacrifice, and thus to compensate for their previous hesitation and inertness. It is thus that the zeal of the wicked is fervent, when it ought to be still; whereas, when God commands, coldness and apathy possess their minds, so that they are no more aroused by His voice, than as if they were stones. In a word, when it ought to be quiet, unbelief is always active, prompt, and bold; but when God would have it advance, it is timid, slow, and dead. </p><p>In conclusion, Moses adds, that their foolish enterprise was punished; for they were not merely routed and put to flight by their enemies, but utterly destroyed. <span class="cite-ref">(79)</span> Hence we gather, that their audacity failed them in the trial, and was deficient in true courage. At the same time he recounts another sign of their senselessness, in that they left behind the ark of God, as well as Moses, and rushed forward, like doomed persons, to be slaughtered. Hence it appears that unbelievers, when carried away by the blind impulse of their zeal, are as much destitute of reason and discretion as if they deliberately conspired for their own destruction. </p><p><strong>(79)</strong> “Sed etiam contriti.” — <em>Lat. </em>“Discomfited them.” — <em>A.V. </em>The Geneva version renders the word “consumed.” — Hebr. <span class="lang he-il">ויכתום</span>, from <span class="lang he-il">כחת</span>, which Taylor renders, <em>“contundere, conterere. </em>To beat, to crush, to knock, and mash all to pieces.” </p></div>
