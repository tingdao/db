<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in the family </em>He relates another work of God, which if, apparently, not so notable, ought not, on that account, the less to engage our thoughts. Unimpressed as we are by the ordinary works of God, we are constrained to express our astonishment when a woman who has been for a long period barren, unexpectedly becomes the mother of a numerous family. The Hebrew term, <span class="lang he-il">הבית</span>, <em>habbayith, </em>is to be understood, not simply of a <em>house, </em>but also of a <em>household, </em>— <em>that </em>is, the thing containing, for that which is contained, — just as the Greeks apply <span class="lang el-gr">οικος</span>, and the Latins <em>domus, </em>to a <em>household. </em>The meaning is, that the woman who was formerly barren is blessed with fruitfulness, and fills the house with children. He attributes joy to mothers, because, though the hearts of all are prone to aspire after wealth, or honor, or pleasures, or any other advantages, yet is progeny preferred to every thing else. Wherefore, since God superintends the ordinary course of nature, alters the current of events, elevates those of abject condition and ignoble extraction, and makes the barren woman fruitful, our insensibility is very culpable, if we do not attentively contemplate the works of his hand. </p></div>
