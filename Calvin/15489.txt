<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>Ye that love Jehovah, hate evil </em>Those that fear God are here enjoined to practice righteousness, as Paul says, </p><p>“Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity,”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Ti_2:19</span>) </p><p>He shows from the very nature of God, that we cannot be judged and acknowledged to be his servants unless we depart from sin, and practice holiness. God is in himself the fountain of righteousness, and he must necessarily hate all iniquity, unless we could suppose that he should deny himself; and we have fellowship with him only on the terms of separation from unrighteousness. As the persecution of the wicked is apt to provoke us to seek revenge, and unwarrantable methods of escape, the Psalmist guards us against this temptation, by asserting that God is the keeper and protector of his people. If persuaded of being under the Divine guardianship, we will not strive with the wicked, nor retaliate injury upon those who have wronged us, but commit our safety to him who will faithfully defend it. This gracious act of condescension, by which God takes us under his care, should serve as a check to any impatience we might feel in abstaining from what is evil, <span class="cite-ref">(103)</span> and preserving the course of integrity under provocation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(103)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De nous tenir en bride, de peur qu’il ne nous soit fascheux ou grief de nous abstenir de malice</span>,” etc. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
