<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And the Lord spake. </em>Although the institution of the Passover in some degree appertains to the Fourth Commandment, where the Sabbath and Feast-days will be treated of; yet, in so far as it was a solemn symbol <span class="cite-ref">(308)</span> of their redemption, whereby the people professed their obligation to God their deliverer, and in a manner devoted themselves to His dominion, I have not hesitated to insert it here as a supplement of the First Commandment. The observation of the day itself will again recur in its proper place; it will only be suitable to observe here, that God enjoined this ceremony in order that He might wholly bind the people under obligation to Himself alone, and that from it the Israelites might learn that they should never turn away from Him, by whose kindness and hand they were redeemed. For by these means He had purchased them to Himself as His peculiar people; and, therefore, whenever He reproves them for declining from His pure worship, He complains that they were forgetful of this great favor, the memory of which ought to have been sufficient to retain them. In effect, then, the celebration of the Passover taught the Israelites that it was not lawful for them to have regard to any other God besides their Redeemer; and also that it was just and right for them to consecrate themselves to His service, since He had restored them from death to life; and thus, as in a glass or picture, He represented to their eyes His grace; and desired that they should on every succeeding year recognize what they had formerly experienced, lest it should ever depart from their memory. First, let us define what the Passover <em>(Pascha) </em>is; <span class="cite-ref">(309)</span> I use its trite and ordinary name. In its etymology there is no difficulty, except that the passage <em>(transitus) </em>of God, is equivalent to His leaping over, <em>(transilitio) </em>whereby it came to pass that the houses of the Israelites remained untouched; for Isaiah, <span class="cite-ref">(310)</span> speaking of the second redemption, unquestionably alludes to this place, when he says, I will leap over Jerusalem. The reason, then, for this expression being used is, that God’s vengeance passed over the Israelites, so as to leave them uninjured. With respect to the twofold mention by Moses of a passing-over, observe that the same word is not used in both places; but <em>Pesah </em><span class="cite-ref">(311)</span> refers to the chosen people, and <em>Abar </em>to the Egyptians; as if he had said, my vengeance shall pass through the midst of your enemies, and shall everywhere destroy them; but you I will pass over untouched. Since, then, God was willing to spare His Israel, He awakened the minds of the faithful to the hope of this salvation, by the interposition of a sign; <span class="cite-ref">(312)</span> whilst He instituted a perpetual memorial of His grace, that the Passover might every year renew the recollection of their deliverance. For the first Passover was celebrated in the very presence of the thing itself, to be a pledge to strengthen their terrified minds; but the annual repetition was a sacrifice of thanksgiving, whereby their posterity might be reminded that they were God’s rightful and peculiar dependents <em>(clientes). </em>Yet both the original institution and the perpetual law had a higher reference; for God did not once redeem His ancient people, that they might remain safely and quietly in the land, but He wished to bring them onward even to the inheritance of eternal life, wherefore the Passover was no less than Circumcision a sign of spiritual grace; and so it has an analogy and resemblance to the Holy Supper, because it both contained the same promises, which Christ now seals to us in that, and also taught that God could only be propitiated towards His people by the expiation of blood. In sum, it was the sign of the future redemption as well as of that which was past. For this reason Paul writes, that “Christ our Passover is slain,” (<span class="bvs">1Co_5:7</span>;) which would be unsuitable, if the ancients had only been reminded in it of their temporal benefit. Yet let us first establish this, that the observation of the Passover was commanded by God in the Law, that He might demand the gratitude of His people and devote to Himself those who were redeemed by His power and grace. I now descend to particulars. God commands the Israelites to begin the year with the month in which they had come out of Egypt, as if it had been the day of their birth, since that exodus was in fact a kind of new birth; <span class="cite-ref">(313)</span> for, whereas they had been buried in Egypt, the liberty given them by God was the beginning of a new life and the rising of a new light. For though their adoption had gone before, yet, since in the mean time it had almost vanished from the hearts of many, it was necessary that they should be in a manner re-begotten, that they might begin to acknowledge more certainly that God was their Father. Wherefore He says in Hosea, </p><p>“I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no God but me,” (<span class="bvs">Hos_12:9</span>, and <span class="bvs">Hos_13:4</span>;) </p><p>because He had then especially acquired them to Himself as His peculiar people; and He speaks even more clearly a little before, </p><p>“when Israel was a child, then I loved him,<LineBreak />and called my son out of Egypt.” (<span class="bvs">Hos_11:1</span>.) </p><p>Now, although it was common to the race of Abraham with other nations to begin the year with the month of March; yet in this respect the reason for it was different, for it was only to the elect people that their resurrection was annually put before their eyes. But, up to that time, the Hebrews themselves had begun their year with the month of September, which is called in Chaldee <em>Tisri, </em>and in which many suppose that the world was created; because immediately on its creation the earth produced ripe fruits, so that its fecundity was in perfection. And still there remains among the Jews a twofold manner of dating and counting their years; for, in all matters which relate to the common business of life, they retain the old and natural computation, so that the first month is the beginning of Autumn; but, in religious matters and festivals, they follow the injunctions of Moses; and this is the legal year, beginning nearly with our month of March, <span class="cite-ref">(314)</span> yet not precisely<em>, </em>because we have not their ancient <em>embolisms; </em>for, since twelve circuits of the moon would not equal the sun’s course, they were obliged to make an intercalation, lest, in progress of years, an absurd and enormous diversity should arise. Thence it happens that the month <em>Nisan, </em>in which they celebrated the Passover, begins among the Jews sometimes earlier, and sometimes later, according as the intercalation retards it. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(308)</span> Memorial. —<em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(309)</span> This paragraph not in French. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(310)</span><span class="bvs">Isa_31:5</span><em>C.’s </em>own translation of the words rendered in our <em>A.
