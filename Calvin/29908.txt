<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>They profess that they know God </em>He treats those persons as they deserve; for hypocrites, who give their whole attention to minute observances, despise fearlessly what constitutes the chief part of the Christian life. The consequence is, that they display their vanity, while contempt of God is manifested in open crimes. And this is what Paul means; that they who wish to be seen abstaining from one kind of food — indulge in wantonness and rebellion, as if they had shaken of the yoke; that their conduct is disgraceful and full of wickedness, and that not a spark of virtue is visible in their whole life. </p><p><em>For they are abominable, disobedient, and to every good work reprobate. </em>When he calls them<span class="lang el-gr">, βδελυκτούς </span><span class="cite-ref">(237)</span><em>abominable, </em>he seems to allude to their pretended holiness, to which they gave their earnest attention. But Paul declares that they gain no advantage, for they do not cease to be profane and detestable. With good reason does he accuse them of <em>disobedience; </em>for nothing can be more haughty than hypocrites, who exert themselves so laboriously about ceremonies, in order that they may have it in their power to despise with impunity the chief requirements of the law. We may appropriately interpret the word<span class="lang el-gr">ἀδόκιμοι</span><em>reprobate </em>in an active signification; as if he had said, that they who wish to be thought so sagacious instructors in trifles — are destitute of judgment and understanding as to good works. </p><p><strong>(237)</strong> “<strong>1.</strong>They are said to be<span class="lang el-gr">βδελυκτοί</span><em>, abominable</em>, or shamefully addicted to all manner of evil. The word in the original, denotes the heinousness of those practices in which they allow themselves; and is derived from a word that signifies to send forth an offensive smell. For all sentiments of right and good are not so totally lost and obliterated among mankind, but that there are some things which even pagans would detest. <strong>2.</strong>They are said to be also<span class="lang el-gr">ἀπειθείς, </span><em>disobedient</em>, which expression imports perseverance and obstinacy in an evil course. They will by no means — by no importunity — by no arguments whatever, be dissuaded from practices so unjustifiable and detestable in their own nature. They are resolved to run on, whatever it costs them — to continue in sin, and in the profession of religion at the same time, which is the greatest absurdity imaginable. <strong>3.</strong>They are said, lastly, to be<span class="lang el-gr">πρὸς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἀδόκιμοι,</span><em>reprobate to every good work</em>; which signifies a disinclination to everything that is good, to everything that is worthy of praise. ‘The word may be taken, as it is observed, either actively or passively, and so may signify not only to be disappointed by others, but to disapprove themselves; in which latter sense we must, at present, principally understand the phrase. They disapprove all that which claims their approbation and esteem; and are disaffected to all that good which the religion they profess would oblige them to the practice of. The expression, therefore, does not so much signify their omission of what is good, as their disinclination to it; but it further denotes that, if they do anything at all in religion, it is what they neither delight in, nor can endure. ‘Every good work’ is an expression of such latitude, that it may comprehend all the works of piety, mercy, and common justice. And so it is fit we should understand it in this place. Whatever they do of this kind, their hearts are averse to it, and they bear a disaffected mind to it all. And such as here described, persons may be found to be, notwithstanding their profession.” — <em>Howe. </em></p></div>
