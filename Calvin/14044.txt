<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>The ungodly in his pride, etc </em>Before uttering his prayer against the ungodly, the Psalmist briefly sets forth their wickedness in cruelly vexing the afflicted, for no other reason but because they disdain and despise them, through the pride with which they are inflated. And their cruelty is not a little enhanced from this, that, forgetful of all humanity, they contemptuously triumph over the poor and afflicted, mocking them and inflicting injuries upon them. <span class="cite-ref">(193)</span> Cruelty is, indeed, always proud, yea, rather, pride is the mother of all wrongs; for if a man did not through pride magnify himself above his neighbors, and through an overweening conceit of himself despise them, even common humanity would teach us with what humility and justice we ought to conduct ourselves towards each other. But David here intended to state that the only cause why the ungodly, whom he accuses, exercise their cruelty against the wretched and the needy, from whom they receive no provocation, is the pride and arrogance of their own spirits. Let every one, therefore, who desires to live justly and unblameably with his brethren, beware of indulging or taking pleasure in treating others disdainfully; and let him endeavor, above all things, to have his mind freed from the disease of pride. The word <span class="lang he-il">דלק</span>, <em>dalak, </em>signifies <em>to suffer persecution, </em>as well as <em>to persecute; </em>and, therefore, some prefer translating the words, <em>The poor is persecuted in the pride of the ungodly. </em><span class="cite-ref">(194)</span> They may also not improperly be rendered thus, <em>The poor burns in the pride of the ungodly, </em>because this is the more common signification of the word. The pride of the wicked, like fire, devours the poor and afflicted. </p><p><strong>(193)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En se mocquant d’eux et les outrageant</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(194)</strong><span class="lang he-il">דלק</span>, <em>dalak, </em>signifies two things, to <em>persecute, </em>and <em>to be set on fire; </em>and though we render it in the former sense, and so apply it to <span class="lang he-il">רשע</span><em>, rasha, the wicked, </em>in the active <em>tense, </em>—<em>the wicked persecutes the poor, yet </em>the ancient interpreters generally render it in the passive, and apply it to <span class="lang he-il">עני</span>, <em>anay, the poor, </em>that <em>in the pride of the wicked he is set on fire, </em>that is, brought into great <em>tribulation.” </em>—<em>Hammond. </em>The word used by the Septuagint is <span class="lang el-gr">ἐμπυριζέται</span>. There may be an allusion in the Hebrew word to the fires which persecutors have kindled for burning to death the confessors and martyrs of Christ. </p></div>
