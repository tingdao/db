<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>The old world. </em>The import of what he says is, that God, after having drowned the human race, formed again as it were a new world. This is also an argument from the greater to the less; for how can the wicked escape the deluge of divine wrath, since the whole world was once destroyed by it? For by saying that eight only were saved, he intimates that a multitude would not be a shield against God to protect the wicked; but that as many as sin shall be punished, be they few or many in number. </p><p>But it may be asked why he calls Noah <em>the preacher of righteousness. </em>Some understand that he was the preacher of the righteousness of God, inasmuch as Scripture commends God's righteousness, because he defends his own and restores them, when dead, to life. But I rather think that he is called the preacher of righteousness, because he labored to restore a degenerated world to a sound mind, and this not only by his teaching and godly exhortations, but also by his anxious toil in building the ark for the term of a hundred and twenty years. Now, the design of the Apostle is to set before our eyes God’s wrath against the wicked, so as to encourage us at the same time to imitate the saints. <span class="cite-ref">(168)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(168)</span> There is a difference of opinion as to the word “eighth:” some think that the sense is, that Noah was the eighth person who was saved at the deluge, being one of the eight who were preserved. Others render the words, “Noah, the eighth preacher of righteousness,” calculating from Enos, in whose time as it is said, “men began to call upon the name of the Lord.” (<span class="bvs">Gen_4:26</span>.) <em>Lightfoot </em>and some others, have held the latter opinion, though the former has been more generally approved. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
