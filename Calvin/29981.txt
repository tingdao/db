<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>God also bearing them witness, etc. </em>In addition to the fact, that the Apostles had what they preached from the Son of God, the Lord also proved his approbation of their preaching by miracles, as by a solemn subscription. Then they who do not reverently receive the Gospel recommended by such testimonies, disregard not only the word of God, but also his works. </p><p>He designates miracles, for the sake of amplifying their importance, by three names. They are called <em>signs </em>because they rouse men’s minds, that they may think of something higher that what appears; and <em>wonders</em>, because they present what is rare and unusual; and <em>miracles, </em>because the Lord shows in them a singular and an extraordinary evidence of his power. <span class="cite-ref">(33)</span></p><p>As to the word, <em>bearing witness, </em>or attesting, it points out the right use of miracles, even that they serve to establish the Gospel. For almost all the miracles done in all ages were performed as we find for this end, that they might be the seals of Gods word. The more strange then is the superstition of the Papists, who employ their own fictitious miracles for the purpose of overthrowing the truth of God. </p><p>The conjunction<span class="lang el-gr">συν, </span><em>together with</em>, has this meaning, that we are confirmed in the faith of the Gospel by the joint testimony of God and men; for God’s miracles were testimonies concurring with the voice of men. </p><p>He adds, <em>by the gifts </em>or distributions <em>of the Holy Spirit, </em>by which also the doctrine of the Gospel was adorned, of which they were the appendages. <span class="cite-ref">(34)</span> For why did God distribute the gifts of his Spirit, except in part that they might be helps in promulgating it, and in part that their might move through admiration the minds of men to obey it? Hence Paul says, that tongues were a sign to unbelievers. The words, <em>according to his will, </em>remind us, that the miracles mentioned could not be ascribed to any except to God alone, and that they were not wrought undesignedly, but, for the distinct purpose of sealing the truth of the Gospel. </p><p><strong>(33)</strong> These three words occur twice together in other places, <span class="bvs">Act_2:22</span>, and <span class="bvs">2Th_2:9</span>; only they are found in Acts in a different order — miracles wonders and signs. Signs and wonders are often found together both in the Old Testament, and in this order except in three places, <span class="bvs">Act_2:19</span>. The same things, as Calvin says, are no doubt meant by three words under different views. They are called “signs” or as tokens as evidence of a divine interposition; “wonders” or prodigies, as being not natural, but supernatural, and as having the effect of filling men with terror, <span class="bvs">Act_2:43</span>; and “miracles” or powers, as being the effects of a divine power. So that “signs” betoken their intention; “wonders” their characters; and “miracles” their origin, or the power which produces them. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(34)</strong> By referring to <span class="bvs">1Co_12:4</span>, we shall be able to see the meaning of “distributions of the Spirit,” which seems to have been different from signs and wonders, for in that passage there are several gifts mentioned distinct from signs and wonders, such as the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, the gift of prophecy, and the discerning of spirits. These were the distributions, or the portions, which the Spirit divined to every one “according to his will;” for the “will” here, as in <span class="bvs">1Co_12:11</span>, is the will of the Spirit. The most suitable rendering of the last clause would be “and by the gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.” There is an evident metonymy in the word “distributions;” it is used abstractly for things distributed or divided. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
