<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Let not him who is oppressed return with shame. </em>The word <em>return, </em>as it has a reference to God, is equivalent to the expression, <em>to go away empty. </em>The faithful, then, beseech Him that they may not be put to shame by suffering a repulse at his hands. They call themselves <em>afflicted, poor, </em>and <em>needy, </em>as an argument to obtain the Divine favor and mercy. It is, however, to be observed, that they do not speak insincerely, nor give an exaggerated representation of their distresses, but intimate, that by so many calamities they were brought to such a low condition, that there no longer remained for them any quarter in the world from which they could expect any help. By this example, we are taught that when we are reduced to the greatest extremity, there is a remedy always ready for our misery, in calling upon God. </p></div>
