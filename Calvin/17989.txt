<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And it shall be as when the harvest-man gathereth the corn. </em>He shews by a comparison how great will be the desolation. “As the reapers,” he says, “gather the corn in armfuls, so this multitude, though large and extended, will be mowed down by the enemies.” Now that he may not leave a remainder, he adds that at the conclusion of the harvest <em>the ears will be gleaned, </em>as if he had said, that when the multitude shall have been destroyed and the country laid bare like a field which has been reaped, even the shaken and scattered ears will not be left. Besides, he employs the metaphor of a harvest because the people, trusting to their great number, dreaded nothing; but as the reapers are not terrified by the large quantity of the corn, so he declares that their vast number will not prevent God from utterly destroying them. This may also refer to the Assyrians, but the meaning will be the same, for they were God’s servants in executing this vengeance. </p><p>We need not spend much time in explaining the word <em>gather, </em>for it means nothing else than that the slaughter will resemble a harvest, the conclusion of which has been followed by the gleaning of the ears. When the ten tribes had been carried away, the Assyrians, having learned that they were meditating a revolution, destroyed them also (<span class="bvs">2Kg_17:4</span>). He especially mentions <em>the valley of Rephaim, </em>because its fertility was well known to the Israelites. </p></div>
