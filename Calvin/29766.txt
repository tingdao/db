<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>Honor widows that are really widows. By </em>the word <em>honor </em>he does not mean any expression of respect, but that special care of them which bishops <span class="cite-ref">(85)</span> took in the ancient Church; for widows were taken under the protection of the Church, that they might be supported out of the common funds. The meaning of this mode of expression is as if he had said, “For selecting widows that are to be taken under your care and that of the deacons, you ought to consider who they are <em>that are really widows </em><span class="cite-ref">(86)</span> What was their condition we shall afterwards explain more fully. But we must here attend to the reason why Paul does not admit any but those who are absolutely widows, and, at the same time, widows without children; for, in that condition, they dedicated themselves to the Church, that they might withdraw from all the private concerns of a family, and might lay aside every hindrance. Justly, therefore, does Paul forbid to receive the mothers of families, who are already bound by a charge of a different kind. When he calls them “really widows”, he alludes to the Greek word<span class="lang el-gr">χήρα, </span> which is derived <span class="lang el-gr">ἀπὸ τοῦ χηροῦσθαι, </span> from a verb which signifies to be “deprived” or “destitute.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(85)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les Pasteurs et Evesques</span>.” — “Pastors and bishops.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(86)</span> “From what the Fathers and Greek commentators tell us, it appears that those persons were maintained from the funds of the Church; and from what follows, it is clear that they filled an office; the name <span class="lang el-gr">χήραι</span> being as much one of office as <span class="lang el-gr">διάχονες</span>, though the exact nature of its duties has not been determined. That the persons who held it instructed the younger females in the principles of the Christian faith, is pretty certain; but whether they were, as some say, ‘the same as the deaconesses,’ is yet a disputed point. It would seem that they were not necessarily the same; but that, having once been such, during the life of their husbands, they were not removed from that office. Otherwise, it would seem their duties were different from those of the deaconesses; and if we were to call them by such a name as would designate their chief duties, we might call them ‘Female Catechists.’ That these differed from the deaconesses is certain from the positive testimony of Epiphanius. Yet they might occasionally <em>assist </em>them in their duty of visiting the sick. Be that as it may, the existence of such an order as the <span class="lang el-gr">χήραι</span> requires no very strong testimony from ecclesiastical history; since, from the extremely retired life of the women in Greece and other parts of the East, and their almost total separation from the other sex, they would much <em>need </em>the assistance of such a person, who might either convert them to the Christian faith, or farther instruct them in its doctrines and duties.” — <em>Bloomfield </em></p></div></div>
