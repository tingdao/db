<div class="comment-content"><p>He wounds here the priests more grievously, — because they had so degenerated as to be wholly unworthy of their honorable office and title; “Go,” he says, “and <em>entreat the face of God</em>. ” All this is ironical; for interpreters are much mistaken who think that the Prophet here exhorts the priests humbly to ask pardon from God, both for themselves and for the people. On the contrary, he addresses them, as I have said, ironically, while telling them to be intercessors and mediators between God and the people; and yet they were profane men, who on their part polluted the whole worship of God, and thus subverted the whole of religion: go thou and <em>entreat</em>, he says, <em>the face of God</em>. This duty, we know, was enjoined on the priests; they were to draw nigh to the sanctuary and present themselves before God as though they were advocates pleading the cause of the people, or at least intercessors to pacify God. Since then they were in this respect the types of Christ, it behoved them to strive themselves to be holy; and though the people abandoned themselves to all kinds of wickedness, it yet became the priests to devote themselves with all reverence to the duties of their calling; and as God had preferred them to their brethren, they ought especially to have consecrated themselves to him with all fear; for the more excellent their condition was, the more eminent ought to have been their piety and holiness. Justly then does the Prophet here inveigh so severely against them, because they did not consider that they were honored with the priesthood, that they might entreat God, and thus pacify his wrath, and reconcile to him miserable men: Go, he says, and <em>entreat the face of God</em>; forsooth! <em>he will accept your face</em>. We now understand the real meaning of the Prophet. </p><p><em>And now</em>, he says, <em>he will have mercy on us</em>. Here also the Prophet derides them, because they boasted that they could prevail through their own high dignity to render God propitious; forsooth! he says, <em>he will have mercy on us</em>. But <em>this is done by your hand</em>, <em>i.e., by you. </em>“Do ye raise up your hands to God? and will he on seeing you be pacified towards you? As then ye are polluted, ye are unworthy of the honor and office, in which ye so proudly glory.” </p><p>He does not however, as we have already said, extenuate the fault of the people, and much less does he exempt them from guilt who were implicated in the same crimes; but he shows that the state of things was wholly desperate; for the common people disregarded God, and the priests, neglecting to make any distinctions, received every sort of victims, only that they might not be in want: he shows them that the state of the people was extremely bad, as there was no one who could, according to what his office required, pacify God. <em>Will he </em>then <em>receive your face </em>? The Prophet seems to allude to the person of the Mediator; for as Christ had not as yet appeared, when the priest presented himself before the altar, it was the same as though God looked on the face of one, and became thus propitious to all. On this account he says, that the priests were not worthy that God should look on them, since they had polluted his sanctuary and corrupted his whole service. <span class="cite-ref">(205)</span> For the same purpose he subjoins — </p><p><strong>(205)</strong> It is generally admitted that this verse is ironical. The second line has been differently interpreted: some regard the impure sacrifices before mentioned as being referred to, “from your hand have these come,” following the <em>Septuagint</em>, where <span class="lang he-il">זאת</span> is rendered “<span class="lang el-gr">ταυτα </span> — these:” but the most obvious meaning is that given by <em>Calvin</em>, that the sentence is a concession as to what the priests are ironically exhorted to do. I give the following version, — </p><p>And now, intreat now God’s face that he may favor us; By you (<em>literally </em>by your hand) has this been done: Will he on your account lift up the face? Saith Jehovah of hosts. </p><p>To “lift up the face” is to show favor. The words seem to be spoken by the Prophet, and by saying, “saith Jehovah,” at the end, he identifies what he says with the mind of God, as though he said that what he addressed to them was communicated to him from above. Instead of <span class="lang he-il">מכם</span>, “on your account,” some MS., have <span class="lang he-il">לכם</span>, “for you,” or “for your sake.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
