<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>For the earth, etc. </em>This is a similitude most appropriate to excite a desire to make progress in due time, for as the earth cannot bring forth a good crop in harvest except it causes the seed as soon as it is sown to germinate, so if we desire to bring forth good fruit, as soon as the Lord sows his word, it ought to strike roots in us without delay; for it cannot be expected to fructify, if it be either choked or perish. But as the similitude is very suitable, so it must be wisely applied to the design of the Apostle. </p><p>The earth, he says, which by sucking in the rain immediately produces a blade suitable to the seed sown, at length by God’s blessing produces a ripe crop; so they who receive the seed of the Gospel into their hearts and bring forth genuine shoots, will always make progress until they produce ripe fruit. On the contrary, the earth, which after culture and irrigation brings, forth nothing but thorns, affords no hope of a harvest; nay, the more that grows which is its natural produce, the more hopeless is the case. Hence the only remedy the husbandman has is to burn up the noxious and useless weeds. So they who destroy the seed of the Gospel either by their indifference or by corrupt affections, so as to manifest no sign of good progress in their life, clearly show themselves to be reprobates, from whom no harvest can be expected. </p><p>The Apostle then not only speaks here of the fruit of the Gospel, but also exhorts us promptly and gladly to embrace it, and he further tells us, that the blade appears presently after the seed is sown, and that growing follows the daily irrigations. Some render<span class="lang el-gr">θοτάνην εὔθετὸν </span> “a seasonable shoot,” others, “a shoot meet;” either meaning suits the place; the first refers to time, the second to quality. <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> The allegorical meanings with which interpreters have here amused themselves, I pass by, as they are quite foreign to the object of the writer. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(100)</span> The word<span class="lang el-gr">βοτάνη </span> here means everything the earth produces service for food. It only occurs here in the New Testament, but is commonly used by the Sept. for <span class="lang he-il">עשב</span>, which has the same extensive meaning: fruit or fruits would be its best rendering here. The word<span class="lang el-gr">εὔθετος </span> is also found in <span class="bvs">Luk_9:62</span>; and it means fit, meet, suitable, or useful; and the last is the meaning given it here by Grotius, Schleusner, Stuart, Bloomfield, and others. It is indeed true that it is used in the Sept. in the sense of seasonable. See <span class="bvs">Psa_32:6</span> — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
