<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>In the seventh month, in the first day of the month. </em>I wonder how it ever entered the mind of the Jews <span class="cite-ref">(349)</span> that in the feast of trumpets the deliverance of Isaac was commemorated, when a goat was substituted to be slain in his stead; <span class="cite-ref">(350)</span> but they have invented this with their wonted audacity. Surely it is as baseless as it is unreasonable. Others more rightly suppose that it was a preparation for the approaching feast of atonement, on account of the slight interval of time; for since this day is distinguished by no peculiar mark, it is probable that it ought not to be separated from the other which follows soon afterwards, viz., on the tenth day. Unless, perhaps, it is more probable that they were thus called together once a year by the sound of trumpets, first of all, that they might learn that all their sacred assemblies were appointed by the voice of God; and secondly, that this His voice was thus renewed, that they might always be ready to obey Him. And this seems to signify by the expression, “a memorial of blowing of trumpets;” as if He had said that the trumpets sounded in their ears once a year, that they might be attentive to God’s voice throughout their lives, and ever willing to follow whithersoever He should command them to go. Others think that the trumpets sounded at the beginning of the month, that they might prepare themselves for the three festivals, and also because this month was remarkable both in the Sabbatical year and in the Jubilee. But what, if when God displaced this month from being the beginning of the year to stand seventh, He chose to leave it some traces of its original dignity? for by general consent it is admitted that, until the people came out of Egypt, this was the first month. Some even think that the world was created in it, which is not without probable show of reason. And the Jews now also, in political matters and in things which relate to this earthly life, retain this original computation in accordance with unbroken custom: it is only in sacred matters that they commence the year in March. This indeed seems to me the probable reason why, on the day now referred to, God renewed the memory of His dominion by a solemn proclamation, and assigned this seventh month both to the Jubilee and the Sabbatical year. <span class="cite-ref">(351)</span> The solemnity was completed in one day, differing very little from an ordinary Sabbath, except by the trumpet-blowing and the sacrifice, as is described in <span class="bvs">Num_29:0</span>. For Moses there speaks of more than he does here; he there enumerates a calf, a ram, seven lambs, a goat for a sin-offering, with its accompaniments, besides the burnt-offering of the new moon, and commands an offering to be made by fire of them all. Here he speaks generally in a single word. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(349)</span> “The Hebrews and Latins hold that the feast of trumpets was instituted in memory of the patriarch Isaac having been delivered from the sword of his father, and of the ram supplied in his place, (<span class="bvs">Gen_22:11</span>,) and thence that they used to blow rams’ horns on that day, etc. Moreover, the Hebrews report that on this very day, <em>i.e., </em>the first of the seventh month, Isaac was delivered from slaughter. This blowing of trumpets was therefore a memorial of Isaac’s deliverance, and also a silent prayer that God would remember them, and as He had delivered Isaac, would also deliver his posterity from peril of death.” — Corn. a Lapide, <em>in loco; </em>see also R.
