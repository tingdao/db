<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>Remember this. </em>The prophet having encouraged the hearts of the godly by magnifying the divine power and goodness, now returns to the prosecution of his prayer. He first complains that the enemies of his people revile God, and yet continue unpunished. When he says, <em>Remember this, </em>the manner of expression is emphatic; and the occasion demanded it, for it is not a crime of small magnitude to treat with contumely the sacred name of God. For the sake of contrast, he states that it was a <em>worthless </em>or <em>foolish people </em>who thus presumed insolently to pour forth their reproaches against God. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">נבל</span>, <em>nabal, </em>denotes not only <em>a foolish man, </em>but also <em>a wicked and infamous person. </em>The prophet, therefore, justly describes the despisers of God as people who are vile and worthless. </p></div>
