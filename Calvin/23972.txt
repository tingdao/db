<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And the gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world. </em>Our Lord, having delivered a discourse which gave no small occasion for sorrow, seasonably adds this consolation, to raise up minds that were cast down, or to uphold those which were falling. Whatever may be the contrivances of Satan, and how numerous soever may be the multitudes which he carries away, yet <em>the gospel </em>will maintain its ground till it be spread <em>through the whole world. </em>This might indeed appear to be incredible; but it was the duty of the apostles, relying on this testimony of their Master, to cherish hope against hope, and, in the meantime, to strive vigorously to discharge their office. As to the objection brought by some, that to this day not even the slightest report concerning Christ has reached the <em>Antipodes </em>and other very distant nations, this difficulty may be speedily resolved; for Christ does not absolutely refer to every portion of the world, and does not fix a particular time, but only affirms that <em>the gospel </em>—which, all would have thought, was immediately to be banished from Judea, its native habitation would be spread to the farthest bounds of the world before the day of his last coming. </p><p><em>For a testimony to all nations. </em>He describes this to be the end of preaching; for although </p><p>God has never left himself (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀμάρτυρον</span>) without witness, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Act_14:17</span>,) </p><p>and although in special manner he testified to the Jews concerning himself, yet it was <em>a testimony </em>remarkable beyond all others when he revealed himself in Christ; and therefore Paul says, that he was <em>manifested in due time, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Ti_2:6</span>,) because this was the proper season for calling the whole world to God. Let us, therefore, learn that, wherever the gospel is preached, it is as if God himself came into the midst of us, and solemnly and expressly besought us, that we may not wander in darkness, as if we knew not where to go, and that those who refuse to obey may be rendered inexcusable. </p><p><em>And then will the end come. </em>This is improperly restricted by some to the destruction of the temple, and the abolition of the service of the Law; for it ought to be understood as referring to <em>the end </em>and renovation of the world. Those two things having been blended by the disciples, as if the temple could not be overthrown without the destruction of <em>the whole world, </em>Christ, in replying to the whole question which had been put to him, reminded them that a long and melancholy succession of calamities was at hand, and that they must not hasten to seize the prize, before they had passed through many contests and dangers. In this manner, therefore, we ought to explain this latter clause: “The end of the world will not come before I have tried my Church, for a long period, by severe and painful temptations,” for it is contrasted with the false imagination which the apostles had formed in their minds. Hence, too, we ought to learn that no particular time is here fixed, as if the last day were to follow in immediate succession those events which were just now foretold; for the believers long ago experienced the fulfillment of those predictions which we have now examined, and yet Christ did not immediately appear. But Christ had no other design than to restrain the apostles, who were disposed to fly with excessive eagerness to the possession of the heavenly glory, and to show them the necessity of patience; as if he had said, that redemption was not so close at hand as they had imagined it to be, but that they must pass through long windings. </p></div>
