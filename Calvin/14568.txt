<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>Judge me, O God! </em>David, in the first place, complains of the extreme cruelty of his enemies; but in the verses which immediately follow, he shows that there was nothing which he felt to be more grievous, than to be deprived of the opportunity of access to the sanctuary. We have an evidence of his enjoying the testimony of a good conscience in this, that he commends the defense of his cause to God. The term <em>judge, </em>which he first makes use of, is nothing else than <em>to undertake the defense of one’s cause; </em>and he expresses his meaning more clearly by adding, <em>plead my cause </em>The substance and object of his prayer, indeed, were, that he might be delivered from the wicked and malicious men by whom he was undeservedly persecuted. But as it is to the miserable and guiltless, who are wrongfully afflicted, that God promises his help, David, in the first place, submits himself to be examined by him, that, having discovered and thoroughly proved the rectitude of his cause, he may at length grant him aid. And as it is a most cheering source of consolation for us to find that God disdains not to take cognisance of our cause, so also, it is vain for us to expect that he will avenge the injuries and wrongs which are done to us, unless our own integrity be so manifest as to induce him to be favorable to us against our adversaries. By <em>the unmerciful nation </em>is to be understood the whole company of David’s enemies, who were cruel, and destitute of all the feelings of humanity. What follows, concerning <em>the deceitful and wicked man, </em>might indeed be applied to Saul; but it seems rather to be a form of speech in which, by enallage, the singular number is used for the plural. </p></div>
