<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>For God hath not appointed us</em>. As he has spoken of the <em>hope of salvation, </em>he follows out that department, and says that God has appointed us to this — that we <em>may obtain salvation through Christ</em>. The passage, however, might be explained in a simple way in this manner — that we must <em>put on the helmet of salvation</em>, because God wills not that we should perish, but rather that we should be saved. And this, indeed, Paul means, but, in my opinion, he has in view something farther. For as the day of Christ is for the most part regarded with alarm, <span class="cite-ref">(599)</span> having it in view to close with the mention of it, he says that we are <em>appointed to salvation </em></p><p>The Greek term <span class="lang el-gr">περιποίησις</span> means <em>enjoyment</em>, (as they speak,) as well as <em>acquisition</em>. Paul, undoubtedly, does not mean that God has called us, that we may procure salvation for ourselves, but that we may obtain it, as it has been acquired for us by Christ. Paul, however, encourages believers to fight strenuously, setting before them the certainty of victory; for the man who fights timidly and hesitatingly is half-conquered. In these words, therefore, he had it in view to take away the dread which arises from distrust. There cannot, however, be a better assurance of salvation gathered, than from the decree <span class="cite-ref">(600)</span> of God. The term <em>wrath</em>, in this passage, as in other instances, is taken to mean the judgment or vengeance of God against the reprobate. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(599)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’autant que volontiers nous auons en horreur et craignons le iour du Seigneur</span>;” — “Inasmuch as we naturally regard with horror, and view with dread the day of the Lord.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(600)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Du decret et ordonnance de Dieu</span>;” — “From the decree and appointment of God.” </p></div></div>
