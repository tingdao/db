<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Israel then shall dwell in safety alone. </em><span class="cite-ref">(328)</span> The beginning of the verse is by no means obscure, for Moses promises in it to the elect people what all have naturally a great desire for, viz., peace or tranquillity; for he is said to <em>dwell </em>confidently<em>alone, </em>who: fears no danger, whom no care harasses, and who needs no garrison, or defense. This, indeed, God never vouchsafed altogether to the Israelites, that they should inhabit their land in security and without the fear of enemies, inasmuch as their ingratitude did not allow of it; and therefore the prophets, in enumerating the blessings of Christ’s kingdom, declare that every one should “dwell beneath his own vine, and his own fig-tree.” </p><p>For “the<em>fountain </em>of Jacob,” some have the word <em>eye, </em><span class="cite-ref">(329)</span> and suppose it to be used metaphorically for his vision; as though it were said, that the quiet and peaceful habitation referred to was to be expected by the people from the vision of their father Jacob. Others, however, more correctly read the words “fountain of Jacob,” in apposition (with Israel,) inasmuch as all the tribes derived their origin from that one father. In this way the “fountain” will not be only the actual source; but the rivulet, or stream, which flows down from it. </p><p>In conclusion, Moses promises that the very sky of the Holy Land should be propitious, and benignant. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(328)</span><em>Lat</em>. , “Israel <em>hath </em>dwelt,” etc. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(329)</span><span class="lang he-il">עין</span>.
