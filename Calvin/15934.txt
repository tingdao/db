<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong><em>Direct me in the path </em>The frequent repetition of this phraseology by the prophet is not to be considered as redundant. Seeing that the end of man’s existence ought to consist in profiting in God’s school, we nevertheless perceive how the world distracts him by its allurements, and how he also forms for himself a thousand avocations calculated to withdraw his thoughts from the main business of his life. The next clause of the verse, <em>in it I take pleasure, </em>must be carefully attended to. For it is an indication of rare excellence when a person so arranges his sentiments and affections as to renounce all the enticements pleasant to the flesh, and take delight in nothing so much as in the service of God. The prophet had already attained to this virtue but he still perceives that he is not yet perfect. Therefore, that his desire may be fully accomplished, he solicits fresh assistance from God, according to the saying of Paul, </p><p>“It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasures” <span class="bvs">Phi_2:13</span>. </p><p>Let it be remembered, that he does not boast of the inherent working of his nature, but sets forth the grace he has received, that God may complete the work he has begun. “Lord, thou hast given me courage, grant me also strength.” Hence in the term <em>pleasure </em>there is an implied opposition to the lusts of the flesh, which keep the hearts of mankind lettered by their enticements. </p></div>
