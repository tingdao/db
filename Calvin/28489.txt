<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>But to avoid fornication </em>He now commands, that those who are liable to the vice of incontinency should have recourse to the remedy. For though it may seem that the statement is universal, it ought, nevertheless, to be restricted to those who feel themselves urged by necessity. As to this, every one must judge for himself. Whatever difficulty, therefore, is perceived to be in marriage, let all that cannot resist the promptings of their flesh, know that this commandment has been enjoined upon them by the Lord. But it is asked — “Is this the only reason for entering into matrimony, that we may cure incontinency?” I answer, that this is not Paul’s meaning; for as for those that have the gift of abstinence from marriage, he leaves <em>them </em>at liberty, <span class="cite-ref">(371)</span> while he commands others to provide against their infirmity by marrying. The sum is this — that the question is not as to the reasons for which marriage has been instituted, but as to the persons for whom it is necessary. For if we look to the first institution, it could not be a remedy for a disease which had as yet no existence, but was appointed for begetting offspring; but after the fall, this second purpose was added. </p><p>This passage is also opposed to (<span class="lang el-gr">τολυγαμία</span>)<em>polygamy </em>For the Apostle desires that <em>every woman have her own husband</em>, intimating that the obligation is mutual. The man, therefore, who has once pledged his fidelity to a woman as his wife, must not separate from her, as is manifestly done in case of a second connection. </p><p><strong>(371)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il laisse la liberte de se marier ou ne se marier point</span>;” — “He gives liberty to marry or not marry.” </p></div>
