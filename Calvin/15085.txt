<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>There he broke the arrows of the bow. </em>We have here stated the particular way in which God was known in Judah. He was known by the wonderful proofs of his power, which he exhibited in preserving the city. Under these figures is described the destruction of the enemies of the chosen people. <span class="cite-ref">(268)</span> They could not otherwise have been overthrown than by being despoiled of their armor and weapons of war. It is therefore said, that <em>the arrows, the swords, and the shields, were broken, </em>yea, all the implements of war; implying that these impious enemies of the Church were deprived of the power of doing harm. The fact indeed is, that they were wounded and slain, while their weapons remained uninjured; but this metonymy, by which what befell themselves is represented as happening to their implements of war, is not improper. Some translate the word <span class="lang he-il">רשפים</span>, <em>reshaphim, points </em>of weapons! Properly, it should be rendered<em>fires; </em><span class="cite-ref">(269)</span> but it is more accurate to take it for <em>arrows. </em>Even birds are sometimes metaphorically so called, on account of their swiftness; and flying is attributed to arrows in <span class="bvs">Psa_91:6</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(268)</span> “This seems to allude to the miraculous destruction of the Assyrian army, as recorded in <span class="bvs">Isa_27:36</span>.” — <em>Warner</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(269)</span> “The Hebrew <span class="lang he-il">רשף</span>, [here rendered <em>arrows</em>, ] signifies fire, <span class="bvs">Job_5:7</span>, where ‘sparks that fly upward’ are poetically expressed by <span class="lang he-il">בני רשף</span>, ‘the sons of the fire.’ By metaphor it is applies to an ‘arrow’ or ‘dart’ shot out of a bow, and, by the swiftness of the motion, supposed to be inflamed. See <span class="bvs">Son_8:6</span>, where of love it is said, (not the <em>coals</em>, but) ‘the arrows thereof are arrows of fire,’ it shoots, and wounds, and burns a man’s heart, inflames it vehemently by wounding it. The poetical expression will best be preserved by retaining some trace of the primary sense in the rendering of it — ‘fires or lightnings of the bow,’<em>i e</em>. , those hostile weapons which are most furious and formidable, as fire shot out from a bow.” — <em>Hammond </em>Parkhurst renders “glittering flashing arrows,” or rather, “fiery, or fire-bearing arrows;” such as, it is certain, were used in after times in sieges and in battles; the <span class="lang el-gr">βελη πεπυρωμενα</span> of the Greeks, to which Paul alludes in <span class="bvs">Eph_6:16</span>, and <em>the phalarica </em>of the Romans, which Servius (on Virgil, Æn. lib. 9, 5, 705) describes as a dart or javelin with a spherical leaden head, to which combustible matter was attached, which being set on fire, the weapon was darted against the enemy; and when thrown by a powerful hand, it killed those whom it hit, and set fire to buildings. Walford has, “fiery arrows.” “The arrows,” says he, “are described as fiery, to denote either the rapidity of their motion, or that they were tinged with some poisonous drugs to render them more deadly.” </p></div></div>
