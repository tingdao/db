<div class="comment-content"><p>He confirms the preceding verse, and says that there would be no counsel nor wisdom in the leading men: for the<em>shepherds </em>of the king of Assyria were his counselors, in whose wisdom he trusted, as we know that kings usually depend on their counselors: for they think that there is in them prudence enough, and therefore they commit to them the care of the whole people. But the Prophet ridicules the confidence of the king of Assyria, because the shepherds would not have so much vigilance as to take care of themselves, and of the people, and of the whole kingdom. He speaks in the past tense, either to show the certainty of the prediction, or because the change of tenses is common in Hebrew. <em>Lie still, </em>he says,<em>shall thy mighty men; </em><span class="cite-ref">(250)</span> that is, they shall remain idle; they shall not be able to sally out against their enemies, to stop their progress. <em>They shall </em>then <em>lie still: </em>and then he says, <em>Scattered are thy people </em><span class="lang he-il">פוש</span>, <em>push, </em>is not to scatter; hence I doubt not, but that there is a change of letter, that <span class="lang he-il">ש</span>, <em>schin, </em>is put for <span class="lang he-il">ץ</span>, <em>tzaddi; </em>and I am surprised that some derive the verb from <span class="lang he-il">פוש</span>, <em>push</em>, when, on the contrary, it is from <span class="lang he-il">פוף</span>, <em>puts</em>, and the change of these two letters is common in Hebrew. <em>Thy people </em>then <em>are dispersed on the mountains and there is no one to assemble them </em></p><p>By these words the Prophet means, that such would be the scattering of the whole kingdom, that there would be no hope of restoration; <em>There will </em>then <em>be none to assemble them </em>He had said before that the chiefs or mighty men would be still. Though it would be needful to go forth to check the progress of their enemies; yet he says, <em>They shall idly lie down: </em>He refers here to their sloth. But the people who ought to be quiet at home, as being weak and feeble, <em>shall be dispersed on the mountains, and no one will be there to gather them </em>It follows — </p><p><strong>(250)</strong><em>Fortes tui </em>, <span class="lang he-il">אדיריך</span>, thy eminents, thy nobles. “The shepherds,” the governers of the people, <span class="lang he-il">נמו</span>, slumber; and the nobles, the princes, <span class="lang he-il">ישכנו</span>, rest, sit still, without making any effort: then it follows, — </p><p><em>Dispersed are thy people on the mountains, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And </em>there is<em>no gatherer. </em></p><p>Calvin is mistaken as to the meaning of the verb <span class="lang he-il">פוש</span> : it means more properly, than the other, a dispersed state. It is applied in <span class="bvs">Lev_13:5</span>, and in other places, to the <em>spreading </em>of leprosy. When so used, it is in Kal. It is here, and here only, in Niphal. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
