<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>According to the gospel of glory </em>By calling it “the gospel of glory,” that is, “the glorious gospel,” he sharply rebukes those who labored to degrade the gospel, in which God displays his glory. He expressly says that it <em>hath been intrusted to him, </em>that all may know that there is no other gospel of God than that which he preaches; and consequently, that all the fables which he formerly rebuked are at variance both with the law and with the gospel of God. </p></div>
