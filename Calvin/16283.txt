<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Their judges have been thrown down upon stony places </em><span class="cite-ref">(240)</span> Almost all interpreters agree, that the tense of the verb should be changed from the preterit to the future, and then resolve it into the optative —<em>let them be thrown down</em>. It appears to me that the sense of David would be made very plain by reading, <em>When their judges have been cast down from the rock, or upon stony places, they shall hear my words</em>. David, on perceiving the rage which the common people expressed towards him, as carried away through the influence of error and misrepresentation, lays the blame upon their leaders. When their power should be taken away, he is confident that the simple, who had been misled, would be brought to a right mind. <em>Casting from the rocks, or upon stony places, </em>is a metaphorical expression in reference to the high and dignified position in which they were placed. Although not without blame in following evil counselors so as to persecute unjustly a good and godly man, yet he had reason to entertain more hope of their repentance, that they would return to consideration when God executed vengeance upon those who were at their head. We see how ready the common people are to judge by impulse rather than deliberation, and to be hurried into most condemnable proceedings by blind prejudice, while afterwards upon being admonished they retrace their steps with equal precipitation. So that, granting cruelty must always be sinful, and simplicity no excuse, we are taught by David’s example to pray that sound counsel may be sent to such as are in error, with a view to enabling them to hear the truth and the right with patience. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(240)</span> Those who understand this verse as containing an allusion to the generous manner in which David acted towards Saul in the cave of En-gedi, and to his mild expostulation after they had both left the cave, translate thus: — </p><p><em>“Their princes on the sides of the rock were dismissed, </em><em><LineBreak /></em>or<em>let go </em>in safety<em>; And they heard my words that they were pleasant.” </em></p><p>This exactly corresponds with the occurrences referred to. In correspondence with the first line, it, is said in <span class="bvs">1Sa_24:2</span>, that Saul and his chosen men went to seek David upon the <em>rocks </em>of the wild goats; and the terms in which David expostulated with Saul, were so gentle, dutiful and affecting, as for the time to melt into tenderness and contrition the heart of Saul, and to impress the minds of all who heard them. </p></div></div>
