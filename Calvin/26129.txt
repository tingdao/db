How this applies to the case in hand; for if it flowed in a uniform motion like water, it would be less miraculous. </p><p><em>So is every one that is born of the Spirit. </em>Christ means that the movement and operation of the Spirit of God is not less perceptible in the renewal of man than the motion of the air in this earthly and outward life, but that the manner of it is concealed; and that, therefore, we are ungrateful and malicious, if we do not adore the inconceivable power of God in the heavenly life, of which we behold so striking an exhibition in this world, and if we ascribe to him less in restoring the salvation of our soul than in upholding the bodily frame. The application will be somewhat more evident, if you turn the sentence in this manner: <em>Such is the power and efficacy of the Holy Spirit in the renewed man </em></p></div>
