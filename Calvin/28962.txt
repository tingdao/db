<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Now the case is this </em><span class="cite-ref">(719)</span> He now commends alms-giving by a beautiful similitude, comparing it to sowing. For in sowing, the seed is cast forth by the hand, is scattered upon the ground on this side and on that, is harrowed, and at length rots; and thus it seems as good as lost. The case is similar as to alms-giving. What goes from you to some other quarter seems as if it were, diminishing of what you have, but the season of harvest will come, when the fruit will be gathered. For as the Lord reckons every thing that is laid out upon the poor as given to himself, so he afterwards requites it with large interest. (<span class="bvs">Pro_19:17</span>.) </p><p>Now for Paul’s similitude. He that<em>sows sparingly </em>will have a poor harvest, corresponding to the sowing: he that <em>sows bountifully </em>and with a full hand, will reap a correspondingly bountiful harvest. Let this doctrine be deeply rooted in our minds, that, whenever carnal reason keeps us back from doing good through fear of loss, we may immediately defend ourselves with this shield — “But the Lord declares that we are <em>sowing. </em>” The <em>harvest, </em>however, should be explained as referring to the spiritual recompense of eternal life, as well as to earthly blessings, which God confers upon the beneficent. For God requites, not only in heaven, but also in this world, the beneficence of believers. Hence it is as though he had said, “The more beneficent you are to your neighbors, you will find the blessing of God so much the more abundantly poured out upon you.” He again contrasts here <em>blessing </em>with <em>sparing, </em>as he had previously done with <em>niggardliness. </em>Hence it appears, that it is taken to mean — a large and bountiful liberality. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(719)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Or ie di ceci</span>;” — “Now this I say.” </p></div></div>
