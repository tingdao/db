<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>It is therefore of faith, etc. </em>This is the winding up of the argument; and you may summarily include the whole of it in this statement, — “If the heirship of salvation comes to us by works, then faith in it vanishes, the promise of it is abolished; but it is necessary that both these should be sure and certain; hence it comes to us by faith, so that its stability being based on the goodness of God alone, may be secured.” See how the Apostle, regarding faith as a thing firm and certain, considers hesitancy and doubt as unbelief, by which faith is abolished, and the promise abrogated. And yet this doubting is what the schoolmen call a moral conjecture, and which, alas! they substitute for faith. </p><p><em>That it might be by grace</em>, <em>etc. </em>Here, in the first place, the Apostle shows, that nothing is set before faith but mere grace; and this, as they commonly say, is its object: for were it to look on merits, absurdly would Paul infer, that whatever it obtains for us is gratuitous. I will repeat this again in other words, — “If grace be everything that we obtain by faith, then every regard for works is laid in the dust.” But what next follows more fully removes all ambiguity, — that the promise then only stands firm, when it recumbs on grace: for by this expression Paul confirms this truth, that as long as men depend on works, they are harassed with doubts; for they deprive themselves of what the promises contain. Hence, also, we may easily learn, that grace is not to be taken, as some imagine, for the gift of regeneration, but for a gratuitous favor: for as regeneration is never perfect, it can never suffice to pacify souls, nor of itself can it make the promise certain. </p><p><em>Not to that only which is of the law, etc. </em>Though these words mean in another place those who, being absurd zealots of the law, bind themselves to its yoke, and boast of their confidence in it, yet here they mean simply the Jewish nation, to whom the law of the Lord had been delivered. For Paul teaches us in another passage, that all who remain bound to the dominion of the law, are subject to a curse; it is then certain that they are excluded from the participation of grace. He does not then call them the servants of the law, who, adhering to the righteousness of works, renounce Christ; but they were those Jews who had been brought up in the law, and yet professed the name of Christ. But that the sentence may be made clearer, let it be worded thus, — “Not to those only who are of the law, but to all who imitate the faith of Abraham, though they had not the law before.” </p><p><em>Who is the father of us all, etc. </em>The relative has the meaning of a causative particle; for he meant to prove, that the Gentiles were become partakers of this grace, inasmuch as by the same oracle, by which the heirship was conferred on Abraham and his seed, were the Gentiles also constituted his seed: for he is said to have been made the father, not of one nation, but of many nations; by which was presignified the future extension of grace, then confined to Israel alone. For except the promised blessing had been extended to them, they could not have been counted as the offspring of Abraham. The past tense of the verb, according to the common usage of Scripture, denotes the certainty of the Divine counsel; for though nothing then was less apparent, yet as God had thus decreed, he is rightly said to have been made the father of many nations. Let the testimony of Moses be included in a parenthesis, that this clause, “Who is the father of us all,” may be connected with the other, “before God,” etc.: for it was necessary to explain also what that relationship was, that the Jews might not glory too much in their carnal descent. Hence he says, “He is our <em>father before God; </em>” which means the same as though he had said, “He is our spiritual father;” for he had this privilege, not from his own flesh, but from the promise of God <span class="cite-ref">(142)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(142)</span> It appears from [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Hammond </span>], that some of the Fathers such as [<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>], and [<span class="bvs">Theophylact </span>], regarded<span class="lang el-gr">κατέναντι </span> in the sense of <span class="lang el-gr">ὁμοίως, </span><em>like</em>, and have rendered the passage, “like God, in whom he believed;” that is, that as God is not partial, but the Father of all, so Abraham was. But this meaning is not consistent with the import of<span class="lang el-gr">κατέναντι, </span> nor with the context. The preposition is found in four other places, <span class="bvs">Mar_11:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_12:41</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_13:3</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_19:30</span>, and invariably means <em>before</em>, or, <em>over against</em>. The <em>Septuagint </em>use it in <span class="bvs">Num_25:4</span>, in the sense of <em>before </em><span class="lang el-gr">, κατέναντι τοῦ ἡλίου </span> — “before the sun,” not “<em>against </em>the sun” as in our version; for the word in Hebrew is <span class="lang he-il">נגד</span>, <em>Coram</em>, <em>in conspectu </em>. The context also requires this meaning: Abraham was a father of many nations<em>before </em>God, or, in the view or estimation of God, and not in the view or estimation of men, because God, as it is said at the end of the verse, regards things which are not, as though they were. Hence Abraham was already in God’s view, according to his purpose, the father of many nations. </p><p>The collocation of the words is said by [<span class="bvs">Wolfius </span>] to be an instance of Atticism, the word<span class="lang el-gr">θεοῦ, </span> being separated from its preposition: and<span class="lang el-gr">οὗ </span> is put for ᾧ by the grammatical law of attraction; and [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] brings three similar instances of the relative being regulated by the case of its noun, though preceding it in the sentence, <span class="bvs">Mar_6:16</span>, <span class="bvs">Act_21:16</span>; and <span class="bvs">Rom_6:17</span></p></div></div>
