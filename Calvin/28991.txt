For many are zealous — for themselves, not for God. <em>That </em>on the other hand, is the only pious and right zeal, that has an eye to God, that he may not be defrauded of the honors that of right belong to him. </p><p><em>For I have united you to one man. </em>That his zeal was of such a nature, he proves from the design of his preaching, for its tendency was to join them to Christ in marriage, and retain them in connection with him. <span class="cite-ref">(798)</span> Here, however, he gives us in his own person a lively picture of a good minister; for One alone is the Bridegroom of the Church — the Son of God. All ministers are the <em>friends of the Bridegroom, </em>as the Baptist declares respecting himself. (<span class="bvs">Joh_3:29</span>.) Hence all ought to be concerned, that the fidelity of this sacred marriage remain unimpaired and inviolable. This they cannot do, unless they are actuated by the dispositions of the Bridegroom, so that every one of them may be as much concerned for the purity of the Church, as a husband is for the chastity of his wife. Away then with coldness and indolence in this matter, for one that is cold <span class="cite-ref">(799)</span> will never be qualified for this office. Let them, however, in the mean time, take care, not to pursue their own interest rather than that of Christ, that they may not intrude themselves into his place, lest while they give themselves out as his <em>paranymphs, </em><span class="cite-ref">(800)</span> they turn out to be in reality adulterers, by alluring the bride to love themselves. </p><p><em>To present you as a chaste virgin. </em>We are married to Christ, on no other condition than that we bring virginity as our dowry, and preserve it entire, so as to be free from all corruption. Hence it is the duty of ministers of the gospel to purify our souls, that they may be <em>chaste virgins to Christ; </em>otherwise they accomplish nothing. Now we may understand it as meaning, that they individually present themselves as<em>chaste virgins to Christ, </em>or that the minister presents the whole of the people, and brings them forward into Christ’s presence. I approve rather of the second interpretation. Hence I have given a different rendering from Erasmus. <span class="cite-ref">(801)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(796)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vne equalite et moderation</span>;” — “An evenness and moderation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(797)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De laquelle nous sommes esmeus pour l’amour de nostre Dieu</span>;” — “By which we are influenced out of love to our God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(798)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et les faire perseuerer en saincte conionction auec luy</span>;” — “And to lead them to persevere in holy connection with him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(799)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quiconque est froid et lasche</span>;” — “Whoever is cold and indolent.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(800)</span> “Paranymphos;” — “Friends of the bridegroom.” The reader will find the office and duties of <em>paranymph </em>detailed at considerable length by <em>Dr. Adam Clarke, </em>when commenting on <span class="bvs">Joh_3:29</span> — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(801)</span> The rendering of Erasmus, as stated by Beza, (who, like Calvin, disapproves of it,) is “ut exhiberctis;” — “that <em>ye </em>may present.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
