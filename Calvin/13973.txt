<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Thou hast given more joy to my heart. </em>By another comparison he better expresses and illustrates the strength of his affection, showing that, having obtained the good which he had longed for, he does not in the least degree envy the wealth and enjoyments of others, but is altogether contented with his own lot. The sum is, that he had more satisfaction in seeing the reconciled countenance of God beaming upon him, than if he had possessed garners full of corn, and cellars full of wine. <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> Interpreters are not agreed as to the word <span class="lang he-il">מעת</span><em>, me-eth, </em>which we have translated, <em>in the time. </em>Some give this rendering, <em>Thou hast put gladness into my heart, </em>Since The Time <em>that their corn and wine increased; </em>as if David had said, I rejoice when I see mine enemies prospering in the world. <span class="cite-ref">(62)</span> But the former translation appears to me much more suitable; according to which David declares, that he rejoices more in the favor of God alone, than earthly men rejoice when they enjoy all earthly good things, with the desire of which they are generally inflamed. He had represented them as so bent upon, and addicted to, the pursuit of worldly prosperity, as to have no great care about God; and now he adds, that their joy in the abundance and increase of their wine and corn is not so great as is his joy in a sense of the divine goodness alone. This verse contains very profitable instruction. We see how earthly men, after they have despised the grace of God, and plunged themselves over head and ears in transitory pleasures, are so far from being satisfied with them, that the very abundance of them inflames their desires the more; and thus, in the midst of their fullness, a secret uneasiness renders their minds uncomfortable. Never, therefore, shall we obtain undisturbed peace and solid joy until the favor of God shine upon us. And although the faithful also desire and seek after their worldly comforts, yet they do not pursue them with immoderate and irregular ardor; but can patiently bear to be deprived of them, provided they know themselves to be the objects of the divine care. </p><p><strong>(61)</strong> The allusion is to the joy of the harvest and vintage. </p><p><strong>(62)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Or combien que les expositeurs varient en ce mot que nous avons traduit, Au temps: pource qu’aucuns traduisent, Tu m’as donne liesse au coeur depuis le temps que, etc., comme s’il disoit, Je suis joyeux quand je voy prosperer mes ennemis en ce monde</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p></div>
