Thus they conceive the prolonged exile of the people is indicated. Undoubtedly it was the purpose of the Spirit to shew, by way of correction, that their prosperity, which had been previously mentioned, should be mixed with heavy afflictions: for slavery is a bitter thing, and exile even worse. Hence we gather that, though the Church is blessed by God, it is still in such a way as that it shall not cease to be exposed to various calamities. The interrogation, therefore, will be most appropriate. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(180)</span> It will be seen that the <em>A. V. </em>renders the clause interrogatively in the margin, though with a slight difference from the sense of <em>C. </em></p></div></div>
