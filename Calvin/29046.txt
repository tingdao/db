<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Since ye seek a proof </em>A twofold meaning may be drawn from these words. The <em>first </em>is, “Since you wish to try me, whether I speak of myself, or whether Christ speaks by me;<em>” </em>and in this way Chrysostom, and Ambrose, explain it. I am rather inclined, however, to understand him as declaring, that it does not so much concern himself as Christ, when his authority is detracted from — that when his admonitions are despised, Christ’s patience is tried. “It is Christ that speaks by me; when therefore, you bring my doctrine under your lash, it is not so much to me as to him that you do injury.” </p><p>Some one, however, will object thus: “What! Will a man’s doctrine, then, be exempted from all investigation, so soon as he makes it his boast, that he has Christ as his authority? And what false prophet will not make this his boast? What distinction, then, will there be between truth and falsehood, and what will, in that case, become of that injunction: </p><p>Try the spirits, whether they are of God.” (<span class="bvs">1Jo_4:1</span>.) </p><p>Every objection of this nature Paul anticipates, when he says that Christ has wrought efficaciously in them by his ministry. For these two clauses, <em>Christ speaking in me, </em>and, <em>who is mighty in you, not weak, </em>must be read in connection, in this sense: “Christ, by exercising his power towards you in my doctrine, has declared that he spoke by my mouth, so that you have no excuse on the ground of ignorance.” </p><p>We see, that he does not merely boast in words, but proves in reality that Christ speaks in him, and he convinces the Corinthians, before requiring them to give him credit. Whoever, then, will speak in the Church, whatever be the title that he claims for himself, it will be allowable to inquire as to his doctrine, until Christ has manifested himself in him, and thus it will not be of Christ that judgment will be formed, but of the man. When, however, it is apparent, that it is the word of God that is advanced, what Paul says holds good — that it is God himself who is not believed <span class="cite-ref">(947)</span> Moses spake with the same confidence. (<span class="bvs">Num_16:11</span>.) </p><p>What are we — I and Aaron? You are tempting God. </p><p>In like manner, Isaiah: </p><p>Is it too small a thing that you grieve men,<LineBreak />unless you grieve my God also? (<span class="bvs">Isa_7:13</span>.) </p><p>For there is no more room for shuffling, when it has been made apparent, that it is a minister of God that speaks, and that he discharges his office faithfully. I return to Paul. As the confirmation of his ministry had been so decided among the Corinthians, inasmuch as the Lord had shown himself openly, it is not to be wondered, if he takes it so much amiss, that he meets with resistance. On good grounds, truly, <span class="cite-ref">(948)</span> might he throw back upon them, as he does, the reproach, that they were rebels against Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(947)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Que si on ne la recoit, cest oster a Dieu son authorite</span>;” — “That if this is not received, that is to take from God the authority, which belongs to him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(948)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Tant y a qu’il auoit bonne occasion et droict</span>;” — “To such an extent had he good occasion and right.” </p></div></div>
