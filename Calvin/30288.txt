The doer here is not the same as in <span class="bvs">Rom_2:13</span>, who satisfied the law of God and fulfilled it in every part, but the doer is he who from the heart embraces God’s word and testifies by his life that he really believes, according to the saying of Christ, </p><p>“Blessed are they who hear God’s word and keep it,”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Luk_11:28</span>;) </p><p>for he shews by the fruits what that implanting is, before mentioned. We must further observe, that faith with all its works is included by James, yea, faith especially, as it is the chief work which God requires from us. The import of the whole is, that we ought to labor that the word of the Lord should strike root in us, so that it may afterwards fructify. <span class="cite-ref">(110)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(110)</span><em>Calvin </em>takes no notice of the last sentence, “deceiving yourselves.” The participle means deceiving by false reasoning.; it may be rendered with <em>Doddridge</em>, “sophistically deceiving yourselves.” </p></div></div>
