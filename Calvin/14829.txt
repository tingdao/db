<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Nevertheless, my soul is silent towards God. </em>Should the translation I have followed be adopted, the psalm is to be considered as beginning abruptly, in the usual style of compositions of an impassioned kind. <span class="cite-ref">(409)</span> Of this we have an instance in <span class="bvs">Psa_73:0</span>, where the prophet, who had been agitated with doubts, as we shall see more particularly afterwards, suddenly brings his mind to a fixed decision, and, in the way of cutting off all further subject of debate, exclaims, “Yet God is good to Israel.” And so it is, I conceive, in the psalm before us. We know that the Lord’s people cannot always reach such a measure of composure as to be wholly exempt from distraction. They would wish to receive the word of the Lord with submission, and to be dumb under his correcting hand; but inordinate affections will take possession of their minds, and break in upon that peace which they might otherwise attain to in the exercise of faith and resignation. Hence the impatience we find in many; an impatience which they give vent to in the presence of God, and which is an occasion to themselves of much trouble and disquietude. The Hebrew particle <span class="lang he-il">אך</span><em>, ach, </em>is often used in an exclusive sense, and has been rendered by some, <em>only; </em>it is also employed in an affirmative sense, and has been rendered <em>truly, </em>or <em>certainly. </em>But in order to arrive at its full meaning, we must suppose that David felt an inward struggle and opposition, which he found it necessary to check. Satan had raised a tumult in his affections, and wrought a degree of impatience in his mind, which he now curbs; and he expresses his resolution <em>to be silent. </em><span class="cite-ref">(410)</span> The word implies a meek and submissive endurance of the cross. It expresses the opposite of that heat of spirit which would put us into a posture of resistance to God. The silence intended is, in short, that composed submission of the believer, in the exercise of which he acquiesces in the promises of God, gives place to his word, bows to his sovereignty, and suppresses every inward murmur of dissatisfaction. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">דומיה</span><em>, dumiyah, </em>which I have rendered <em>is silent, </em>some consider to be the noun; and it is of little consequence which translation we adopt. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(409)</span> “Sicuti patheticae sententiae ut plurimum defectivae sunt.” — <em>Lat</em>. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme nous scavons que les propos dits de quelque affection vehemente, le plus souvent sont imparfaits</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(410)</span> The import of the Hebrew word is “patient silence.” The Septuagint reads, “<span class="lang el-gr">Ουχι τῶ Θεῶ ὑποταγήσεται ἡ ψυχή μου</span> ? “Shall not my soul be subject to God?” And doubtless the Psalmist intended to say that his soul was quiet, submissive, and subject; the rebellious affections being tamed and subdued. With respect to the translation of our English Bible, “Truly my soul waiteth upon God,” Dr Adam Clarke remarks, “I do not think that the original will warrant this translation.” He reads, “Surely to God only is my soul dumb;” which he thus explains: “I am subject to God Almighty. He has a right to lay on me what He pleases; and what He lays on me is much less than I deserve; therefore am <em>I dumb </em>before God. The Vulgate, and, almost all the versions, have understood it in this sense: ‘Nonne Deo subjecta erit anima mea ? Shall not my soul be subject to God?’” With this agree the version and interpretation of Calvin. </p></div></div>
