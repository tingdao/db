To this purpose serveth that also, that God did beautify the tabernacle with divers miracles; for the worthiness thereof <span class="cite-ref">(462)</span> was established by those victories which the Jews had gotten, as it appeareth by divers places of the holy history; therefore, it must needs be that they were very disobedient, which did not cease oftentimes to start aside from that worship which was so many ways approved. </p><p><em>Until the days of David. </em>Although the ark of the Lord continued long in Shiloh, yet it had no certain place until the reign of David, (<span class="bvs">1Sa_1:3</span>;) for it was unlawful for men to erect a place for the same, but it was to be placed in that place which the Lord had showed, as Moses saith oftentimes.
