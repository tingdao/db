<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>That ye put off. </em>He demands from a Christian man repentance, or a new life, which he makes to consist of self-denial and the regeneration of the Holy Spirit. Beginning with the first, he enjoins us to lay aside, or <em>put off </em>the old man, employing the metaphor of garments, which we have already had occasion to explain. <em>The old man, </em>— as we have repeatedly stated, in expounding the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, and other passages where it occurs, — means the natural disposition which we bring with us from our mother’s womb. In two persons, Adam and Christ, he describes to us what may be called two natures. As we are first born of Adam, the depravity of nature which we derive from him is called the <em>Old </em>man; and as we are born again in Christ, the amendment of this sinful nature is called the <em>New </em>man. In a word, he who desires to put off the old man must renounce his nature. To suppose that the words <em>Old </em>and<em>New </em>contain an allusion to the Old and New Testaments, is exceedingly unphilosophical. </p><p><em>Concerning the former conversation. </em>To make it more evident that this exhortation to the Ephesians was not unnecessary, he reminds them of their former life. “Before Christ revealed himself to your minds, the old man reigned in you; and therefore, if you desire to lay him aside, you must renounce your former life.” <em>Which is corrupted. </em>He describes the old man from the fruits, that is, from the wicked desires, which allure men to destruction; for the word, <em>corrupt, </em>alludes to old age, which is closely allied to corruption. Let us beware of considering <em>the deceitful lusts, </em>as the Papists do, to mean nothing more than the gross and visible lusts, which are generally acknowledged to be base. The word includes also those dispositions which, instead of being censured, are sometimes applauded, — such as ambition, cunning, and everything that proceeds either from self-love or from want of confidence in God. </p></div>
