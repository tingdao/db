<div class="comment-content"><p>But the next verse must be joined, <em>For Jehovah of hosts, who hath planted thee, etc.</em>; as though he had said, “Your beauty and whatever that is valuable in you, is it from you? Surely, all your dignity and excellency have proceeded from the gratuitous kindness of God: know ye then that nothing comes from you, but from God and from his good pleasure. Then Jehovah, who has planted you, can, when he pleases, pull up by the roots a tree which he has himself planted.” </p><p>He says that it was a <em>green olive, fair in fruit and form </em>How so? Because God had favored them with much honor. This similitude is found in many other places, but yet it is various as to its meaning. It might indeed with regard to God’s dealings be applied to the whole people; but as hypocrites deserved to be spoiled and stripped of their privileges, so that which was offered to all in common, could only be really applied to the faithful, according to what David says, </p><p>“I am a fruitful olive in the house of God.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_52:8</span>) </p><p>He then no doubt separated himself from hypocrites, as though he had said, “Even hypocrites seek to have a place in God’s Temple, and are as it were tall trees, but they are unfruitful: I shall then be a green olive in the house of God; but they will wither.” But the Prophet, as I have said, compares the Jews to a green olive on account of their adoption and the free favor shewn to them; for God had raised them unto a high state of excellency and honor. </p><p>But after having thus spoken by way of concession, he then adds, <em>At the sound of a great tumult, </em>or of a great word, <em>he will kindle his fire upon it, and broken shall be its branches </em>Some, as I have said, render the last clause, “and they have broken its branches.” As to what is intended, there is nothing dubious; but if we take the verb in an active sense, something must be understood, that is, that enemies, who will be like fire, shall break its branches. <span class="cite-ref">(46)</span> Then follows what I have said to be a confirmation, — that <em>Jehovah, who had planted it, had spoken of </em>or pronounced <em>an evil, </em>or a calamity <em>against it. </em>He thus shews that there was no reason for them to trust in their present beauty; for they had it not from themselves, but possessed it only at the will of another; for God who had planted them, could also destroy them. But on this subject more shall be said. </p><p><strong>(46)</strong> This clause is difficult. The versions give no assistance. The word <span class="lang he-il">המולה</span>, or rather <span class="lang he-il">המלה</span>, is rendered <em>“circumcision” </em>by the <em>Septuagint, “speech’ </em>by the <em>Vulgate, “decree” </em>by the <em>Syriac, “tumult” </em>by our version, and clamor by <em>Blayney. </em>It occurs only in one other place, <span class="bvs">Eze_1:24</span>; where it stands in apposition with the <em>“voice </em>of the Almighty,” which means there, and often elsewhere, “thunder:” and its meaning there is evidently the breaking of thunder or the thunderclap. It comes from <span class="lang he-il">מל</span>, to cut, to break, to shiver. Then the noun is literally breaking, or crashing; it is the bursting noise of thunder. The other difficulty is <span class="lang he-il">עליה</span>, rendered “upon it” in our version as well as in the early versions: but “it” is feminine in Hebrew, and “of it” after branches is masculine, the same gender with “olive.” None have accounted for this anomaly. <em>Blayney </em>has indeed made the word a participle to agree with<em>fire, </em>— “a fire mounting upwards;” but this can hardly be admitted. I would render the verse thus, — </p><p>An olive, flourishing, beautiful in fruit, in form, Hath Jehovah called thy name: At the sound of a great thunderclap, — Kindled hath he a fire by it; And shivered have been its branches. </p><p>The verb for “kindled” is in Hiphil, and “by it” is the “thunderclap,” which is feminine, and “its” is the “olive,” which is masculine. <em>Houbigant </em>refers this passage to thunder. </p><p>The past tense is used for the future. He compares the nation to a flourishing tree, and then he speaks of its destruction by a fire kindled by the breaking of a thunder: the fire is the lightning. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
