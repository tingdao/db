<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>To hear the groaning of the prisoner </em>Here the prophet repeats once more what he had previously touched upon concerning prayer, in order again to stir up the hearts of the godly to engage in that exercise, and that after their deliverance they might know it to have been granted to their faith, because, depending on the divine promises, they had sent up their groanings to heaven. He calls them <em>prisoners; </em>for although they were not bound in fetters, their captivity resembled a most rigorous imprisonment. Yea, he affirms a little after <em>that they were devoted to death, </em>to give them to understand that their life and safety would have been altogether hopeless, had they not been delivered from death by the extraordinary power of God. </p></div>
