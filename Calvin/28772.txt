<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>54.</strong><em>Then shall be brought to pass the saying </em>This is not merely an amplification, <em>( </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἐπεξεργασία</span><em>,) </em><span class="cite-ref">(137)</span> but a confirmation, too, of the preceding statement. For what was foretold by the Prophets must be fulfilled. Now this prediction will not be fulfilled, until our bodies, laying aside corruption, will <em>put on incorruption </em>Hence this last result, also, is necessary. To <em>come to pass, </em>is used here in the sense of being <em>fully accomplished, </em>for what Paul quotes is now begun in us, and is daily, too, receiving further accomplishment; but it will not have its complete fulfillment until the last day. </p><p>It does not, however, appear quite manifest, from what passage he has taken this quotation, for many statements occur in the Prophets to this effect. Only the probability is, that the first clause is taken either from <span class="bvs">Isa_25:8</span>, where it is said that <em>death will be for ever destroyed </em>by the Lord, <span class="cite-ref">(138)</span> or, (as almost all are rather inclined to think,) from <span class="bvs">Hos_13:14</span>, where the Prophet, bewailing the obstinate wickedness of Israel, complains that he was like an untimely child, that struggles against the efforts of his mother in travail, that he may not <em>come </em>forth from the womb, and from this he concludes, that it was owing entirely to himself, that he was not delivered from death. <em>I will ransom them, </em>says he, from <em>the power of the grave: I will rescue them from death. </em>It matters not, whether you read these words in the future of the indicative, or in the subjunctive <span class="cite-ref">(139)</span> for in either way the meaning amounts to this — that God was prepared to confer upon them salvation, if they would have allowed the favor to be conferred upon them, and that, therefore, if they perished, it was their own fault. </p><p>He afterwards adds,<em>I will be thy destruction, O death! thy ruin, O grave! </em>In these words God intimates, that he accomplishes the salvation of his people <span class="cite-ref">(140)</span> only when death and the grave are reduced to nothing. For no one will deny, that in that passage there is a description of completed salvation. As, therefore, we do not see such a destruction of death, it follows, that we do not yet enjoy that complete salvation, which God promises to his people, and that, consequently, it is delayed until <em>that day. Then, </em>accordingly, <em>will death be swallowed up, </em>that is, it will be reduced to nothing, <span class="cite-ref">(141)</span> that we may have manifestly, in every particular, and in every respect, (as they say,) a complete victory over it. <span class="cite-ref">(142)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(137)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vne declaration ou amplification</span>;” — “A declaration or amplification.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(138)</span> “The words, as alleged by Paul,” (from <span class="bvs">Isa_25:8</span>,) “are found in the version of Theodotion, with which the Targum and Syriac agree, in reading the verb as a passive, <span class="lang he-il">כלע</span> in Piel, as here, commonly signifies to destroy, <em>destroy utterly; </em>in Kal, the more usual signification is that of <em>swallowing, </em>which most of the versions have unhappily adopted, <span class="lang he-il">לנצח</span> the Greek translators render by; <span class="lang el-gr">ἰσχύσας, εἰς τέλος, εἰς νῖκος</span>; attaching to the term the idea of what is <em>overpowering, durable, complete. </em>The significations of the Hebrew root <span class="lang he-il">נצח</span>, used only in Niphal and Piel, are — to <em>shine, lead, lead on, be complete; </em>in Chald. to <em>surpass; excel, vanquish; </em>hence the idea of <em>victory, eternity, etc.</em>, attaching to <span class="lang he-il">נצח</span>, and of <em>completely, entirely, for ever, </em>etc., to <span class="lang he-il">לנצח נצח</span>. The words are therefore equivalent <em>to </em><span class="lang el-gr">ὁ θάνατος ὀυκ ἐσται ἐτι</span> — <em>(Death shall be no longer,) </em><span class="bvs">Rev_21:4</span>, where there seems to be an evident allusion to our text; and where the subject is, as here, not the millennial state of the Church, but the state of glory after the resurrection of the body. It will be then only, that a period shall be put to the reproachful persecutions of the righteous, which Isaiah likewise <em>predicts.” </em>— <em>Henderson </em>on Isaiah. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(139)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ie les eusse rachetez — ie les eusse deliurez</span>;” — “I could have ransomed them — I could have rescued them.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(140)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lors vrayement et a bon escient il sauue les fideles</span>;” — “He then truly and effectually saves believers.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(141)</span> “This victory will not be gradual only, but total and entire. Every thing of mortality, that was hanging about these glorious victors, shall be <em>swallowed up </em>in perfect and endless life. Death is unstung first — disarmed — and then easily overcome. Its sting is said to be sin — the deadliest thing in death. A plain farther proof, by the way, the Apostle intended death also in the moral sense. And the insulting inquiry, ‘where is it?’ implies ‘tis not any where to be found; and signifies a total abolition of it, and, by consequence, must infer that every thing of death besides must, as to them, for ever cease and be no more. Which also the phrase of <em>swallowing up </em>doth with great emphasis <em>express.” </em>— <em>Howe’s </em>Works, (Lond. 1834,) page 1035. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(142)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En sorte que nons aurons plene et parfaite victoire a Pencontre d’elle</span>;<em>” </em>— <em>“ </em>So that we shall have a full and complete victory over it.” </p></div></div>
