<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah proceeds with what he touched upon in the last verse, even that the Lord, after having chastised his people, would at length shew mercy to them, so as to receive them into favor. He says, in short, that their captivity would not be perpetual. But we must remember what we have before stated, that is, that deliverance is only promised to the faithful, who would patiently and resignedly submit to God and not disregard his paternal correction. If, then, we desire God to be propitious to us, we must suffer ourselves to be paternally chastised by him; for if we resist when goaded, no pardon can by any means be expected, for we then, as it were, wilfully provoke God by our hardness. </p><p>He therefore says, <em>in that day, </em>that is, when the appointed time was completed. The false prophets inflamed the people with false expectation, as though their deliverance was to take place after two years. God bade the faithful to wait, and not to be thus in a hurry; he had assigned a day for them, and that was, as we have seen, the seventieth year. He then mentions the <em>yoke, </em>that is, of the king of Babylon, and taking another view, <em>the chains </em>The yoke was what Nebuchadnezzar laid on the Jews; and the chains of the people were those by which Nebuchadnezzar had bound them. At last he adds, <em>And rule over them shall no more strangers </em>The verb <span class="lang he-il">עבד</span>, <em>obed, </em>is to be taken here in a causative sense; even the form of the sentence shews this, and they who render the words, “and strangers shall not serve them,” wrest the meaning; for it could not be a promise; and this is inconsistent with the context, and requires no confutation, as it is evidently unsuitable. If the verb be taken in the sense of serving, then “strangers” must be in the dative case. We have seen before a similar phrase in <span class="bvs">Jer_25:14</span>, where the Prophet says that neither kings nor strong nations would any longer rule over the Jews. The same verb is used, and the same form of expression. <em>Strangers, </em>then, <em>shall make them serve no more; </em>that is, they shall not rule over them so as slavishly to oppress them. <span class="cite-ref">(4)</span></p><p>We now perceive the design of the Prophet; he exhorts the Jews to patience, and shews that though their exile would be long, yet their deliverance was certain. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(4)</strong>   </p><p>I render the verse as follows, — </p><p><strong>8.</strong>And it shall be in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, <em>That </em>I shall break his yoke from thy neck, And thy chains will I burst: And make him to serve shall strangers no more: 9. But serve shall they Jehovah, etc.. </p><p>The transition from the second to the third person, “thy” and “him,” and from the singular to the plural, “him” and “they,” is very common in the Prophets. On the last line in the 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse (<span class="bvs">Jer_30:8</span>). — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
