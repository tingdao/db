<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Then they understood. </em>The word <em>leaven </em>is very evidently used by Christ as contrasted with the pure and uncorrupted word of God. In a former passage, (<span class="bvs">Mat_13:33</span>,) Christ had used the word in a good sense, when he said that the Gospel resembled <em>leaven; </em><span class="cite-ref">(434)</span> but for the most part this word is employed in Scripture to denote some foreign substance, by which the native purity of any thing is impaired. In this passage, the naked truth of God, and the inventions which men contrive out of their own brain, are unquestionably the two things that are contrasted. The sophist must not hope to escape by saying that this ought not to be understood as applicable to every kind of doctrine; for it will be impossible to find any doctrine but what has come from God that deserves the name of pure and <em>unleavened </em>Hence it follows that <em>leaven </em>is the name given to every foreign admixture; as Paul also tells us that faith is rendered spurious, as soon as we are </p><p>drawn aside from the simplicity of Christ, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Co_11:3</span>.) </p><p>It must now be apparent who are the persons of whose doctrine our Lord charges us to beware. The ordinary government of the Church was at that time in the hands of the scribes and priests, among whom the Pharisees held the highest rank. As Christ expressly charges his followers to beware of <em>their </em>doctrine, it follows that all who mingle their own inventions with the word of God, or who advance any thing that does not belong to it, must be rejected, how honorable soever may be their rank, or whatever proud titles they may wear. Accursed and rebellious, therefore, is the obedience of those who voluntarily submit to the inventions and laws of the Pope. </p><p><strong>(434)</strong> See page 127 of this volume. </p></div>
