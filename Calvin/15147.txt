<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>And he consumed their days in vanity. </em>As the Psalmist here speaks of the whole people, as if he had said, that all without exception were speedily consumed, from the least even to the greatest, this might with probability be referred to that most grievous punishment which was confirmed and ratified by the wrath of God — that they should all perish in the wilderness with only two exceptions, Joshua and Caleb; because, when already near the land of Canaan, they had turned back. That vast multitude, therefore, after they had shut against themselves the door of entrance into the Holy Land, died in the wilderness during the course of forty years. <em>Days </em>are put in the first place, and then <em>years; </em>by which it is intimated, that the duration of their life was cut short by the curse of God, and that it was quite apparent that they failed in the midst of their course. <em>Their days </em>then were consumed <em>in vanity; </em>for they vanished away like smoke: and <em>their years in haste, </em>because they passed swiftly away like a stream. The word <span class="lang he-il">בהלה</span>, <em>behalah, </em>here translated <em>haste, </em>is by some rendered <em>terror. </em>I would rather prefer reading <em>tumult; </em>for it is undoubtedly meant that their life was taken away, as when in a tumult any thing is taken by force. <span class="cite-ref">(338)</span> But I would not be disposed to change the word <em>haste, </em>which brings out the meaning more perspicuously. It was a display of righteous retribution, on account of their obstinacy, that their strength which made them proud, thus withered and vanished all on a sudden as a shadow. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(338)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que leur vie a este emportee comme quand en tumulte on ravit quelque chose</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
