<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>I will praise thee with my whole heart </em>As David had been honored to receive distinguishing marks of the divine favor, he declares his resolution to show more than ordinary gratitude. This is exercise which degenerates and is degraded in the case of hypocrites to a mere sound of empty words, but he states that he would return thanks to God not with the lips only, but with sincerity of heart, for by the <em>whole heart, </em>as we have elsewhere seen, is meant a heart which is sincere and not double. The noun <span class="lang he-il">אלהים</span>, <em>Elohim, </em>sometimes means <em>angels, </em>and sometimes <em>kings, </em>and either meaning will suit with the passage before us. The praise David speaks of is that which is of a public kind. The solemn assembly is, so to speak, a heavenly theater, graced by the presence of attending angels; and one reason why the cherubim overshadowed the Ark of the Covenant was to let God’s people know that the angels are present when they come to worship in the sanctuary. We might very properly apply what is said here to <em>kings, </em>on account of their eminence in rank, as in <span class="bvs">Psa_107:32</span>, “Praise ye the Lord in the assembly of the elders” — that is, as we should say, in an assembly of an honored and illustrious kind. But I prefer the former sense, and this because believers in drawing near to God are withdrawn from the world, and rise to heaven in the enjoyment of fellowship with angels, so that we find Paul enforcing his address to the Corinthians upon the necessity of decency and order, by requiring them to show some respect at least in their public religious assemblies to the angels. (<span class="bvs">1Co_11:10</span>.) The same thing was represented by God long before, under the figure of the cherubim, thus giving his people a visible pledge of his presence. </p></div>
