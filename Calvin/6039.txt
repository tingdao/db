<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And it came to pass when all the kings, </em>etc. As the arrival of the people was well known to these kings from the very first, it is certain that their minds were intoxicated from above with security or lethargy, so that they did not forthwith league together to oppose them. It implied excessive stupor not to provide for themselves till they were violently roused to exertion by the overthrow of two cities. <span class="cite-ref">(80)</span> For as the war was common, it was a kind of voluntary surrender to send no aid to their neighbors, nay, to have no army ready, which might make a powerful impression for their defense. But in this way God spared the weakness of his people, to whom the combined forces of so many nations would have caused no small fear. </p><p>It is certain, then, that by the sloth and torpor of their enemies, the Israelites were rendered more expeditious. For an interval was, in the meanwhile, given them to compose themselves, and thus those whom the mere name of enemies might have alarmed, prepare leisurely to encounter them. <span class="cite-ref">(81)</span> In the same way, although the reprobate are desirous, by every possible device, to destroy the Church, God, to take away their power of hurting her, scatters and confounds their counsels, nay, destroys their spirit. <span class="cite-ref">(82)</span> On the other hand, these nations display their frantic audacity. Instead of being overcome by manifest miracle, they continue to rage like wild beasts against the unassailable power of God. A report of the taking of Jericho had reached them. Had it been overthrown by the counsel, or the acting, or the prowess, or the engines of men? Nay, the walls had fallen of their own accord. With what confidence then can they league to take up arms against heaven? </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(80)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car c’estoit une stupidite par trop grande de ne se point tenir sur ses gardes, jusqu’a tant quils fussent resveillez comme par force de leur paresse oyans la ruine et le sac de deux villes</span>;” “For it implied excessive stupidity not to stand upon their guard, until they were awakened, as if by force, from their indolence, on hearing of the run and sacking of two towns.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(81)</span> To encounter them.” Latin, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ad eos excipiendos</span>.” French, “To give them a good reception, and repulse them bravely.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(82)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Dissippe et renverse leur conseils, entreprises, et machinations: et mesme il leur oste le sens et l’entendement</span>;” “Dissipates and overturns their counsels, enterprises, and machinations; and even deprives them of sense and understanding.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
