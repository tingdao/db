<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>After that the angels departed </em>Here is described to us the obedience of the shepherds. The Lord had made them the witnesses of his Son to the whole world. What he had spoken to them by his angels was efficacious, and was not suffered to pass away. They were not plainly and expressly commanded to come to Bethlehem; but, being sufficiently aware that such was the design of God, they hasten to see Christ. In the same manner, we know that Christ is held out to us, in order that our hearts may approach him by faith; and our delay in coming admits of no excuse. <span class="cite-ref">(166)</span> But again, Luke informs us, that the shepherds resolved to set out, immediately after the angels had departed. This conveys an important lesson. Instead of allowing the word of God, as many do, to pass away with the sound, we must take care that it strike its roots deep in us, and manifest its power, as soon as the sound has died away upon our ears. It deserves our attention, also, that the shepherds exhort one another: for it is not enough that each of us is attentive to his own duty, if we do not give mutual exhortations. Their obedience is still farther commended by the statement of Luke, that they <em>hastened, </em>(ver. 16;) for we are required to show the readiness of faith. </p><p><em>Which the Lord hath revealed to us </em>They had only heard it from the angel; but they intentionally and correctly say, that <em>the Lord had revealed </em>it to them; for they consider the messenger of God to possess the same authority as if the Lord himself had addressed them. For this reason, the Lord directs our attention to himself; that we may not fix our view on men, and undervalue the authority of his Word. We see also that they reckon themselves under obligation, not to neglect the treasure which the Lord had pointed out to them; for they conclude that, immediately after receiving this intelligence, they must go to Bethlehem to see it. In the same manner, every one of us, according to the measure of his faith and understanding, ought to be prepared to follow wheresoever God calls. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(166)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si nous sommes paresseux de le faire, toutes les excuses du monde ne nous serviront de rien</span>.” — “If we are indolent in doing so, all the apologies in the world will be of no service to us.” </p></div></div>
