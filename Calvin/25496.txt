<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_12:36</span><strong>.</strong><em>And you yourselves like men that wait for their master. </em>He uses another parable not mentioned by Matthew, who writes more briefly on this subject; for he compares himself to <em>a householder </em>who, while he is joining in the festivities of the marriage feast, or in other respects indulging in pleasure, out of his own house, wishes <em>his servants </em>to conduct themselves with modesty and sobriety at home, attending to their lawful occupations, and diligently waiting for his return. Now though the Son of God has departed to the blessed rest of heaven, and is absent from us, yet as he has assigned to every one his duty, it would be improper for us to give way to indolent repose. Besides, as he has promised that he will return to us, we ought to hold ourselves prepared, at every moment, to receive him, that he may not find <em>us sleeping. </em>For if a mortal man looks upon it as a duty which <em>his servants </em>owe him, that, <em>at whatever hour he returns home, </em>they shall be prepared to receive him, how much more has he a right to demand from his followers that they shall be sober and vigilant, and always wait for his coming? To excite them to greater alacrity, he mentions that earthly masters are so delighted with such promptitude on the part of their servants, that they even <em>serve them; </em>not that all <em>masters </em>are accustomed to act in this manner, but because it does sometimes happen that a <em>master, </em>who is kind and gentle, admits his <em>servants </em>to his own table, as if they were his companions. </p><p>Yet it may be asked, Since Scripture calls us in many passages <em>children of light, </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_5:8</span>; <span class="bvs">1Th_5:5</span>,) and since the Lord also shines upon us by his word, so that we walk as at noon, how does the Lord compare our life to the watches of tire night? But we ought to seek the solution of this difficulty from the words of Peter, who tells us, that the word of God shines like a burning lamp, to enable us distinctly to see our road in a dark place. We ought therefore to attend. to both statements, that our journey must be performed amidst the thick darkness of the world, and yet we are protected from the risk of going astray, while the torch of heavenly doctrine goes before us, more especially when we have Christ himself for a sun. </p></div>
