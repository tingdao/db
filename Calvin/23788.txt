<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>And his disciples, when they heard these things, were greatly amazed. The disciples are astonished, </em>because it ought to awaken in us no little anxiety, that <em>riches </em>obstruct the <em>entrance into the kingdom of God; </em>for, wherever we turn our eyes, a thousand obstacles will present themselves. But let us observe that, while they were struck with astonishment, they did not shrink from the doctrines of Christ. The case was different with him who was lately mentioned; for he was so much alarmed by the severity of the commandment, that he separated from Christ; while they, though trembling, and inquiring<em>, who can be saved? </em>do not break off in an opposite direction, but are desirous to conquer despair. Thus it will be of service to us to tremble at the threatenings of God: whenever he denounces any thing that is gloomy or dreadful, provided that our minds are not discouraged, but rather aroused. </p></div>
