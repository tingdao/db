<div class="comment-content"><p>The first clause may be explained in two ways: The view commonly taken is, that it ought to be ascribed to God’s mercy that the faithful have not been often consumed. Hence a very useful doctrine is elicited — that God succors his own people, lest they should wholly perish. But if we attend to the context, we shall see that another sense is more suitable, even that the <em>mercies of God were not consumed, and that his compassion’s had not failed </em>The particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>,<em>ki, </em>is inserted, but ought to be taken as an affirmative only, <em>surely the mercies of God are not consumed; </em><span class="cite-ref">(183)</span> and then, — surely his compassion’s have not failed. And he afterwards adds, — </p><p><strong>(183)</strong> So the Targ. and all the versions, except the Vulg; they read <span class="lang he-il">תמו</span>. “The mercies of Jehovah” is the nominative case absolute, — </p><p>  </p><p><strong>22.</strong>The mercies of Jehovah, verily they have no end, <LineBreak />For his compassion’s never fail. </p><p><strong>23.</strong>Renewed (are they) in the morning; <LineBreak />Great is thy faithfulness. </p><p>“Renewed” refers to “mercies,” i.e., blessings, the fruit of mercy; and God’s mercies have no end, because his compassion’s ever continue. “In the morning,” that is, after a night of affliction. If the rendering be made literal, “in the mornings,” the meaning is the same; they follow the previous nights of trouble. Blessings, being as it were suspended or withheld during the night, are again renewed in the morning. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
