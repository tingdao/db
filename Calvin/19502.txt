<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah introduces another mark by which the false prophets might be known as different from the true prophets, — they flattered the ungodly and wicked despisers of God. He thus repeats what he had before said, that they strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that they became hardened in their impiety, and threw aside every care for repentance. Though he uses different words, yet the meaning is the same, that they <em>promised peace, </em>or prosperity, to the despisers of God, for the word <span class="lang he-il">שלום</span>, <em>shalum, </em>means to live well or happily. </p><p><em>They say, </em>then, <em>to those who despise </em>or reject me; for <span class="lang he-il">נאף</span>, <em>nats, </em>means both. The doubling of the word for “saying,” is also emphatical, <span class="lang he-il">אמרים אמור</span>, <em>amrim amur: </em><span class="cite-ref">(96)</span> for we know with how much haughtiness and confidence the false prophets dared to announce their dreams; for they were led by the spirit of pride, as they were the children of Satan. Hence then was their confidence, so that they made their declarations as though they had come down from heaven. <em>They say, </em>then, <em>by saying; </em>that is, they promise, and that with great effrontery, that peace would be to all the despisers of God; and not only so, but they pretended God’s name, <em>Spoken, has Jehovah </em><span class="cite-ref">(97)</span> They wished to be deemed the instruments or agents of the Holy Spirit, while they were vainly announcing, as it has been said, their own imaginations. And hence Jeremiah applied to them, though improperly, the word <em>vision, They speak the vision of their own heart </em>By using this word he makes a concession; for he might have said only, that they adduced nothing but trifles, even the falsehoods which they themselves had devised, but he mentions the word <span class="lang he-il">חזון</span>, <em>chezun, </em>which in itself ought to be deemed of high import. And yet he means that they were only apes as prophets, when they prattled of visions and confidently declared that they brought forward the revelations of the Spirit. He then concedes to them, though improperly, that they saw visions; but what did they see? even that <em>Jehovah had spoken, Peace shall be to you </em></p><p>Then he says, <em>They promise to those who walk in the wickedness of their own heart, </em>that all things shall turn out well to them, No <em>evil shall come upon you; </em>as though he had said, “They promise impunity to all the wicked.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(96)</span> Some, as Venema and Blayney, think that <span class="lang he-il">אמרים</span> belongs to the preceding verse; but this would not consist with the Hebrew idiom, where a participle often precedes a verb in the future tense, but never follows it; nor is this countenanced by any of the Versions or the Targ. The words as they stand are indeed unusual; the probability is that <span class="lang he-il">אמור</span> should be <span class="lang he-il">אמרו</span>, and all the Versions give it as such, “they say.” Then it would be, “Saying they say;” which imports the boldness and the confidence of the false prophets; that is, “They boldly say.” — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(97)</span> There is a difference in the early versions as to this clause; it is connected in the Sept. and Arab. with the preceding, “They say to those who reject the word of the Lord,” etc., and Blayney has followed this arrangement. The Vulg., the Syr., and the Targ., take it as a separate clause, and render it as here. The Hebrew no doubt admits of either constructions, but the Lord appears to be the speaker, and therefore the latter construction ought to have the preference, — </p><p><span class="cite-note">17.</span>They boldly say to those who despise me, Spoken hath Jehovah, “Peace shall be to you;” </p><p>And to every one who walks in the resolutions of his own heart, They say, “Not come upon you shall evil.” This rendering also corresponds more with what is said in <span class="bvs">Jer_23:25</span>, that the prophets prophesied lies in God’s name. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
