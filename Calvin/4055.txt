<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>And Moses gat him into the camp. </em>Although, after the appointment of the Seventy, all betook themselves to their own stations and dwelling-places, yet there is no doubt but that they were all forewarned of the approaching miracle, so as to be universally attentive to the event, which is presently related. When it is said that it was “a wind of the Lord” which brought the quails, there was no other reason for this than that God might openly manifest that all things under heaven are subject to His dominion, and are ready to obey Him. He might, indeed, have created the quails at will <em>(nutu,) </em>just as He rained the manna from heaven; nor was it natural that by the force of the winds such an abundance of birds should be east, and heaped together in one place; but by using the aid of the wind He confirmed what is written in <span class="bvs">Psa_104:3</span>, that “He maketh the winds his messengers <span class="cite-ref">(35)</span> and they bear him on their wings;” because in their swiftness they rapidly bear His commandments from the east to the west. Now, although it is true in the abstract that the winds come from Him, so that they are only His breath, and that the air cannot be stirred in the slightest degree except at His will, still an extraordinary miracle is here specified, as before in the passage of the Red Sea. The Prophet in the Psalm goes further: </p><p>“He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven; and by his power he brought in the south wind,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_78:26</span>,) </p><p>in which words He signifies that the whole air was shaken, since the winds suddenly arose from different quarters, which covered the earth in all directions with an immense multitude of the birds. </p><p>When he says that the earth was filled “as it were a day’s journey,” I do not understand it as if the dead birds lay at so great a distance, but that they occupied such a space of ground in thick heaps, and, in fact, continuously. And this also we gather from the Psalm, where the Prophet says, that they fell “in the midst of their camp,” and were carried to their tents round about. (<span class="bvs">Psa_78:28</span>.) What is added, as to their being “two cubits high,” I do not interpret, as some do, <span class="cite-ref">(36)</span> that they did not fly above two cubits from the ground, so as to be more easily taken with the hand; but that there was such a mass of them, that every one might carry away as much as he would. For to this also do those magnificent descriptions in the Psalm relate, whereby the miracle is extolled: </p><p>“He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and leathered fowls, like as the sand of the sea.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_78:27</span>.) </p><p>But how “they spread them abroad — round about,” <span class="cite-ref">(37)</span> is not very clear to me; unless, perhaps, they were placed in cages or coops, and daily taken out for food. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(35)</span><em>A.V.</em>, “Who maketh his angels spirits.” See <em>C.’s </em>own translation and comment. — Cal.

We have here, then, the earliest indication of processes, the benefits resulting from which have become so diffused and familiar, that it costs an effort of recollection to recognize them as benefits. Yet many centuries have not elapsed since the Emperor Charles V. thought it became him to erect a statue to the man (G. Bukel) who found the secret of salting and barrelling herrings.” — Illustr.
