<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Neither murmur ye </em>Others understand this to be the murmuring that arose, when the twelve, who had been sent to spy out the land, disheartened, on their return, the minds of the people. But as that murmuring was not punished suddenly by any special chastisement from the Lord, but was simply followed by the infliction of this punishment — that all were excluded from the possession of the land, it is necessary to explain this passage otherwise. It was a most severe punishment, it is true, to be shut out from entering the land, <span class="cite-ref">(554)</span> but the words of Paul, when he says that they were<em>destroyed </em>by the <em>destroyer</em>, express another kind of chastisement. I refer it, accordingly, to the history, which is recorded in the sixteenth chapter of Numbers. [<span class="bvs">Num_16:1</span> ]. For when God had punished the pride of Korah and Abiram, the people raised a tumult against Moses and Aaron, as if they had been to blame for the punishment which the Lord had inflicted. This madness of the people God punished by sending down fire from heaven, which swallowed up many of them — upwards of fourteen thousand. It is, therefore, a striking and memorable token of God’s wrath against rebels and seditious persons, that murmur against him. </p><p>Those persons, it is true, <em>murmured </em>against Moses; but as they had no ground for insulting him, and had no occasion for being incensed against him, unless it was that he had faithfully discharged the duty which had been enjoined upon him by God, God himself was assailed by that murmuring. Let us, accordingly, bear in mind that we have to do with God, and not with men, if we rise up against the faithful ministers of God, and let us know that this audacity <span class="cite-ref">(555)</span> will not go unpunished. </p><p>By the <em>destroyer </em>you may understand the Angel, who executed the judgment of God. Now he sometimes employs the ministry of bad angels, sometimes of good, in punishing men, as appears from various passages of Scripture. As Paul here does not make a distinction between the one and the other, you may understand it of either. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(554)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De n’entrer point en la iouissance de la terre promise</span>;” — “Not to enter on the enjoyment of the promised land.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(555)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceste temerite outrecuidee</span>;” — “This presumptuous rashness.” </p></div></div>
