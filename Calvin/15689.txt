<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>And they sacrificed </em>The prophet here mentions one species of superstition which demonstrates the awful blindness of the people; their not hesitating to sacrifice their sons and daughters to devils. <span class="cite-ref">(269)</span> In applying such an abominable designation to the sin of the people, he means to exhibit it in more hateful colors. From this we learn that inconsiderate zeal is a flimsy pretext in favor of any act of devotion. For by how much the Jews were under the influence of burning zeal, by so much does the prophet convict them with being guilty of greater wickedness; because their madness carried them away to such a pitch of enthusiasm, that they did not spare even their own offspring. Were good intentions meritorious, as idolaters suppose, then indeed the laying aside of all natural affection in sacrificing their own children was a deed deserving of the highest praise. But when men act under the impulse of their own capricious humor, the more they occupy themselves with acts of external worship, the more do they increase their guilt. For what difference was there between Abraham and those persons of whom the prophet makes mention, but that the former, under the influence of faith, was ready to offer up his son, while the latter, carried away by the impulse of intemperate zeal, cast off all natural affection, and imbrued their hands in the blood of their own offspring. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(269)</span> “<span class="lang he-il">לשדים</span>, <em>to the devils. </em>This word is found only here and in <span class="bvs">Deu_32:17</span>, ‘They sacrificed unto <em>devils, </em>not to God,’ etc. Some persons derive it from <span class="lang he-il">שוד</span>, <em>to lay waste. </em>Michaelis, from an Arabic word, signifying <em>to be black. </em>Hengstenberg, from an Arabic word, signifying <em>to exercise lordship. </em>Whatever root may be the true one, there is no doubt that <span class="lang he-il">שדים</span> denotes false gods of some kind or another to which human sacrifices were offered ” — <em>Phillips. </em>That the Canaanites, and their descendants, the Carthaginians, as well as other heathen nations, sacrificed men, and even their dearest children, to appease their deities, is a fact established not only from the Sacred Writings, but also from profane history; and strange as it may seem, it is no less certain, that in this they were imitated by the Israelites, who offered their sons and daughters to the same false gods. Compare <span class="bvs">2Kg_16:3</span>; <span class="bvs">2Ch_28:3</span>. They had been expressly warned against this horrid practice, (<span class="bvs">Lev_18:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Deu_12:31</span>;) but so infatuated were they, and such is the desperate wickedness of the human heart and the power of Satan over men, that they frequently relapsed into it. Dr Adam Clarke translates the original word which Calvin renders <em>devils </em>by <em>demons. </em>“<em>Devil</em>, ” says he, “is never in Scripture used in the plural; there is but one <em>devil, </em>though there are many demons.” </p></div></div>
