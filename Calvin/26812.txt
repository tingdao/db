<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Immediately the coch crew. </em>The Evangelist mentions <em>the crowing of the coch, </em>in order to inform us, that Peter was warned by God at the very time; and for this reason the other Evangelists tell us, that <em>he then remembered the words of the Lord, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_26:75</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_14:72</span>,) though Luke relates that the mere <em>crowing of the cock </em>did not produce any effect on Peter, till Christ <em>looked at him, </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_22:61</span>.) Thus, when any person has once begun to fall through the suggestions of Satan, no voice, no sign, no warning, will bring him back, until the Lord himself cast his eyes upon him. </p></div>
