<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And Israel came into Egypt </em>The prophet does not rehearse the whole history, nor was this necessary. He only presents to our view how divine providence was concerned in it, which very few consider in reading the narrative of Moses. He accordingly declares, that after Joseph had been sent before into Egypt, to be the means of supporting his father and the whole family, Jacob then came into Egypt, that is, he did so when all things were admirably arranged, that he might find abundance of bread among a people, the proudest of the whole world, <span class="cite-ref">(219)</span> when all others were perishing for want of food. From this it appears, that what is accounted to be slowness in God, tends to no other end than to accomplish his work on the best possible occasion. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(219)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En un peuple le plus superbe de tout le monde</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
