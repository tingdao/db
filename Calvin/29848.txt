<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21</strong><em>If any man shall cleanse himself from these </em>If the reprobate are “vessels for dishonor,” they have that dishonor confined to themselves, but they do not disfigure the house, or bring any disgrace on the head of the family, who, while he has a variety of articles of furniture, appropriates each vessel to its proper use. But let us learn, by their example, to apply them to better and worthier uses; for in the reprobate, as in mirrors, we perceive how detestable is the condition of man, if he do not sincerely promote the glory of God. Such examples, therefore, afford to us good ground for exhortation to devote ourselves to a holy and blameless life. </p><p>There are many who misapply this passage, for the sake of proving that what Paul elsewhere (<span class="bvs">Rom_9:16</span>) declares to belong “to God that sheweth mercy,” is actually within the power of “him that willeth and him that runneth.” This is exceedingly frivolous; for Paul does not here argue about the election of men, in order to shew what is the cause of it, as he does in the ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans (<span class="bvs">Rom_9:0</span>); but only means that we are unlike wicked men, whom we perceive to have been born to their perdition. It is consequently foolish to draw an inference from these words, about the question whether it is in a man’s power to place himself in the number of the children of God, and to be the author of his own adoption. That is not the present question. Let this short warning suffice against those who bid a man cause himself to be predestinated; as if Paul enjoined men to do what they must have done before they were born, and even before the foundations of the world were laid. </p><p>Others, who infer from these words that free-will is sufficient for preparing a man, that he may be fit and qualified for obeying God, do not at first sight appear to be so absurd as the former, yet there is no solidity in what they advance. The Apostle enjoins that men who desire to consecrate themselves to the Lord cleanse themselves from the pollution of wicked men; and throughout the Scriptures God gives the same injunction; for we find nothing here but what we have seen in many passages of Paul’s writings, and especially in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, </p><p>“Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.” <span class="cite-ref">(178)</span></p><p>Beyond all controversy, we are called to holiness. But the question about the calling and duty of Christians is totally different from the question about their power or ability. We do not deny that it is demanded from believers that they purify themselves; but elsewhere the Lord declares that this is their duty, while he promises by Ezekiel that he will send </p><p>“clean waters, that we may be cleansed.” (<span class="bvs">Eze_36:25</span>.) </p><p>Wherefore we ought to supplicate the Lord to cleanse us, instead of vainly trying our strength in this matter without his assistance. </p><p><em>A vessel sanctified for honor </em>means, set apart for honorable and magnificent purposes. In like manner, what is <em>useful </em>to the head of the family is put for that which is applied to agreeable purposes. He afterwards explains the metaphor, when he adds, that we must <em>be prepared for every good work. </em>Away with the wild language of fanatics, “I will contribute to the glory of God, as Pharaoh did; for is it not all one, provided that God be glorified?” For here God explicitly states in what manner he wishes us to serve him, that is, by a religious and holy life. </p><p><strong>(178)</strong> This quotation is taken from <span class="bvs">Isa_52:11</span>, but the passage to which our author, quoting from memory, makes reference, is <span class="bvs">2Co_6:17</span>, where the words of Isaiah have undergone considerable variation See Calvin's Com. On Corinthians, vol. 2, p. 261. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
