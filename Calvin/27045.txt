They consider <span class="cite-ref">(219)</span> with themselves what dangers hang over their heads, to the end they may be the more ready to enter <span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> the same, although they see their enemies press sore upon them; yet lest it should grieve them <span class="cite-ref">(221)</span> to have a new combat ever now and then, they assure <span class="cite-ref">(222)</span> themselves that they shall be invincible <span class="cite-ref">(223)</span> through the same power of God whereby they got the victory before. And it is to be thought (although Luke makes no mention thereof) that the apostles being contented with their former answer, did not contend with those furies, [furious men;] and yet we must persuade ourselves that they were not so forgetful of their former constancy that they did submit themselves unto their ungodly decree like slaves. <span class="cite-ref">(224)</span></p><p><strong>(219)</strong> “Reputent,” let them consider. </p><p><strong>(220)</strong> “Obcundis,” to obviate or face them. </p><p><strong>(221)</strong> “Ne pigeat,” let it not grieve them. </p><p><strong>(222)</strong> “Confidant,” let them confide. </p><p><strong>(223)</strong> “Semper inexpugnabiles,” always invincible. </p><p><strong>(224)</strong> “Ut serviliter excipient,” as servilely to submit. </p></div>
