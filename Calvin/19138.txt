<div class="comment-content"><p><em>The children, </em>he says, <em>gather wood </em>He ascribes the collecting of wood to the young; for it was a more laborious work. As then that age excels in strength, they collected wood; and <em>the fathers kindled the fire: </em>the women, what did they do? They were busy with the meal. Thus no part was neglected. “What then is to be done? and what else can I do, but wholly to cut off a people so wicked?” Then he says, <em>that they may make </em><span class="lang he-il">כונים</span>, <em>cunim, </em>which is translated “cakes, “and this is the most common rendering. Some think that kindling is meant, deriving the word from <span class="lang he-il">כוה</span>, <em>cue, </em>which means to kindle. But I prefer the opinion of those who derive the word from <span class="lang he-il">כון</span>, <em>cun</em>, which is to prepare, as cakes are things prepared. I do not then doubt, but that cakes are meant here, as it appears also from other places. The second interpretation I regard as too refined. <span class="cite-ref">(201)</span></p><p>With regard to the word <span class="lang he-il">למלכת</span>, <em>lamelcath, </em>many consider the letter <span class="lang he-il">א</span> left out, and think that “works” are intended. In this case <span class="lang he-il">מ</span> would be a servile: but others consider it a radical, and render the word, “Queen;” which appears to me probable; though I do not wholly reject what some hold that the workmanship of the heavens is here meant. Some understand the stars, others the sun, and others the moon: let every one enjoy his own opinion. However, I think, that if the workmanship of the heavens be meant, the whole celestial host is to be included, as the Scripture thus calls all the stars. But if “the Queen of the heavens” be adopted, then I am inclined to think that the moon is intended: and we know how much superstition has ever prevailed among most people as to the worship of the moon. Hence I approve of this meaning. Yet I readily admit that all the stars, not one only, may be here designated, and called the work or the workmanship of the heavens. And the Jews, we know, were very much given to this madness: for as the sun was considered by the Orientals as the supreme God, when the Jews became enamoured with this error, they also thought that some high and adorable divinity belonged to the sun: they turned also afterwards to the stars; and this absurdity is often referred to in the Law and also in the Prophets. <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span></p><p>It is then added, <em>That they may pour forth libations to foreign gods, to provoke me to wrath </em>When God complains of being provoked, it is the same as though he had said, that the Jews now openly carried on war with him, — “They sin not through ignorance, nor is it unknown to them how much they offend me by these profanations; but it is as it were their object and design to provoke me and to carry on war with me by these acts of impiety.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(201)</span> The ancient versions (the <em>Arabic </em>excepted) and the <em>Targum </em>render the word, cakes — <em>placentas </em> It is only found elsewhere in <span class="bvs">Jer_44:19</span>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(202)</span> The <em>Septuagint </em>render the words here, “the host of heaven,“ and in <span class="bvs">Jer_44:17</span> and 19, “the queen of heaven.” The <em>Vulgate </em>in the three places, renders them “the queen of heaven,“— the <em>Targum, “ </em>the star of heaven,“ — and the <em>Syriac</em>, “the army of heaven,“ in the two first places, but in the last, “the queen of heaven.” There are several MSS., in the three places, which insert the <span class="lang he-il">א</span>, so as to make the word “work,“ or workmanship: but this change has evidently arisen from the <em>Septuagint. </em>But this word is never used to designate the work of the visible heavens: the word used in that case is <span class="lang he-il">מעשה</span>. See <span class="bvs">Psa_8:3</span>. Our version and the <em>Vulgate </em>are no doubt right. But what is intended by the queen of heaven is not the moon; for the word commonly used for the moon is always masculine, and the word generally used for the sun is commonly feminine. This may appear strange; but so it is. In South Wales the word for sun is always feminine, but in North Wales, masculine. </p><p>In <span class="bvs">Deu_4:19</span>, the sun, the moon, and the stars, as constituting the host of heaven, are mentioned together: these the first, as including all the rest, seems to be intended. Instead of “queen,“ we should say in our language, “the king of the heavens.” We do not read that the Jews worshipped the moon; but the worship of the sun among them is specifically referred to and mentioned. See <span class="bvs">2Kg_23:11</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_8:16</span>. The Israelites adored the sun under the name of Baal, which was the Chemosh of the Moabites, and the Moloch of the Ammonites. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
