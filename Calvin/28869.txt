<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>The mortification of Jesus </em><span class="cite-ref">(470)</span> He says more than he had done previously, for he shows, that the very thing that the false apostles used as a pretext for despising the gospel, was so far from bringing any degree of contempt upon the gospel, that it tended even to render it glorious. For he employs the expression — <em>the mortification of Jesus Christ </em>— to denote everything that rendered him contemptible in the eyes of the world, with the view of preparing him for participating in a blessed resurrection. In the first place, the sufferings of Christ, <span class="cite-ref">(471)</span> however ignominious they may be in the eyes of men, have, nevertheless, more of honor in the sight of God, than all the triumphs of emperors, and all the pomp of kings. The end, however, must also be kept in view, that we <em>suffer with him, </em>that we may be <em>glorified together with him. </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_8:17</span>.) Hence he elegantly reproves the madness of those, who made his peculiar fellowship with Christ a matter of reproach. At the same time, the Corinthians are admonished to take heed, lest they should, while haughtily despising Paul’s mean and abject appearance, do an injury to Christ himself, by seeking an occasion of reproach <span class="cite-ref">(472)</span> in his sufferings, which it becomes us to hold in the highest honor. </p><p>The word rendered <em>mortification, </em><span class="cite-ref">(473)</span> is taken here in a different sense from what it bears in many passages of Scripture. For it often means self-denial, when we renounce the lusts of the flesh, and are renewed unto obedience to God. Here, however, it means the afflictions by which we are stirred up to meditate on the termination of the present life. To make the matter more plain, let us call the former the <em>inward </em>mortification, and the latter the <em>outward. </em>Both make us conformed to Christ, the one directly, the other indirectly, so to speak. Paul speaks of the former in <span class="bvs">Col_3:5</span>, and in <span class="bvs">Rom_6:6</span>, where he teaches that </p><p>our old man is crucified, that we may walk in newness of life </p><p>He treats of the second in <span class="bvs">Rom_8:29</span>, where he teaches, that we were <em>predestinated </em>by God to this end — that we might be<em>conformed to the image of his Son. </em>It is called, however, a <em>mortification </em>of Christ only in the case of believers, because the wicked, in the endurance of the afflictions of this present life, share with Adam, but the elect have participation with the Son of God, so that all those miseries that are in their own nature accursed, are helpful to their salvation. All the sons of God, it is true, have this in common, that they <em>bear about the mortification, of Christ; </em><span class="cite-ref">(474)</span> but, according as any one is distinguished by a larger measure of gifts, he, in that proportion, comes so much the nearer to conformity with Christ in this respect. </p><p><em>That the life of Jesus. </em>Here is the best antidote to adversity — that as Christ’s death is the gate of life, so we know that a blessed resurrection will be to us the termination of all miseries, <span class="cite-ref">(475)</span> inasmuch as Christ has associated us with himself on this condition, that we shall be partakers of his life, if in this world we submit to die with him. </p><p>The sentence that immediately follows may be explained in two ways. If you understand the expression <em>delivered unto death </em>as meaning to be incessantly harassed with persecutions and exposed to dangers, this would be more particularly applicable to Paul, and those like him, who were openly assailed by the fury of the wicked. And thus the expression, for Jesus’ sake, will be equivalent to <em>for the testimony of Christ. </em>(<span class="bvs">Rev_1:9</span>.) As, however, the expression <em>to be daily delivered unto death, </em>means otherwise — to have death constantly before our eyes, and to live in such a manner, that our life is rather a shadow of death, <span class="cite-ref">(476)</span> I have no objection, that this passage, also, should be expounded in such a way as to be applicable to all believers, and that, too, to every one in his order. Paul himself, in <span class="bvs">Rom_8:36</span>, explains in this manner <span class="bvs">Psa_44:22</span>. In this way <em>for Christ’s sake </em>would mean — because this condition is imposed upon all his members. Erasmus, however, has rendered it, with not. so much propriety, <em>we who live. </em>The rendering that I have given is more suitable — <em>while we live. </em>For Paul means that, so long as we are in the world, we resemble the dead rather than the living. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(470)</span> “<em>Mortificationem </em>.” — Such is Calvin’s rendering of the original term <span class="lang el-gr">νέκρωσιν</span>, and it is evidently employed to convey the idea of <em>putting to death</em>, the main idea intended to be expressed being, as our author shows, that the apostles were, for the sake of Christ, subjected to humiliating and painful sufferings, which gave them, in a manner, an outward conformity to their Divine Master in the <em>violent death </em>inflicted upon him. The term mortification, when taken in strict accordance with its etymology, in the sense of putting to death, appears to bring out more fully the apostle’s meaning, than the word “dying,” made use of in our authorized version. Beza, who gives the same rendering as Calvin, subjoins the following valuable observations: — “<em>Mortificationem </em><span class="lang el-gr">τὴν νέκρωσιν</span> — Sic vocat Paulus miseram illam conditionem fidelium, ac pr’sertim ministrorum (de his enim proprie agitur) qui <em>quotidie </em>(ut ait David) <em>occiduntur</em>, quasi <em>destinationem ad coedem </em>dicas: additurque <em>Domini Iesu</em>, vel, (ut legit vetus interpres) <em>Iesu Christi</em>, tum ut declaretur causa propter quam mundus illos ita persequitur; tum etiam quia hac quoque in parte Christo capiti sunt conformes, Christusque adeo ipse quodammodo in iis morte afficitur. Ambrosius maluit <em>mortem </em>interpretari, nempe quia in altero membro sit mentio <em>vitoe </em>Christi. At ego, si libuisset a Pauli verbis discedere, <em>coedem </em>potius exposuissem: quia non temere Paulus <span class="lang el-gr">ςέκρωσιν</span> maluit scribere quam <span class="lang el-gr">θάνατον</span>, quoniam etiam Christus hic considerandus nobis est non ut simpliciter mortuus, sed ut interemptus. Verum ut modo dixi <span class="lang el-gr">νέκρωσις</span> nec <em>mortem </em>nec <em>coedem </em>hic significat, sed conditionem illam <em>quotidianis mortibus </em>obnoxiam, qualis etiam fuit Christi ad tempus;” — “<em>Mortification </em><span class="lang el-gr">τὴν νέκρωσιν</span> This term Paul makes use of to denote that miserable condition of believers, and more especially of ministers, (for it is of them properly that he speaks,) who are, as David says, <em>killed every day </em>— as though you should say a <em>setting apart for slaughter</em>; and it is added — <em>of the Lord Jesus</em>, or (as the old interpreter renders it) <em>of Jesus Christ</em>, partly with the view of explaining the reason why the world thus persecutes them, and partly because in this respect also they are conformed to Christ, the Head, and even Christ himself is, in them, in a manner put to death. Ambrose has preferred to render it <em>death</em>, for this reason, that in the other clause mention is made of the <em>life </em>of Christ. For my own part, however, were I to depart from Paul’s words, I would rather render it <em>slaughter</em>, inasmuch as Paul did not rashly make use of <span class="lang el-gr">νέκρωσιν</span> rather than <span class="lang el-gr">θάνατον</span>, since Christ also is to be viewed by us here, not simply as having died, but as <em>having been put to death</em>. But, as I said a little ago, <span class="lang el-gr">νέκρωσις</span> here does not mean <em>death </em>nor <em>slaughter</em>, but a condition which exposed <em>every day to deaths</em>, such as Christ’s, also, was for a time.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(471)</span> By the “sufferings of Christ,” here, Calvin obviously means — not the sufferings of our Redeemer <em>personally</em>, <em>but sufferings endured for Christ in the persons of his members</em>, as in <span class="bvs">Col_1:24</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(472)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Matiere d’opprobre et deshonneur</span>;” — “Matter of reproach and dishonor.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(473)</span> Wiclif (1380) renders the expression as follows: “euermore we beren aboute the sleyng of Ihesus in oure bodi.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(474)</span> “Here we have a strong mode of expressing the mortal peril to which he was continually exposed; (as in <span class="bvs">1Co_15:31</span>, <span class="lang el-gr">καθ ᾿ ἡμέραν ἀποθνήσκω</span>, <em>I die daily</em>,) together with an indirect comparison of the sufferings endured by himself and the other apostles, with those endured by the Lord Jesus even <em>unto death</em>. The genitive <span class="lang el-gr">τοῦ Κυριου</span> (<em>of the Lord</em>,) is, as Grotius remarks, a genitive of <em>likeness</em>. The sense is — <em>‘bearing about </em>— continually sustaining, perils and sufferings, like those of the Lord Jesus.’” — <em>Bloomfield</em>, — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(475)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La fin et l’issue de toutes miseres et calamitez</span>;” — “The end and issue of all miseries and calamities.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(476)</span> Calvin manifestly alludes to the expression which occurs in <span class="bvs">Psa_23:4</span>, <em>the valley of the shadow of death</em>, which he explains in a metaphorical sense, as denoting deep afflication. — See Calvin on the Psalms, vol. 1, pp. 394-396. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
