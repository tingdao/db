<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And if thou shalt say to me. </em>Rabshakeh employs an argument which consists of three parts. Either Hezekiah thinks that he has sufficient strength to resist, or he expects assistance from Egypt, or he trusts in God. If he trusts in himself, he is mistaken; for what is he when compared to my king? As to Egypt, it will render him no assistance, but on the contrary will inflict serious damage. It remains therefore that he expects some assistance from God. But he has thrown down his altars and curtailed his worship; will he not rather be punished on that account? In short, this Rabshakeh takes away from the pious king all assistance, both divine and human. </p><p>By this slander Satan attempted not only to wound the heart of the king, that it might sink under the weight, of affliction, but to make an impression on the light and fickle multitude; because hitherto in the hearts of many there remained an attachment to superstition, and there was a strong tendency to fall back into this imposture, because the religion which was ancient, and to which they were long accustomed, had been changed, and, in their opinion, <span class="cite-ref">(31)</span> Hezekiah was about to be chastised for his own rashness. In like manner, the Papists in the present day, whenever any adverse event befalls us, maintain that we are punished by God, because we have ventured to set aside ancient ceremonies. <span class="cite-ref">(32)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(31)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A leur advis</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(32)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource que nous avons ose abolir les traditions et ceremonies qui estoyent en usage de long temps</span>.” “Because we ventured to abolish the traditions and ceremonies which had been long used.” </p></div></div>
