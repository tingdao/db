<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet now anticipates an objection, lest the Jews should expostulate with God; for it sufficiently appears that they always complained of God’s extreme severity, when they indulged themselves in their vices. As soon then as God treated them as they deserved, they became exasperated and enraged against him. Hence the Prophet now meets their perverse and unjust complaints, and asks, why they <em>cried out for their bruising, </em>as though he had said, that these clamors were much too late, when they had passed by the season for repentance. For God had suspended his extreme threatenings until the people had betrayed so much obstinacy, that there was no room for mercy. When, therefore, the people’s wickedness had become unhealable, the Prophet, as we have seen, proclaimed their exile. </p><p>Now, indeed, he derides their late crying, for they had been too long torpid in their contempt of God: <em>Why, </em>then, <em>dost thou cry for thy bruising? grievous is thy sorrow, </em>or, grievousness is to thy sorrow; <span class="cite-ref">(12)</span> but <em>for the multitude of thine iniquity, and because thy sins have grown strong, have I done these things to thee </em>Here God frees himself from the calumnies of the people, and shews that those who murmured or made a clamor, acted unjustly, having not considered what they merited: for they were worthy of the heaviest punishment, because they not only in one way brought ruin on themselves, and more and more kindled God’s vengeance, but had also for many years hardened themselves in their sins; and they had, besides, given themselves up, in various ways, to every kind of wickedness, so that the Prophet justly upbraided them with a <em>multitude of iniquity, </em>and also with a mass of <em>sins. </em>God then says, that he had not exceeded the limits of moderation in the punishment he inflicted on the people, because their desperate wickedness and perverseness compelled him. But consolation is immediately subjoined, — </p><p><strong>(12)</strong> Rather “sore,” or wound. The word <span class="lang he-il">מכאב</span> indeed means sometimes the soreness or wound of the mind, that is, sorrow or grief; but here, no doubt, it retains its primary idea, correspondently with stroke, bruise, and wound. The <em>Targ. </em>retains this meaning, while the versions go all astray. Then it is, “Miserable is thy sore.” The rest of the verse is as follows, — </p><p>Because multiplied had thine iniquity, <LineBreak />Grown strong had thy sins, <LineBreak />Have I done these things to thee. </p><p>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
