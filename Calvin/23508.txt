<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>Lo, my servant, whom I have chosen. </em>To fix our attention more closely on his will, God points out by the finger, as it were, the person whom he is about to send; and this is the design of the exclamation, Lo! A similar reason may be assigned for the epithets that follow, when God calls him <em>his servant, his elect in whom his soul is well pleased. </em>For whence comes it, that men venture to measure Christ by their own sense, but because they do not consider that their redemption depends exclusively on the grace of God? When God offers to us an invaluable treasure, it is excessive and wicked presumption to regulate our estimation of it by the disdainful views of our flesh. He is called a <em>servant, </em>not as if he were of the ordinary rank, but by way of eminence, and as the person to whom God has committed the charge and office of redeeming his Church. As: </p><p>no man taketh this honor to himself, but he who is called of God <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Heb_5:6</span>) </p><p>is justly entitled to this rank, God declares that he who comes forward in this character was <em>elected </em>by his decree. <span class="cite-ref">(96)</span> Hence it follows, that men are not at liberty to reject him; because, by doing so, they would be guilty of contempt and rebellion against God. And, indeed, it were the height of absurdity that our choice or our pride should set aside that calling of God which ought to be regarded as sacred and inviolable. </p><p><em>My beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. </em>There is a still wider import in this statement, which God next makes by the prophet, that the delight of his soul dwells in Christ; for though the calling of each of us proceeds from the free favor of God as its only source, yet in Christ there is this remarkable peculiarity, that in his person God the Father embraces in his love the whole Church. As we are all by nature enemies of God, his love will never come to us till it first begin with the Head; which we have seen on a former occasion, and will see again under another passage, (<span class="bvs">Mat_17:5</span>.) </p><p><em>He will proclaim judgment to the Gentiles. </em>The prophet gives a brief description of Christ’s office, when he foretells that <em>he will proclaim judgment to the Gentiles </em>By the word <em>judgment </em>the Jews understand a government which is correctly and properly arranged, in which order and justice prevail. The design of the prophet is to inform us, that a person will come who will restore justice that had fallen, who will be the governor not of one nation only, but will also bring under subjection to God the Gentiles, among whom dreadful confusion formerly prevailed. And this is the import of the word <em>bring forth, </em>which the prophet employs; for it was the office of Christ to spread throughout the whole world the kingdom of God, which was at that time confined to the corner of Judea; <span class="cite-ref">(97)</span> as it is said in another passage, </p><p>The Lord will send forth the scepter of thy power out of Zion, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_110:2</span>.) </p><p><em>I will put my Spirit upon him. </em>This explains the manner in which judgment shall be <em>brought forth. </em>It is no doubt true, that there never was any portion whatever of <em>righteousness </em>in the world that did not proceed from the Spirit of God, and that was not maintained by his heavenly power; as none of the kings of the earth can frame or defend good order, except so far as he shall be assisted by the same Spirit. But in <em>bringing forth judgment </em>Christ is greatly superior to all others, for he has received the Spirit from the Father, that he may pour it out on all his people; for not only does he by word or writing prescribe what is proper, but inwardly forms the hearts of men, by the grace of his Spirit, to preserve the rule of righteousness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(96)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Dieu prononce que par son ordonnance il a eleu celuy qu’on verra venir ayant les marques qu’il met la</span>;” — “God declares that, by his decree, he hath elected him who will be seen coming, attended by the marks which he there describes.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(97)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui estoit pour lors comme enclos en un anglet au pays de Iudee</span>;” —”which was then shut up, as it were in a corner, in the country of Judea.” </p></div></div>
