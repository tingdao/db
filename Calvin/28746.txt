<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>That God may be all in all </em>Will it be so in the Devil and wicked men also? By no means — unless perhaps we choose to take the verb to be as meaning, <em>to be known, and openly beheld. </em>In that case the meaning will be: <em>“For </em>the present, as the Devil resists God, as wicked men confound and disturb the order which he has established, and as endless occasions of offense present themselves to our view, it does not distinctly appear that <em>God is all in all; </em>but when Christ will have executed the judgment which has been committed to him by the Father, and will have cast down Satan and all the wicked, the glory of God will be conspicuous in their destruction. The same thing may be said also respecting powers that are sacred and lawful in their kind, for they in a manner hinder God’s being seen aright by us in himself. Then, on the other hand, God, holding the government of the heaven and the earth by himself, and without any medium, will in that respect be <em>all, </em>and will consequently at last be so, not only in all persons, but also in all creatures.” </p><p>This is a pious interpretation, <span class="cite-ref">(62)</span> and, as it corresponds sufficiently well with the Apostle’s design, I willingly embrace it. There would, however, be nothing out of place in understanding it as referring exclusively to believers, in whom God has now begun his kingdom, and will then perfect it, and in such a way that they shall cleave to him wholly. Both meanings sufficiently refute of themselves the wicked frenzies of some who bring forward this passage in proof of them. Some imagine, that God will be <em>all in all </em>in this respect, that all things will vanish and dissolve into nothing. Paul’s words, however, mean nothing but this, that all things will be brought back to God, as their alone beginning and end, that they may be closely bound to him. Others infer from this that the Devil and all the wicked will be saved — as if God would not altogether be better known in the Devil’s destruction, than if he were to associate the Devil with himself, and make him one with himself. We see then, how impudently madmen of this sort wrest this statement of Paul for maintaining their blasphemies. </p><p><strong>(62)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce sens contient doctrine saincte</span>;” — “This view contains sacred doctrine.” </p></div>
