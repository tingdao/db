<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>After these things came Jesus. </em>It is probable that Christ, when the feast was past, came into that part of Judea which was in the vicinity of the town <em>Enon</em>, which was situated in the tribe of Manasseh. The Evangelist says that <em>there were many waters there</em>, and these were not so abundant in Judea. Now geographers tell us, that these two towns, <em>Enon </em>and <em>Salim</em>, were not far from the confluence of the river Jordan and the brook Jabbok; and they add that Scythopolis was near them. From these words, we may infer that John and Christ administered baptism by plunging the whole body beneath the water; though we ought not to give ourselves any great uneasiness about the outward rite, provided that it agree with the spiritual truth, and with the Lordâ€™s appointment and rule. So far as we are able to conjecture, the; vicinity of those places caused various reports to be circulated, and many discussions to arise, about the Law, about the worship of God, and about the condition of the Church, in consequence of two persons who administered baptism having arisen at the same time. For when the Evangelist says that <em>Christ baptized</em>, I refer this to the commencement of his ministry; namely, that he then began to exercise publicly the office which was appointed to him by the Father. And though Christ did this by his disciples, yet he is here named as the Author of the baptism, without mentioning his ministers, who did nothing but in his name and by his command. On this subject, we shall have something more to say in the beginning of the next Chapter. </p></div>
