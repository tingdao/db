<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>On account of my love they have been opposed to me </em><span class="cite-ref">(296)</span> The Psalmist had already solemnly declared, that his adversaries, unprovoked by any injury inflicted upon them by him, and without any just cause, became, through mere diabolical rage, his most implacable foes. Here he confirms the truth of that declaration by saying, that he had been their friend. For there is far more merit in showing kindness to an enemy than simply abstaining from doing that which is evil. And from this we may perceive, that the influence of Satan must be awfully powerful when he takes the hearts of men captive at his will. For nothing can be more unnatural than to hate and cruelly persecute those who love us. To <em>love </em>he also adds deeds of kindness, meaning, that it was his aim to secure their good will by outward acts of beneficence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(296)</span> “This expression,” says Hengstenberg, “finds its full truth in Christ. Christ’s love to man was daily manifested by his miraculous healing all the infirmities of the body, which was returned by man’s hatred of Him, as displayed in his general conduct.” </p></div></div>
