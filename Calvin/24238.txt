<div class="comment-content"><p>This demoniac was probably one of that multitude, which was mentioned, a little before, by <span class="bvs">Mat_4:24</span>. Yet the narrative of Mark and Luke is not superfluous: for they relate some circumstances, which not only present the miracle in a more striking light, but also contain useful instruction. The devil dexterously acknowledges, that Christ is <em>the Holy One of God, </em>in order to insinuate into the minds of men a suspicion, that there was some secret understanding between him and Christ. By such a trick he has since endeavored to make the Gospel suspected, and, in the present day, he is continually making similar attempts. That is the reason why Christ rebukes him. It is, no doubt, possible, that this confession was violently extorted from him: but there is no inconsistency between the two suppositions, that he is forced to yield to the power of Christ, and therefore <em>cries out </em>that he is <em>the Holy One of God, </em>— and yet that he cunningly attempts to shroud in his own darkness the glory of Christ. At the same time, we must observe that, while he flatters Christ in this manner, he indirectly withdraws himself from his power, and in this way contradicts himself. For why was Christ sanctified by the Father, but that he might deliver men from the tyranny of the devil, and overturn his kingdom? But as Satan cannot endure that power, which he feels to be destructive to himself, he would desire that Christ should satisfy himself with an empty title, without exercising it on the present occasion. <span class="cite-ref">(344)</span></p><p><span class="bvs">Mar_1:22</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_4:32</span><strong>.</strong><em>And they were astonished at his doctrine </em>The meaning of the Evangelists is, that the power of the Spirit shone in the preaching <span class="cite-ref">(345)</span> of Christ with such brightness, as to extort admiration even from irreligious and cold hearers. Luke says, that <em>his discourse was accompanied with power, </em>that is, full of majesty. Mark expresses it more fully, by adding a contrast, that it was unlike the manner of teaching of <em>the Scribes </em>As they were false expounders of Scripture, their doctrine was literal and dead, breathed nothing of the power of the Spirit, and was utterly destitute of majesty. The same kind of coldness may be now observed in the speculative theology of Popery. Those masters do indeed thunder out whatever they think proper in a sufficiently magisterial style; but as their manner of discoursing about divine things is so profane, that their controversies exhibit no traces of religion, what they bring forward is all affectation and mere drivelling: for the declaration of the Apostle Paul holds true, that <em>the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_4:20</span>.) In short, the Evangelists mean that, while the manner of teaching, which then prevailed, was so greatly degenerated and so extremely corrupted, that it did not impress the minds of men with any reverence for God, the preaching of Christ was eminently distinguished by the divine power of the Spirit, which procured for him the respect of his hearers. This is the <em>power, </em>or rather the majesty and <em>authority, </em>at which the people were astonished. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(344)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais pource que Satan ne pent endurer ceste vertue et puissance, aquelle il sait estre le destruire et ruiner, il voudroit bien que Christ se contenant d'un beau titre en l'air, se reposast, et se deportast de luy rien faire</span>.” — “But because Satan cannot endure that power and might, which he knows to be to destroy and ruin him, he would rather wish that Christ, satisfying himself with a fine title in the air, should take repose, and refrain from doing any thing to him. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(345)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En la facon d’enseigner de Jesus Christ</span>;” — “in Jesus Christ's manner of teaching.” </p></div></div>
