<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>Of your ownselves shall arise. </em>This amplifieth the grievousness of the evil, because there be some wolves within, and so hiding themselves under the title of pastors, [which] do wait for some opportunity wherein they may do hurt. Also, he declareth what danger these wolves do threaten, to wit, the scattering abroad of the flock, when the Church is drawn away from the unity of faith, and is divided into sects. Neither are all those wolves who do not their duty as they ought, but there be oftentimes hirelings, a kind of men not so hurtful as the other. But the corruption of doctrine is a most deadly plague to the sheep. Now, in the third place, the fountain and beginning of this evil is noted, because they will draw disciples after them. Therefore, ambition is the mother of all heresies. For the sincerity of the word of God doth then flourish when the pastors join hand in hand to bring disciples unto Christ, because this alone is the sound state of the Church, that he be heard alone;<span class="cite-ref">(437)</span> wherefore, both the doctrine of salvation must needs be perverted, and also the safety of the flock must needs go to nought, where men be desirous of mastership. And as this place teacheth that almost all corruptions of doctrine flow from the pride of men, so we learn again out of the same that it cannot otherwise be, but that ambitious men will turn away from right purity, and corrupt the word of God. For seeing that the pure and sincere handling of the Scripture tendeth to this end, that Christ alone may have the preeminence, and that men can challenge nothing to themselves, but they shall take so much from the glory of Christ, it followeth that those are corrupters of sound doctrine who are addicted to themselves, and study to advance their own glory, which doth only darken Christ. Which thing the Lord doth confirm in the seventh of John ( <span class="bvs">Joh_7:18</span>). Furthermore, by the word <em>arise </em>which he useth, he signifieth that those wolves do nourish secret destruction until they may have some opportunity offered to break out.</p><p>And this place doth very well prevent an horrible stumbling-block and offense which Satan hath always cast in to trouble weak consciences. If external and professed enemies do resist the gospel, this doth not so much hurt to the Church,<span class="cite-ref">(438)</span> as if inward enemies issue out of the bosom of the Church, which at a sudden blow to the field,<span class="cite-ref">(439)</span> or which unfaithfully provoke the people to fall away; and yet God hath from the beginning exercised his Church with this temptation, and now doth exercise it. Wherefore, let our faith be fortified with this defense that it fail not, if at any time it so fall out that pastors begin to rage like wolves. He saith they shall be “grievous wolves”, that he may the more terrify them; secondly, they shall be authors of wicked opinions, and that to the end they may draw disciples after them, because it cannot almost otherwise be but that ambition will corrupt the purity of the gospel.</p><p>By this it appeareth also how frivolous and vain the brag of the Papists is touching their continual succession. For seeing we can easily show that these horned beasts are nothing less than that which they will be thought to be, being always convicted, they fly unto this fortress, that they succeed the apostles by a continual course.<span class="cite-ref">(440)</span> As if these did not also succeed them, of whom Paul willeth to take heed.<span class="cite-ref">(441)</span> Therefore, seeing that God, either to prove the constancy of his [people], or in his just judgment doth oftentimes suffer wolves to rage under the person of pastors, the authority doth not consist in the name and place alone, neither is succession anything worth unless faith and integrity be joined therewithal. But and if the Papists object that they cannot be called wolves, one word of Paul shall be as a touchstone to prove whether this be so or no, that they may (saith he) draw disciples after them. And to what end tendeth all Popish religion, save only that men’s lust and pleasure may reign instead of God’s word? But Christ hath no disciples where he is not counted the only master.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(437)</span></p><p>“ Unus Magister,” as the only Master. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(438)</span></p><p>“ Minus hoc consternat pias mentes,” this does less alarm pious minds. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(439)</span></p><p>“ Classicum caught,” blow the trumpet. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(440)</span></p><p>“ Continua serie,” in an unbroken series. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(441)</span></p><p>“ Cavendum... admonet,” admonishes us to beware. </p></div></div>
