<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah treats his own people here with more severity, for he saw that they were refractory, and so obstinate in their vices, that they could not by wise counsels be restored to the way of safety. Hence he addresses them here as men wholly irreclaimable, and to whom instruction proved useless. But though according to the manner of the prophets, he sounds a trumpet for the sake of filling them with terror, he seems yet to speak tauntingly, when he bids them to <em>proclaim in Judah, </em>and <em>to publish in Jerusalem; </em>as though he had said, When distress shall seize you, you will then by experience perceive that God is angry with you: though to — day ye believe not my warnings; yet that God may not, indeed, by a violent hand, bring you back to himself, and as ye seek evasions for yourselves, ye shall sound the trumpet, and proclaim, “The enemies are coming, and are nigh at hand; let, therefore, every one flee to Jerusalem, and enter into the city, and resort unto Zion: “that is, “If we cannot secure our safety in the city, we shall at least be safe in the fortress of Sion.” But God, he says, <em>brings an evil on you from the north; </em>and whatever ye may think will be for your safety will be wholly useless. It is, however, proper, especially to regard the Prophet as God’s herald proclaiming war; and that though he exults over their perverseness, he yet declares that such would be everywhere the terror, that they would seek safety by flight. </p><p><em>Sound, </em>he says, <em>in Judah, and publish, </em>or <em>proclaim</em>, <em>in Jerusalem, </em>(<span class="lang he-il">הגידו</span>, <em>egidu, </em>announce, literally.) He speaks not here for the same purpose as Joel did, (<span class="bvs">Joe_1:1</span>,) when he bade them to sound the trumpet; for the latter exhorted the people to repent; but Jeremiah, as I have already said, tauntingly reproves here the people for their obstinacy and perverseness; as though he had said, “I see what ye will do, when God’s vengeance shall come upon you, that ye may not even then repent; for ye will sound the trumpet through the whole land, ‘Let all resort to Sion;’ as though ye could resist there your enemies, and preserve your lives.” He does not, then, bid them to sound the trumpet, but, on the contrary, shews what they would do. </p><p>Some improperly give this rendering, “Fulfill ye, “but the common version is, “Assemble yourselves.” But interpreters seem not to me to have regarded the etymology of the word; for it is of the same meaning in Hebrew as when we say, <em>Amassez-vous, </em>Gather yourselves. <em>And say, Be ye assembled, and let us go into fortified cities </em>It will, indeed, be announced to you to seek hiding — places to protect you from the assaults of your enemies; if so, <em>Raise a banner in Sion, and flee; </em>but God will at the same time <em>bring evil </em>on you <em>from the north </em></p></div>
