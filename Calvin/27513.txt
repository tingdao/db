The wicked oftentimes when they see wonders, though they tremble for a time, yet are they straightway made more obstinate, as it befell Pharaoh, ( <span class="bvs">Exo_8:8</span>;) at least they are not so tamed that they give over themselves to God.

He demandeth how he may obtain salvation; whereby it appeareth more plainly that he was not suddenly taken with some light<span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> fear of God only, but truly humbled to offer himself to be a scholar to his ministers. He knew that they were cast in prison for no other cause, save only because they did overthrow the common estate of religion. Now he is ready to hear their doctrine which he had before contemned.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(219)</span></p><p>“ Serio,” seriously. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(220)</span></p><p>“ Evanido,” evanescent. </p></div></div>
