<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>incline thine ear unto me. </em>These words express with how much ardor Davidâ€™s soul was stimulated to pray. He affects no splendid or ornate language, as rhetoricians are wont to do; but only describes in suitable figures the vehemence of his desire. In praying that he may be delivered <em>speedily </em>there is shown the greatness of his danger, as if he had said, All will soon be over with my life, unless God make haste to help me. By the words, <em>house of defense, fortress, </em>and <em>rock, </em>he intimates, that, being unable to resist his enemies, his hope rests only on the protection of God. </p></div>
