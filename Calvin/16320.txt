<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Our oxen</em>, <em>etc</em>. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">סבל</span>, <em>sabal</em>, is properly to carry. Accordingly some understand <span class="lang he-il">מסובלים</span>, <em>mesubbalim</em>, to mean robust, <span class="cite-ref">(274)</span> as unless they were strong oxen they would not be fit for carriage, or bearing burdens. Others think they are spoken of as laden with fat. There is no need for insisting upon this point, as it does not affect the main scope of the passage. It may be more important to notice, that God’s fatherly care of his people is celebrated on the account that he condescends to attend to every the smallest matter which concerns their advantage. As in the verse before he had ascribed the fruitfulness of the herds and flocks to God’s goodness, so now the fattening of their oxen, to show that there is nothing relating to us here which he overlooks. As it would signify little to have abundance of everything unless we could enjoy it, he takes notice of it as another part of the Lord’s kindness that the people were peaceable and quiet. By <em>breach </em>I have no doubt that he alludes to hostile incursions, that there was no enemy to break in upon them through demolished gates or walls. By <em>goings out </em>it is surprising that any should understand exile, that the people were not torn away from the bounds of their native country. All he means simply is, in my opinion, that there was no necessity of sallying out to repel an enemy, none offering violence or molestation. To the same effect is the expression, as to any crying in the streets, the effect of a sudden tumult. The meaning is, accordingly, that there was no disturbance in the cities, because God kept enemies at a distance. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(274)</span><span class="lang he-il">מסבלים</span>, <em>burdened</em>, viz. with flesh, according to Pagninus, who has <em>onusti carne</em>. The root is <span class="lang he-il">סכל</span>, and the form is the pual participle, which occurs only in this place. Compensis has paraphrased it: santi et ferendis <em>oneribus apti </em>. Perhaps burdened oxen may be a phrase equivalent to our <em>beasts of burden </em>such as are strong and adapted to carry burdens; and here the prayer of the Psalmist is, that they may be <em>eminently </em>fitted for this service.” — <em>Phillips </em></p></div></div>
