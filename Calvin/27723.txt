<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Lord, they know. </em>By this speech Paul doth testify that he was not beside himself, or brought into perplexity,<span class="cite-ref">(516)</span> but that he did assuredly believe the oracle. For without doubt he knew Christ, whom he calleth Lord. And Paul objecteth, that it cannot almost be, but that when they see him so suddenly changed, such a spectacle will move them. Whence he gathereth that he shall not be unfruitful. He thought so indeed; but Christ answereth flatly, that he hath appointed him another charge, and he taketh from him the hope which he had in vain conceived touching the Jews. The question is, whether it were lawful for Paul to object these reasons to Christ; for it is as much as if he did avouch that that is probable, which Christ said could not be. I answer, that God giveth his saints leave, familiarly, to utter their affections before him;<span class="cite-ref">(517)</span> especially when they seek no other thing but the confirmation of their faith.</p><p>If any man stand in his own conceit, or stubbornly refuse that which God commandeth, his arrogancy shall be worthily condemned; but God vouchsafeth his faithful servants of a singular privilege, that they may modestly object those things which may call them back from the desire to obey; to the end that being free from lets, they may wholly addict themselves to serve God; as Paul, after that he was taught that it pleased the Lord that it should be so, he doth not gainsay nor contend any longer, but being content with that one exception, and making an end there, he maketh himself ready to take his journey, which he seemed to be loath to take. In the mean season, whereas the Jews are not touched with so many miracles, their stubbornness and pride, which cannot be tamed, is discovered. Which upbraiding did undoubtedly cause them to rage.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(516)</span></p><p>“ Mente aliena tam vel perplexum,” alienated or perplexed in mind. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(517)</span></p><p>“Ut familiariter in ejus sinum exonerent suos affeetus ,” to unburden their feelings familiarly into his breast. </p></div></div>
