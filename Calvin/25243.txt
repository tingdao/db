<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>47.</strong><em>Her many sins are forgiven </em>Some interpret the verb differently, <em>may her many sins be forgiven, </em>and bring out the following meaning: — “As this woman evinces by remarkable actions, that she is full of ardent love to Christ, it would be improper for the Church to act harshly and severely towards her; but, on the contrary, she ought to be treated with gentleness, whatever may have been the aggravations of her offenses.” But as <span class="lang el-gr">ἀφέωνται</span> is used, in accordance with the Athic dialect, for <span class="lang el-gr">ἀφεῖνται</span><em>, </em>we must dispense with that subtlety of exposition which is disapproved by the context; for a little after, Christ uses the same words in his address to the woman, where the imperative mood would not apply. Here, too is added a corresponding clause, that <em>he to whom less is forgiven loveth less </em></p><p>The verb, which is in the present tense, must, no doubt, be resolved into a preterite. <span class="cite-ref">(248)</span> From the eager desire which she had manifested to discharge all the duties of piety, Christ infers that, although this woman might have been guilty of many sins, the mercy of God was so abundant towards her, that she ought no longer to be regarded as a sinner. Again, <em>loving </em>is not here said to be the cause of pardon, <span class="cite-ref">(249)</span> but a subsequent manifestation, as I have formerly mentioned; for the meaning of the words is this: — “They who perceive the display of deep piety in the woman form an erroneous judgment, if they do not conclude that God is already reconciled to her;” so that the free pardon of sins comes first in order. Christ does not inquire at what price men may purchase the favor of God, but argues that God has already forgiven this wretched sinner, and that, therefore, a mortal man ought not to treat her with severity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(248)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien qu’il faut resoudre le verbe du temps present en un temps passe: comme quand il dit, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Ses pechez luy sont pardonnez: </em><span class="lang fr-fr">il faut entendre, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Ont este pardonnez </em>;” — “though the verb must be resolved from the present tense into a past tense: as when he says, <em>Her sins are forgiven, </em>we must understand it to mean, <em>Have been forgiven. </em>” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(249)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’est pas dit ici que la dilection ou amour des hommes envers Dieu soit la cause de la remission des pechez</span>;” — “it is not here said that the <em>loving, </em>or the love of men towards God, is the cause of the forgiveness of sins.” </p></div></div>
