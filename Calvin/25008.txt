<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>And Simeon blessed them </em>If you confine this to Joseph and Mary, there will be no difficulty. But, as Luke appears to include Christ at the same time, it might be asked, What right had Simeon to take upon him the office of blessing Christ? “Without all contradiction,” says Paul, “the less is blessed of the greater,” (<span class="bvs">Heb_7:7</span>.) Besides, it has the appearance of absurdity, that any mortal man should offer prayers in behalf of the Son of God. I answer: The Apostle does not speak there of every kind of blessing, but only of the priestly blessing: for, in other respects, it is highly proper in men to pray for each other. Now, it is more probable that <em>Simeon blessed them, </em>as a private man and as one of the people, than that he did so in a public character: for, as we have already said, we nowhere read that he was a priest. But there would be no absurdity in saying, that he prayed for the prosperity and advancement of Christ’s kingdom: for in the book of Psalms the Spirit prescribes such a <span class="lang el-gr">εὐλογία</span><em>, </em>—<em>a blessing </em>of this nature to all the godly. </p><p>“Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; <LineBreak />we have blessed you in the name of the Lords” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_118:26</span>.) </p><p><em>Lo, this has been set </em>This discourse was, no doubt, directly addressed by Simeon to Mary; but it has a general reference to all the godly. The holy virgin needed this admonition, that she might not (as usually happens) be lifted up by prosperous beginnings, so as to be less prepared for enduring afflictive events. But she needed it on another account, that she might not expect Christ to be received by the people with universal applause, but that her mind, on the contrary, might be fortified by unshaken courage against all hostile attacks. It was the design, at the same time, of the Spirit of God, to lay down a general instruction for all the godly. When they see the world opposing Christ with wicked obstinacy, they must be prepared to meet that opposition, and to contend against it undismayed. The unbelief of the world is—we know it—a great and serious hinderance; but it must be conquered, if we wish to believe in Christ. There never was a state of human society so happily constituted, that the greater part followed Christ. Those who will enlist in the cause of Christ must learn this as one of their earliest lessons, and must “put on” this “armor,” (<span class="bvs">Eph_6:11</span>,) that they may be steadfast in believing on him. </p><p>It was by far the heaviest temptation, that Christ was not acknowledged by his own countrymen, and was even ignominiously rejected by that nation, which boasted that it was the Church of God; and, particularly, that the priests and scribes, who held in their hands the government of the Church, were his most determined enemies. For who would have thought, that he was the King of those, who not only rejected him, but treated him with such contempt and outrage? </p><p>We see, then, that a good purpose was served by Simeon’s prediction, that Christ was <em>set for the ruin of many in Israel </em>The meaning is, that he was divinely appointed to cast down and destroy many. But it must be observed, that the ruin of unbelievers results from their striking against him. This is immediately afterwards expressed, when Simeon says that Christ is <em>a sign, which is spoken against </em>Because unbelievers are rebels against Christ, they clash themselves against him, and hence comes their <em>ruin </em>This metaphor is taken from a mark shot at by archers, <span class="cite-ref">(200)</span> as if Simeon had said, Hence we perceive the malice of men, and even the depravity of the whole human race, that all, as if they had made a conspiracy, rise in murmurs and rebellion against the Son of God. The world would not display such harmony in opposing the Gospel, if there were not a natural enmity between the Son of God and those men. The ambition or fury of the enemies of the Gospel carries them in various directions, faction splits them into various sects, and a wide variety of superstitions distinguishes idolaters from each other. But while they thus differ among themselves, they all agree in this, to oppose the Son of God. It has been justly observed, that the opposition everywhere made to Christ is too plain an evidence of human depravity. That the world should thus rise against its Creator is a monstrous sight. But Scripture predicted that this would happen, and the reason is very apparent, that men who have once been alienated from God by sin, always fly from him. Instances of this kind, therefore, ought not to take us by surprise; but, on the contrary, our faith, provided with this armor, ought to be prepared to fight with the contradiction of the world. </p><p>As God has now gathered an Israel to himself from the whole world, and there is no longer a distinction between the Jew and the Greek, the same thing must now happen as, we learn, happened before. Isaiah had said of his own age, </p><p><em>“ </em>The Lord will be for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offense, to both the houses of Israel,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_8:14</span>.) </p><p>From that time, the Jews hardly ever ceased to dash themselves against God, but the rudest shock was against Christ. The same madness is now imitated by those who call themselves Christians; and even those, who lay haughty claims to the first rank in the Church, frequently employ all the power which they possess in oppressing Christ. But let us remember, all that they gain is, to be at length crushed and <em>“ </em>broken in pieces,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_8:9</span>.) </p><p>Under the word <em>ruin </em>the Spirit denounces the punishment of unbelievers, and thus warns us to keep at the greatest possible distance from them; lest, by associating with them, we become involved in the same destruction. And Christ is not the less worthy of esteem, because, when he appears, many are ruined: for the “savor” of the Gospel is not less “sweet” and delightful to God, (<span class="bvs">2Co_2:15</span>,) though it is destructive to the ungodly world. Does any one inquire, how Christ occasions the <em>ruin </em>of unbelievers, who without him were already lost? The reply is easy. Those who voluntarily deprive themselves of the salvation which God has offered to them, perish twice. <em>Ruin </em>implies the double punishment which awaits all unbelievers, after that they have knowingly and wilfully opposed the Son of God. </p><p><em>And for the resurrection </em>This consolation is presented as a contrast with the former clause, to make it less painful to our feelings: for, if nothing else were added, it would be melancholy to hear, that Christ is <em>“ </em>a stone of stumbling,” which will break and crush, by its hardness, a great part of men. Scripture therefore reminds us of his office, which is entirely different: for the salvation of men, which is founded on it, is secure; as Isaiah also says, <em>“ </em>Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread; and he shall be for a sanctuary,” or fortress of defense, (<span class="bvs">Isa_8:13</span>.) And Peter speaks more clearly: </p><p><em>“ </em>To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house. Wherefore also it is contained in Scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion the head-stone of the corner, elect, precious, and he that believeth in him shall not be confounded. Unto you, therefore, which believe, he is precious: but unto them who are disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,” (<span class="bvs">1Pe_2:4</span>; <span class="bvs">Isa_28:16</span>.) </p><p>That we may not be terrified by the designation bestowed on Christ, “a stone of stumbling,” let it be instantly recollected, on the other hand, that he is likewise called the “corner-stone,” on which rests the salvation of all the godly. <span class="cite-ref">(201)</span></p><p>Let it be also taken into account, that the former is accidental, while the latter is properly and strictly his office. Besides, it deserves our notice, that Christ is not only called the support, but the <em>resurrection </em>of the godly: for the condition of men is not one in which it is safe for them to remain. They must <em>rise from death, </em>before they begin to live. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(200)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceste facon de parler contient une metaphore prise des arbalestiers, ou autres qui visent au blanc</span>.” — “This way of speaking contains a metaphor, taken from archers, or others who aim at a mark.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(201)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La maitresse Pierre du coin, sur laquelle est fonde le salut de tous les enfans de Dieu</span>.” — “The head-stone of the corner, on which is founded the salvation of all the children of God.” </p></div></div>
