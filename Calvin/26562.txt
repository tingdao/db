<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>Lord, he already stinketh. </em>This is an indication of distrust, for she promises herself less from the power of Christ than she ought to have done. The root of the evil consists in measuring the infinite and incomprehensible power of God by the perception of her flesh. There being nothing more inconsistent with life than putrefaction and offensive smell, <em>Martha </em>infers that no remedy can be found. Thus, when our minds are preoccupied by foolish thoughts, we banish God from us, if we may be allowed the expression, so that he cannot accomplish in us his own work. Certainly, it was not owing to <em>Martha</em>, that her brother did not lie continually in the tomb, for she cuts off the expectation of life for him, and, at the same time, endeavors to hinder Christ from raising him; and yet nothing was farther from her intention. This arises from the weakness of faith. Distracted in various ways, we fight with ourselves, and while we stretch out the one hand to ask assistance from God, we repel, with the other hand, that very assistance, as soon as it is offered. <span class="cite-ref">(326)</span> True, <em>Martha </em>did not speak falsely, when she said, <em>I know that whatsoever thou shalt ask from God he will give thee</em>; but a confused faith is of little advantage, unless it be put in operation, when we come to a practical case. </p><p>We may also perceive in <em>Martha </em>how various are the effects of faith, even in the most excellent persons. She was the first that came to meet Christ; this was no ordinary proof of her piety; and yet she does not cease to throw difficulties in his way. That the grace of God may have access to us, let us learn to ascribe to it far greater power than our senses can comprehend; and, if the first and single promise of God has not sufficient weight with us, let us, at least, follow the example of Martha by giving our acquiescence, when he confirms us a second and third time. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(326)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceste mesme aide, si tost qu’il nous la presente</span>.” </p></div></div>
