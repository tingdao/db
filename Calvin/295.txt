<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>And Haran died</em>. Haran is said to have died before the face of his father; because he left his father the survivor. It is also said that he died in his country, that is, in Ur. The Jews turn the proper name into an appellative, and say that he died in the <em>fire</em>. For, as they are bold in forging fables, they pretend that he, with his brother Abram, were thrown by the Chaldeans into the fire, because they shunned idolatry; but that Abram escaped by the constancy of his faith. The twenty-fourth chapter of Joshua (<span class="bvs">Jos_24:1</span>,) however, which I have cited above, openly declares, that this whole family was not less infected with superstition than the country itself. I confess, indeed, that the name Ur is derived from fire: names, however, are wont to be assigned to cities, either from their situation, or from some particular event. It is possible that they there cherished the sacred fire, or that the splendor of the sun was more conspicuous than in other places. Others will have it, that the city was so named, because it was situated in a valley, for the Hebrews call valleys <span class="lang he-il">ארוים</span> (<em>Uraim </em><span class="cite-ref">(337)</span>) But there is no reason why we should be very anxious about such a matter: let it suffice, that Moses, speaking of the country of Abram immediately afterwards declares it to have been Ur of the Chaldeans. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(337)</span>Vide<em>Schindler</em>, sub voce <span class="lang he-il">אור</span>, col. 42, line 54; but it is doubtful whether any clear evidence of such a meaning of the word can be adduced. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
