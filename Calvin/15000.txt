<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>My lips shall rejoice </em><span class="cite-ref">(118)</span><em>when I sing to thee. </em>In this verse David expresses more distinctly his resolution not to give thanks to God hypocritically, nor in a superficial manner, but to engage with unfeigned earnestness in this religious exercise. By the figures which he introduces, he briefly teaches us, that to praise God would be the source of his greatest pleasure; and thus he indirectly censures the profane mirth of those who, forgetting God, confine their congratulations to themselves in their prosperity. The scope of the last verse is to the same effect, implying that no joy would be sweet and desirable to him, but such as was connected with the praises of God, and that to celebrate his Redeemer’s praises would afford him the greatest satisfaction and delight. </p><p><strong>(118)</strong> “The original word <span class="lang he-il">רנם</span> expresses a brisk, vibratory motion, like that of the lips in singing a lively air, or of the feet in dancing. Hence, figuratively, it signifies <em>to rejoice </em>or <em>exult </em>In this passage, it may be understood literally of <em>the lips</em>, and figuratively of the soul. And the English language having no corresponding verb which may be taken literally in reference to one subject, and figuratively in reference to another, it might be better to express its sense in connection with each, by two different verbs, thus: — </p><p>“My lips shall move briskly, when I sing unto thee, <LineBreak />And my soul shall rejoice, which thou, etc.” </p><p>— <em>Horsley</em>. </p></div>
