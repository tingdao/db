<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And the Lord said unto Moses. </em>By this command God made it known that He had performed a work which not only ought to be celebrated by word <span class="cite-ref">(192)</span> of mouth, but which also was deserving of eternal glory with posterity; for therefore did He command it to be written in a book, that its memory might never perish. The dispute of commentators respecting this book seems to me to be superfluous; for God simply wills that the memorial of this circumstance should exist in all ages; and this was effected by the narration of Moses, for he handed down in writing even to the end of the world the praise of this favor, together with the perpetual and immortal doctrine of the Law. Yet God did not only wish the memorable event of this battle to be written down, but also that Joshua should be reminded of it, lest he should faint under the many difficulties which awaited him. For nothing could better support him with invincible firmness than the recollection of this history, from whence he might be assured that the people would ever be victorious under the auspices of God. But although this promise was not immediately fulfilled, yet the Amalekites were a long time afterwards totally destroyed by Saul; but it was a great encouragement to Joshua and the people to know that Amalek, who had first made war upon them, was already condemned by the divine decree, and could not escape the destruction to which he was devoted. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(192)</span> “Par la bouche de ceux qui vivoyent alors;” by the mouth of those who were alive then. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
