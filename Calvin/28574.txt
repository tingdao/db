<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Neither be ye idolaters </em>He touches upon the history that is recorded in <span class="bvs">Exo_32:7</span>, etc. For when Moses made a longer stay upon the mountain than the unseemly fickleness of the people could endure, Aaron was constrained to make a calf, and set it up as an object of worship. Not that the people wished to change their God, but rather to have some visible token of God’s presence, in accordance with their carnal apprehension. God, in punishing at that time this idolatry with the greatest severity, showed by that example how much he abhors idolatry. </p><p><em>As it is written, The people sat down </em>This passage is rightly interpreted by few, for they understand intemperance among the people to have been the occasion of wantonness, <span class="cite-ref">(542)</span> in accordance with the common proverb, “Dancing comes after a full diet.” <span class="cite-ref">(543)</span> But Moses speaks of a sacred feast, or in other words, what they celebrated in honor of the idol. Hence <em>feasting </em>and <em>play </em>were two appendages of idolatry. For it was customary, both among the people of Israel and among the rotaries of superstition, to have a feast in connection with a sacrifice, as a part of divine worship, at which no profane or unclean persons were allowed to be present. The Gentiles, in addition to this, appointed sacred games in honor of their idols, in conformity with which the Israelites doubtless on that occasion worshipped their calf, <span class="cite-ref">(544)</span> for such is the presumption of the human mind, that it ascribes to God whatever pleases itself. Hence the Gentiles have fallen into such a depth of infatuation as to believe, that their gods are delighted with the basest spectacles, immodest dances, impurity of speech, and every kind of obscenity. Hence in imitation of them the Israelitish people, having observed their sacred banquet, rose up to celebrate the games, that nothing might be wanting in honor of the idol. This is the true and simple meaning. </p><p>But here it is asked, why the Apostle makes mention of the feast and the games, rather than of adoration, for this is the chief thing in idolatry, while the other two things were merely appendages. The reason is, that he has selected what best suited the case of the Corinthians. For it is not likely, that they frequented the assemblies of the wicked, for the purpose of prostrating themselves before the idols, but partook of their feasts, held in honor of their deities, and did not keep at a distance from those base ceremonies, which were tokens of idolatry. It is not therefore without good reason that the Apostle declares, that their particular form of offense is expressly condemned by God. He intimates, in short, that no part of idolatry <span class="cite-ref">(545)</span> can be touched without contracting pollution, and that those will not escape punishment from the hand of God, who defile themselves with the outward tokens of idolatry. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(542)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et esgayement desborde</span>;” — “And unbridled excess.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(543)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Apres la panse vient la danse</span>;” — “After dinner comes the dance.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(544)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et ne faut point douter que les Israelites n’ayent pour lots adore leur veau auec telle ceremonie et obseruation que les Gentils faisoyent leurs idoles</span>;” — “And we cannot doubt, that the Israelites on that occasion adored their calf with the same ceremony and care as the Gentiles did their idols. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(545)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tant petite soit elle</span>;” — “Be it ever so little.” </p></div></div>
