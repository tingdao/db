<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth. </em>Others translate <em>it, </em>— “Whosoever toucheth an unclean thing shall be unclean.” for, since the Hebrew is without a neuter gender, <span class="cite-ref">(26)</span> the relative <span class="lang he-il">אשר</span>, <em>asher, </em>and the noun <span class="lang he-il">הטמא</span><em>, hattame, </em>may be either masculine or neuter; and either sense would not be unsuitable; except that we gather from the second clause, that reference is rather made here to the contagion with which unclean persons infect either men or garments, or other articles. For those who had touched a dead body, or bones, or a grave, were not only unclean until the evening, but for seven entire days. But it appears that this was added in conclusion, lest the Jews should murmur at the severity of the punishment, as if God would inflict the penalty of death for a trifling sin. In this way, then, Moses shews how great is the guilt incurred by those who, being unclean, intrude into the sanctuary; because, as far as in them lies, they pollute the holiness of God, and not without intolerable impertinence. Hence appears to be taken the reproof of the Prophet, when he reproaches the Jews with having done nothing but defile the worship of God with their sacrifices; for he proposes this question to the priests, — “If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy?” After they have replied in the negative, he asks again, “If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean?” and they answer, “It shall be unclean.” Whence the Prophet infers: </p><p>"So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord, and so is the work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.” (<span class="bvs">Hag_2:12</span>.) </p><p>This passage shews us the legitimate use of the ceremony, that corrupt and perverse worshippers <span class="cite-ref">(27)</span> bring disgrace rather than honor on God, whilst they mix up His holy name with their profanations. </p><p><strong>(26)</strong><em>S.M</em>. had used the words cited by <em>C</em>. “Quicunque tetigerit immundum;” but <em>C</em>. appears to have overlooked his note upon this clause, viz., “Hoc est, qui tetigerit hominem, qui super mortuo est immundus;” or else he would have seen that <em>immundum </em> was not meant for a neuter. — <em>W</em>. </p><p><strong>(27)</strong> “<em class="lang fr-fr">Ceux </em><span class="lang fr-fr">qui servent a Dieu sans droite affection, and par hypocrisie</span>;” those who serve God without right affections, and in hypocrisy. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
