<div class="comment-content"><p>God shows here, that though the Chaldeans insolently exulted for a time, yet their joy would not continue; and at the same time he points out the cause of their ruin, even because they dealt so arrogantly with the people of God. He then says in the former clause, <em>Ye exulted and rejoiced in plundering my heritage; </em>and then he adds, <em>Ye became fat </em>(for to be multiplied means here to become fat) <em>as a heifer, </em>well fed, or <em>of the grass; </em>for some think that the word is used for <span class="lang he-il">דשאה</span>, <em>deshae; </em>but some render it, “herbified,” or fed on grass; while others derive the word from <span class="lang he-il">דוש</span>, <em>dush, </em>to thresh or tread out corn. <span class="cite-ref">(56)</span> It is then added, <em>Ye neighed like strong horses, </em>or ye bellowed like bulls, as some render the words; for <span class="lang he-il">אבירים</span>, <em>abirim, </em>sometimes mean bulls, and sometimes strong horses; and the verb <span class="lang he-il">צהל</span>, <em>tzal, </em>means to cry aloud, but is taken sometimes in the sense of neighing, as we have seen in <span class="bvs">Jer_5:0</span>, “Every one neigheth on his neighbor’s wife;” the Prophet said so in condemning the people for their lusts; and they who apply this passage to bulls are obliged to change the meaning of the verb — for bellowing, and not neighing, is what belongs to bulls. <span class="cite-ref">(57)</span></p><p>Now it was necessary, for two reasons, for the Prophet to speak thus; first, it was hardly credible, that the Chaldeans, after so many and so remarkable victories, could be broken down and laid prostrate by new enemies; for they had been terrible to the whole world, they had subdued all their neighbors, they had extended on all sides their borders; it was then the same as though they had set their nest in the clouds. Then the Prophet says here, that though they exulted and gave loose reins to their joy, yet this state of things would not be perpetual, because they should at length be brought to shame. This is one thing. And the second reason why the Prophet spoke thus was, because God intended that it should be testified to his own people, that though he permitted so much liberty to the Chaldeans, he had not yet forgotten his covenant; and for this reason he mentioned the word heritage. Though then the calamity of his people was apparently a sort of repudiation, as though God designed to have nothing more to do with them, yet he says that they were his own heritage; and thus he shows, that God would give a specimen of his favor towards the Jews, by thus severely chastising the Chaldeans. This then is the reason why he says, <em>Ye have rejoiced in plundering my heritage, but your mother is ashamed. </em>He expresses here more than if he had said, “Ye shall at length lie down confounded with shame;” but he names their mother, that he might intimate the destruction of the whole of that monarchy, which had been so terrible to all the neighboring nations. <span class="cite-ref">(58)</span></p><p><strong>(56)</strong> Several copies have <span class="lang he-il">דשה</span>, threshing. Being allowed to eat at pleasure, the threshing heifer became fat and frisky. It is so taken by <em>Blayney </em>and <em>Henderson, </em>though not countenanced by the Versions or the <em>Targ. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(57)</strong> Jeremiah having twice before (<span class="bvs">Jer_8:16</span>; <span class="bvs">Jer_47:3</span>) used the word for steeds or horses, we may conclude that he means the same here. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(58)</strong> The connection of these two verses will be more evident, if we render <span class="lang he-il">כי</span><em>when, </em>as proposed by <em>Gataker, </em>and not <em>surely, </em>as by <em>Calvin, </em>nor <em>because, </em>as in our version, — </p><p><strong>11.</strong>When ye shall rejoice, when ye shall exult, Ye plunderers of mine heritage, When ye shall skip as a fed heifer, And neigh like steeds, </p><p><strong>12.</strong>Ashamed greatly <em>shall be </em>your mother, Confounded <em>shall </em>she be who bare you; Behold, the last of the nations <em>shall she be, </em>A desert, a dry land, and a wilderness. </p><p>The reference seems to be to the rejoicings of Babylon, when it was taken. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
