<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>If it be in your mind</em>. Abraham constitutes them his advocates with Ephron, to persuade him to sell the double cave. <span class="cite-ref">(456)</span> Some suppose the cave to have been so formed that one part was above, and the other below. Let every one be at liberty to adopt what opinion he pleases; I, however, rather suppose, that there was one entrance, but that within, the cave was divided by a middle partition. It is more pertinent to remarks that Abraham, by offering a full price, cultivated and maintained equity. Where is there one to be found, who, in buying, and in other business, does not eagerly pursue his own advantage at another’s cost? For while the seller sets the price at twice the worth of a thing, that he may extort as much as possible from the buyer, and the buyers in return, by shuffling, attempts to reduce it to a low price, there is no end of bargaining. And although avarice has specious pretexts, it yet causes those who make contracts with each other, to forget the claims of equity and justice. This also, finally deserves to be noticed; that Abraham often declares that he was buying the field for a place of sepulture. And Moses is the more minute in this matter, that we may learn, with our father Abraham, to raise our minds to the hope of the resurrection. He saw the half of himself taken away; but because he was certain that his wife was not exiled from the kingdom of God, he hides her dead body in the tomb, until he and she should be gathered together. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(456)</span> Hebrews <span class="lang he-il">מערח המכפלה</span>, (<em>mearath hummakpelah</em>,) ‘the double cave.’ See <em>Septuagint </em>Our translators have preferred rendering the word <em>Machpelah </em>as a proper name. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
