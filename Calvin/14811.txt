<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Thou hast showed thy people hard things </em>He says, first, that the nation had been dealt with severely, and then adds a figure which may additionally represent the grievousness of its calamities, speaking of it as drunk with the wine of stupor or astonishment. Even the Hebraist interpreters are not agreed among themselves as to the meaning of <span class="lang he-il">תרעלה</span>, <em>tarelah, </em>which I have rendered <em>astonishment. </em>Several of them translate it <em>poison. </em>But it is evident that the Psalmist alludes to some kind of poisoned drink, which deprives a person of his senses, insinuating that the Jews were stupified by their calamities. <span class="cite-ref">(383)</span> He would place, in short, before their eyes the curse of God, which had pressed upon the government of Saul, and induce them to abandon their obstinate attempts to maintain the interests of a throne which lay under the divine reprobation. </p><p><strong>(383)</strong> It was customary among the Hebrews to make their wine stronger and more inebriating by the addition of hotter and more powerful ingredients; such as honey, spices, <em>defrutum </em>, (<em>i e</em>. , wine inspissated by boiling it down to two-thirds or one-half of the quantity,) mandrakes, opiates, and other drugs. Such were the stupifying ingredients which the celebrated Helen is represented, in Homer’s Odyssey, as mixing in the bowl, together with the wine, for her guests oppressed with grief, to raise their spirits; and such is probably the wine to which there is here an allusion. The people were stupified by the heavy judgments of God, like a person stupified with wine which had been rendered more intoxicating by the deleterious drugs with which it had been mingled. This highly poetical language is not unfrequently employed to express the divine judgments: as in <span class="bvs">Isa_51:17</span>, and <span class="bvs">Jer_25:15</span>. The original word <span class="lang he-il">תרעלה</span>,<em>tarelah</em>, means properly <em>trembling</em>, from the verb <span class="lang he-il">רעל</span>,<em>raal</em>, from which the English word <em>reel </em>is perhaps derived. We might therefore read, “the wine of trembling.” </p></div>
