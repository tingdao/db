<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet denounces a punishment, though the Jews thought that they deserved a reward. The case is the same with the Papists at this day, who thoughtlessly boast, when they heap together many abominations; for they think that God is bound as it were by a law, not to overlook so much diligence. But the Prophet shews how grossly deceived they are who worship God superstitiously, without the authority of his word; for he threatens them here with the heaviest judgment, — <em>Called no more, </em>he says, <em>shall it be Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom; but The valley of slaughter shall it be called; </em>for the whole land was to be filled with slaughters. </p><p>He adds, <em>Bury shall they </em>there, for elsewhere <em>there will be no place </em><span class="cite-ref">(213)</span> He intimates that so great would be the slaughters, that Jerusalem would not contain the dead: hence, he says, graves will be made in Tophet; and many also will be slain there. A dead body, we know, was unclean by the Law; and it was not lawful to offer sacrifices to God near graves. (<span class="bvs">Num_19:11</span>.) The Prophet then shows, that when the Jews foolishly consecrated that place to God, they committed a dreadful profanation, for that place was to be wholly filled with dead bodies, and polluted also by the slaughter of men. We hence see what the superstitious do when they follow their own devices — that they provoke God’s wrath; for by the grievousness of the punishment we may form a judgment as to the degree in which God abominates all false modes of worship, which men devise without the warrant of his law; for we must ever remember this principle, <em>I commanded it not, nor hath it ever come to my mind </em>It follows — </p><p><strong>(213)</strong> This is the meaning according to all the ancient versions and the <em>Targum</em>. The <em>Syriac </em>is, “for want of place.” <em>Gataker </em>gives the same meaning. Our version follows <em>Pagninus, </em>and is substantially adopted by <em>Blayney </em>both here and in <span class="bvs">Jer_19:11</span>. Literally it is, “From no place,“ that is, “From there being no place,“ as <em>Calvin </em>says elsewhere. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
