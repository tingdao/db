<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>42.</strong><em>Watch therefore. </em>In Luke the exhortation is more pointed, or, at least, more special, <em>Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and the cares of this life. </em>And certainly he who, by living in intemperance, has his senses overloaded with food and wine, will never elevate his mind to meditation on the heavenly life. But as there is no desire of the flesh that does not intoxicate a man, they ought to take care, in all these respects, not to satiate themselves with the world, if they wish to advance with speed to the kingdom of Christ. The single word <em>watch </em>— which we find in Matthew — denotes that uninterrupted attention which keeps our minds in full activity, and makes us pass through the world like pilgrims. </p><p>In the account given by <em>Mark, </em>the disciples are first enjoined to <em>take heed </em>lest, through carelessness or indolence, ruin overtake them; and next are commanded to <em>watch, </em>because various allurements of the flesh are continually creeping upon us, and lulling our minds to sleep. Next follows an exhortation to <em>prayer, </em>because it is necessary to seek elsewhere the supplies that are necessary for supporting our weakness. Luke dictates the very form <em>of prayer; </em>first, that God may be pleased to rescue us from so deep and intricate a labyrinth; and next, that he may present us safe and sound in presence of his Son; for we shall never be able to reach it but by miraculously escaping innumerable deaths. And as it was not enough to pass through the course of the present life by rising superior to all dangers, Christ places this as the most important, that we may be permitted to stand before his tribunal. </p><p><em>For you know not at what hour your Lord will come. </em>It ought to be observed, that the uncertainty as to the time of Christ’s coming — which almost all treat as an encouragement to sloth — ought to be felt by us to be an excitement to attention and watchfulness. God intended that it should be hidden from us, for the express purpose that we may keep diligent watch without the relaxation of a single hour. For what would be the trial of faith and patience, if believers, after spending their whole life in ease, and indolence, and pleasure, were to prepare themselves within the space of three days for meeting Christ? </p></div>
