<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor</em>. Because many, under the pretext of conscientiousness, are not only rigid censors of others, but also burst out in the open proclamation of their defects, Moses seeks to prevent this preposterous zeal, shewing how they may best restrain it, not by encouraging sin through their connivance or silence, whilst they are still far from evil-speaking. For those who labor under this disease of carping and vituperating, are wont to object that sins are nourished by silence, unless all are eager in reproving them; and hence their ardor in exclaiming against them and deriding them. But Moses points out a more useful remedy, that they should bring back wanderers into the way by private rebukes, and not by publishing their offenses. For whosoever triumphs in the infamy of his brother, precipitates his ruin as far as in him lies; whereas a well-regulated zeal consults the welfare of one who is ruining himself. Therefore we are commanded to rebuke the wandering, and not to regard our brethren as enemies. A similar course is prescribed by Christ, “If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.” ( <span class="bvs">Mat_18:15</span>.) In fine, an immoderate love of fault-finding will always be found to be arrogant and cruel. The word <span class="lang he-il">נשא</span>, <em>nasa</em>, undoubtedly means to publish what was concealed, and thus by exposure to drive to despair those who would else have been corrigible. </p></div>
