<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Thus says the whole congregation, </em>etc Just as if it had been known that this second altar was opposed to the one only altar of God, they begin with upbraiding them, and that in a very harsh and severe manner. They thus assume it as confessed, that the two tribes had built the altar with a view of offering sacrifices upon it. In this they are mistaken, as it was destined for a different use and purpose. Moreover, had the idea which they had conceived been correct, all the expostulation which they employ would have been just; for it was a clear case of criminal revolt to make any change in the Law of God, who values obedience more than all sacrifices, (<span class="bvs">1Sa_15:22</span>) and there would have been perfect ground for condemning them as apostates, in withdrawing from the one only altar. </p></div>
