<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And came and preached peace. </em>All that Christ had done towards effecting a reconciliation would have been of no service, if it had not been proclaimed by the gospel; and therefore he adds, that the fruit of this peace has now been offered both to Jews and to Gentiles. Hence it follows, that to save Gentiles as well as Jews was the design of our Savior’s coming, as the preaching of the gospel, which is addressed indiscriminately to both, makes abundantly manifest. The same order is followed in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. </p><p>“He hath committed to us the word of reconciliation. Now, then, we are ambassadors for Christ. For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin.” (<span class="bvs">2Co_5:18</span>.) </p><p>Salvation through the death of Christ is first announced, and a description is afterwards given of the manner in which Christ communicates to us himself and the benefit of his death. But here Paul dwells chiefly on this circumstance, that Gentiles are united with Jews in the Kingdom of God. Having already represented Christ as a Savior common to both, he now speaks of them as companions in the gospel. The Jews, though they possessed the law, needed the gospel also; and God had bestowed upon the Gentiles equal grace. Those therefore whom </p><p>“God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_19:6</span>.) </p><p>No reference to distance of place is conveyed by the words <em>afar off </em>and <em>nigh. </em>The Jews, in respect of the covenant, were <em>nigh </em>to God. The Gentiles, so long as they had no promise of salvation, were <em>afar off </em>— were banished from the kingdom of God. </p><p><em>And preached peace; </em>not indeed by his own lips, but by the apostles. It was necessary that Christ should rise from the dead, before the Gentiles were called to the fellowship of grace. Hence that saying of our Lord, </p><p>“I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_15:24</span>.) </p><p>The apostles were forbidden, while he was still in the world, to carry their first embassy to the Gentiles. </p><p>“Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans, enter ye not. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:5</span>,) </p><p>His apostles were afterwards employed as trumpets for proclaiming the gospel to the Gentiles. What they did, not only in his name, and by his command, but as it were in his own person, is justly ascribed to none other than himself. We too speak as if Christ himself exhorted you by us. (<span class="bvs">2Co_5:20</span>) The faith of the gospel would be weak indeed, were we to look no higher than to men. Its whole authority is derived from viewing men as God’s instruments, and hearing Christ speak to us by their mouth. Observe here, the gospel is the message of <em>peace, </em>by which God declares himself to be reconciled to us, and makes known his paternal love. Take away the gospel, and war and enmity continue to subsist between God and men; and, on the other hand, the native tendency of the gospel is, to give peace and calmness to the conscience, which would otherwise be tormented by distressing alarm. </p></div>
