<div class="comment-content"><p>He then says, that <em>the word of Jehovah came to him</em>; <span class="cite-ref">(78)</span> we hence learn, that this was a distinct prophecy. He adds, <em>I have been zealous for Sion </em>(for as we have said, the letter <span class="lang he-il">ל</span>, <em>lamed</em>, is to be thus taken) <em>with great zeal </em><span class="cite-ref">(79)</span> This was indeed an incredible change, for God had for a time restrained himself, while the ungodly at their pleasure harassed the Church, so that they thought that they could do so with impunity. As God then had for some time remained at rest, what the Prophet says here could not have been easily believed, that is, that God would, through a sudden jealousy, undertake the cause of the Church. Hence the indignation, immediately subjoined, must be regarded with reference to enemies, as though he had said, that all the ungodly would now perceive what they had by no means expected, — that God was the protector of Jerusalem. It now follows — </p><p><strong>(78)</strong> Many MSS. have [<span class="lang he-il">אלי</span> ], “to me,” after “hosts,” a reading confirmed by the <em>Targum</em>, <em>Syriac</em>, and the <em>Septuagint</em>. Barb. MS.; and it is no doubt the true one.—<em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(79)</strong><em>Newcome </em>has followed our version. The rendering of <em>Henderson </em>is the same with that of <em>Calvin</em>, — </p><p>I have been zealous for Zion with great zeal. </p><p>The comparison is evidently what <em>Calvin </em>refers to above; it is the jealousy of a husband for the honor of his wife. <em>Blayney </em>has no good reason for saying that this verse refers to what was past, and the following to the state of things at that time; for the verbs in both instances are in the same tense, the perfect, which often includes the present, that is, the perfect up to the present time; as the future in Hebrew, and also in Welsh, includes the present as well as what is to come. If we say, “I have been jealous,” etc., we must add in the next verse, “I have returned,” etc. But it would be better in our language to use in both instances the present tense, “I am jealous,” etc., and, “I am retained,” etc. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
