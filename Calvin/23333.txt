<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>From their fruits you shall know them </em>Had not this mark of distinction been added, we might have called in question the authority of all teachers without exception. If there is a mortal danger to be dreaded in teachers, and if we see no way of avoiding it, we shall be under the necessity of holding them all suspected: and there will be no better or shorter method than to keep our ears shut against them all. We see that ungodly men, to screen themselves when rejecting every kind of doctrine, hold out this danger, and that weak and ill-informed persons remain in a state of perplexity. That our reverence for the Gospel, and for its faithful ministers and teachers, may not be diminished, Christ enjoins us to form our opinion of the <em>false prophets from their fruits </em>It is with a very bad grace that the Papists, in order to excite hatred against us, quote directly this exhortation of Christ, <em>Beware of false prophets, </em>and by their clamors induce ignorant people to avoid us, without knowing why. But whoever desires to follow our Lord’s advice must judge wisely and with just discretion. For ourselves, we not only acknowledge freely that men ought to <em>beware of false prophets, </em>but we carefully and earnestly exhort simple people to <em>beware </em>of them. Only we warn them that, agreeably to the rule which Christ has laid down, they should first make a strict examination, that simple people may not reject the pure Word of God, and suffer the punishment of their own rashness. There is a wide difference between wise caution and perverse squeamishness. <span class="cite-ref">(476)</span> It is a heinous wickedness in the Papists to repeal the command of Christ, by infusing into unhappy persons an unfounded dread, <span class="cite-ref">(477)</span> which deters them from making inquiry. Let this be regarded by us as a first principl that those who tremblingly reject or avoid a doctrine unknown to them, act improperly, and are very far from obeying the command of Christ. </p><p>It now remains to be seen, what are the <em>fruits </em>which Christ points out. Those who confine them to the life are, in my opinion, mistaken. As pretended sanctity, and I know not what masks belonging to greater austerity of life, are frequently held out by some of the worst impostors, this would be a very uncertain test. Their hypocrisy, I do own, is at length discovered; for nothing is more difficult than to counterfeit virtue. But Christ did not intend to submit his doctrine to a decision so unjust in itself, and so liable to be misunderstood, as to have it estimated by the life of men. Under the <em>fruits </em>the <em>manner of teaching </em>is itself included, and indeed holds the chief place: for Christ proves that he was sent by God from this consideration, that </p><p><em>“ </em>he seeketh not his own glory, <LineBreak />but the glory of the Father who sent him<em>,” </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_7:18</span>.) </p><p>Is it objected, that few persons are endued with such acuteness, as to distinguish <em>good fruits </em>from <em>bad? </em>I answer, as I have already said: Believers are never deprived of the Spirit of wisdom, where his assistance is needful, provided they distrust themselves, renounce their own judgment, and give themselves up wholly to his direction. Let us remember, however, that all doctrines must be brought to the Word of God as the standard, and that, in judging <em>of false prophets, </em>the rule of faith holds the chief place. We must also consider what God enjoins on his prophets and the ministers of his word: for in this way their faithfulness may be easily ascertained. If, for example, we place before our minds what Paul requires in <em>bishops, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:1</span>; <strong>Titus 1:6-9</strong>,) that description will be sufficient of itself to condemn the whole mass of Popery: for the Popish priests seem as if they purposely intended to present an opposite picture. There is no reason to wonder, therefore, if they forbid men to form a judgment of false prophets. But this passage clearly shows, that their titles ought to go for nothing, and that not much regard ought to be had even to their calling, if those who receive the name of pastors, and are called to the office of teachers, do not faithfully answer to their charge. </p><p><em>Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? </em>By these proverbs, which were then in common use and universally received, Christ confirms his statement, that no man can be deceived by <em>false prophets, </em>unless he is wilfully blind: for the <em>fruits </em>as plainly discover upright servants of God, and unfaithful workmen, as the <em>fruits </em>point out the nature of the tree. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(476)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il y a grande difference entre une bonne facon de se donner garde d'estre trompe, et un deboutement temeraire sans savoir pourquoy</span>.” — “There is a great difference between a proper method of guarding against being deceived, and a hasty rejection without knowing, why.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(477)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par une vaine crainte, qu'ils leur proposent</span>;” — “by a vain dread which they hold out to them.” </p></div></div>
