<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>The husband to the wife. </em>He now prescribes the rules to be observed in the marriage connection, or he teaches what is the duty of husband and wife. And in the first place he lays down a general doctrine as to mutual benevolence — that the husband love his wife, and the wife her husband; for as to the interpretation which others give to the expression <em>due benevolence </em>— duty of marriage — I do not know how far it is suitable. The reason that inclines them to this view is, that it is immediately added, <em>The husband has not power of his own body</em>, etc.; but it will suit better to regard that as an inference drawn from the preceding statement. Husband and wife, therefore, are bound to mutual benevolence: hence it follows, that they have, neither the one nor the other,<em>the power of their own body. </em>But it may be asked, why the Apostle here puts them upon a level, instead of requiring from the wife obedience and subjection. I answer, that it was not his intention to treat of all their duties, but simply of the mutual obligation as to the marriage bed. In other things, therefore, husband and wife differ, both as to duty and as to authority in this respect the condition of both is alike — as to the maintaining of conjugal fidelity. For this reason, also, polygamy (<span class="lang el-gr">τολυγαμία</span>) is again condemned; for if this is an invariable condition of marriage, that the husband surrenders <em>the power of his own body, </em>and gives it up to his wife, how could he afterwards connect himself with another, as if he were free? </p></div>
