It might indeed have happened to the captives that the king should order them to be slain, but it could not have occurred to any man to suppose what Jeremiah declares, that they would be <em>roasted </em><span class="cite-ref">(220)</span><em>in the fire </em>We hence see that God here obviates the evasions of perverse minds, so that there would be no room for evading, when he specifies the very kind of death which they were to undergo. </p><p>But he says first, <em>Taken from them shall be a curse, </em>that is, the form of cursing. Mentioned yesterday was <span class="lang he-il">אלה</span>, <em>ale, </em>an oath; he puts down now <span class="lang he-il">קללה</span>, <em>kolle; </em>and <span class="lang he-il">קלל</span>, <em>koll, </em>is to curse. The meaning then is, that they would become an exemplar of a curse to all the captives, who would say, <em>May God make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab whom the king of Babylon roasted </em>The cause of their death is again repeated; and the Prophet did not without reason dwell on this, that he might turn away the eyes of the people from the immediate cause, which was commonly known, that is, that Nebuchadnezzar would not endure any tumults to be raised in his dominions; that they might therefore acknowledge God to be the author of this punishment, he says, — </p><p><strong>(220)</strong> “Fried” is the word used by the Sept., the Vulg., the Syr., and the Targ.
