<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet now briefly includes what he had been teaching, what he had been commanded to declare to the people. No doubt he spoke to them more at large; but he deemed it enough to shew in a few words what had been committed to him. And the sum of it was, that except the Jews so hearkend as to walk in God’s Law, and were submissive to the prophets, final ruin was nigh the Temple and the city. This is the meaning: but it may be useful to consider every particular. </p><p>By these words, <em>Except ye hearken to me, to walk in my law, </em>God intimates, that he mainly requires obedience, and esteems nothing as much, according to what he says, that it is better than all sacrifices. (<span class="bvs">1Sa_15:22</span>.) This subject was largely treated in the seventh chapter, where he said, </p><p>“Did I command your fathers when they came out of Egypt to offer sacrifices to me? this only I required, even to hear my voice.” (<span class="bvs">Jer_7:22</span>) </p><p>We hence see, that the only way of living piously, justly, holily, and uprightly, is to allow ourselves to be ruled by the Lord. This is one thing. Then what follows is worthy of being noticed, <em>To walk in my law </em>God here testifies that his will is not ambiguous or doubtful, for he has prescribed what is right in his law. Were God then to descend a hundred times from heaven, he would bring nothing but this message, that he has spoken what is necessary to be known, and that his Law is the most perfect wisdom. Had he said only, “Hear me,” men might have still evaded and avowed themselves ready to learn. God therefore does here silence hypocrites, and says that he required nothing else but to follow his Law. And for the same purpose he adds what follows, <em>which I have set before you: </em>for this kind of speaking intimates that the doctrine of the Law was by no means obscure or doubtful, as Moses said, </p><p>“I this day call heaven and earth to witness, that I have set life and death before your eyes.” (<span class="bvs">Deu_30:19</span>) </p><p>And in another place he said, </p><p>“Say not, Who shall ascend above the clouds? or, Who shall descend into the abyss? or, Who shall pass beyond the sea? The word is in thy heart and in thy mouth,” (<span class="bvs">Deu_30:12</span>; <span class="bvs">Rom_10:6</span>) </p><p>as though he had said, “God has deprived you of every excuse, for there is no reason for doubting, since he has spoken so familiarly to you, and has explained everything necessary to be known.” </p><p>And hereby is confuted the impious blasphemy of the Papists, who impudently assert that not only the Law is obscure, but also the Gospel. And Paul also loudly declares, that the Gospel is not obscure except to those who perish, and who have a veil over their hearts, being visited with judicial blindness. But as to the Law, in which there is no such plainness as in the Gospel, we see what Jeremiah affirms here, that it was set before the eyes of all, that they might learn from it what pleased God, and what was just and right. </p></div>
