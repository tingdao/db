<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And he removed from thence</em>. When we hear that Abram moved from the place where he had built an altar to God, we ought not to doubt that he was, by some necessity, compelled to do so. He there found the inhabitants unpropitious; and therefore transfers his tabernacle elsewhere. But if Abram bore his continual wanderings patiently, our fastidiousness is utterly inexcusable, when we murmur against God, if he does not grant us a quiet nest. Certainly, when Christ has opened heaven to us, and daily invites us thither to dwell with himself; we should not take it amiss, if he chooses that we should be strangers in the world. The sum of the passage is this, that Abram was without a settled residence: <span class="cite-ref">(347)</span> which title Paul assigns to Christians, (<span class="bvs">1Co_4:11</span>.) Moreover, there is a manifest prolepsis in the word Bethel; for Moses gives the place this name, to accommodate his discourse to the men of his own age. </p><p><em>And there he builded an altar</em>. Moses commends in Abram his unwearied devotedness to piety: for by these words, he intimates, that whatever place he visited, he there exercised himself in the external worship of God; both that he might have no religious rites in common with the wicked, and that he might retain his family in sincere piety. And it is probable, that, from this cause, he would be the object of no little enmity; because there is nothing which more enrages the wicked, than religion different from their own, in which they conceive themselves to be not only despised, but altogether condemned as blind. And we know that the Canaanites were cruel and proud, and too ready to avenge insults. This was perhaps the reason of Abram’s frequent removals: that his neighbors regarded the altars which he built, as a reproach to themselves. It ought indeed to be referred to the wonderful favor of God, that he was not often stoned. Nevertheless, since the holy man knows that he is justly required to bear testimony that he has a God peculiarly his own, whom he must not, by dissimulation, virtually deny, <span class="cite-ref">(348)</span> he therefore does not hesitate to prefer the glory of God to his own life. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(347)</span><span class="lang el-gr">Αστατόυμενος</span></p><p><span class="cite-note">(348)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Ut testetur se peculiarem habere Deum.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il testife avoir un autre Dieu que celui qui estoit la adore</span> :” to testify that he has another God than that which was there adored. — <em>French Tr </em></p></div></div>
