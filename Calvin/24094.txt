<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>And he went forward a little. </em>We have seen in other passages, that in order to excite himself to greater earnestness of prayer, the Lord prayed in the absence of witnesses; for when we are withdrawn from the gaze of men, we succeed better in collecting our senses, so as to attend more closely to what we are doing. It is not, indeed, necessary — nay more, it is not always proper — that we should retire to distant corners whenever we pray; but when some great necessity urges us, because the fervor of prayer is more freely indulged when we are alone, it is useful to us to pray apart. And if the Son of God did not disregard this aid, it would be the greatest madness of pride in us not to apply it for our own advantage. Add to this, that when God alone is witness, as there is nothing then to be feared from ambition, the believing soul unfolds itself with greater familiarity, and with greater simplicity pours its wishes, and groans, and anxieties, and fears, and hopes, and joys, into the bosom of God. God allows his people to make use of many little modes of speaking, when they pray alone, which, in the presence of men, would savor of ostentation. </p><p><em>And fell on his face. </em>By the very gesture <em>of falling </em>on the earth, Christ manifested his deep earnestness in prayer. For though <em>kneeling, </em>as our expression of respect and reverence, is commonly used in prayer, Christ, by throwing himself on the ground as a suppliant, placed himself in a pitiable attitude on account of the vehemence of his grief. </p><p><em>My Father, if it be possible. </em>In vain do some persons labor to show that what is here described is not a prayer, but only a complaint. For my own part, while I own that it is abrupt, I have no doubt that Christ offered a prayer. Nor is it inconsistent with this, that he asks a thing that is impossible to be granted to him; for the prayers of believers do not always flow on with uninterrupted progress to the end, do not always maintain a uniform measure, are not always arranged even in a distinct order, but, on the contrary, are involved and confused, and either oppose each other, or stop in the middle of the course; like a vessel tossed by tempests, which, though it advances towards the harbor, cannot always keep a straight and uniform course, as in a calm sea. We must remember, indeed, what I lately mentioned, that Christ had not confused emotions, like those to which we are accustomed, to withdraw his mind from pure moderation; but, so far as the pure and innocent nature of man could admit, he was struck with fear and seized with anguish, so that, amidst the violent shocks of temptation, he vacillated—as it were—from one wish to another. This is the reason why, after having prayed to be freed from death, he immediately restrains himself, and, submitting to the authority of the Father, corrects and recalls that wish which had suddenly escaped him. </p><p>But it may be asked, How did he pray that the eternal decree of the Father, of which he was not ignorant, should be revoked? or though he states a condition, <em>if it be possible, </em>yet it wears an aspect of absurdity to make the purpose of God changeable. We must hold it to be utterly impossible for God to revoke his decree. According to Mark, too, Christ would seem to contrast the power of God with his decree. <em>All things, says </em>he, <em>are possible to thee. </em>But it would be improper to extend the power of God so far as to lessen his truth, by making him liable to variety and change. I answer, There would be no absurdity in supposing that Christ, agreeably to the custom of the godly, leaving out of view the divine purpose, committed to the bosom of the Father his desire which troubled him. For believers, in pouring out their prayers, do not always ascend to the contemplation of the secrets of God, or deliberately inquire what is possible to be done, but are sometimes carried away hastily by the earnestness of their wishes. Thus Moses prays that he may be <em>blotted out of the book of life, </em>(<span class="bvs">Exo_32:33</span>;) thus Paul <em>wished to be made an anathema, </em><span class="cite-ref">(201)</span> (<span class="bvs">Rom_9:3</span>.) This, therefore, was not a premeditated prayer of Christ; but the strength and violence of grief suddenly drew this word from his mouth, to which he immediately added a correction. The same vehemence of desire took away from him the immediate recollection of the heavenly decree, so that he did not at that moment reflect, that it was on this condition, <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span> that he was sent to be the Redeemer of mankind; as distressing anxiety often brings darkness over our eyes, so that we do not at once remember the whole state of the matter. In short, there is no impropriety, if in prayer we do not always direct our immediate attention to every thing, so as to preserve a distinct order. When Christ says, in the Gospel by Matthew, that <em>all things are possible to God, </em>he does not intend by these words to bring the power of God into conflict with unchangeable truth and firmness; but as there was no hope—which is usually the case when affairs are desperate—he throws himself on the power of God. The word (<span class="lang el-gr">ποτήριον</span>) <em>cup </em>or <em>chalice </em>— as we have mentioned elsewhere — denotes the providence of God, which assigns to each his measure of the cross and of affliction, just as the master of a house gives an allowance to each servant, and distributes portions among the children. </p><p><em>But yet not as I will, but as thou wilt. </em>We see how Christ restrains his feelings at the very outset, and quickly brings himself into a state of obedience. But here it may first be inquired, How was his will pure from all vice, while it did not agree with the will of God? For if the will of God is the only rule of what is good and right, it follows, that all the feelings which are at variance with it are vicious. I reply: Though it be true rectitude to regulate all our feelings by the good pleasure of God, yet there is a certain kind of indirect disagreement with it which is not faulty, and is not reckoned as sin; if, for <em>example, </em>a person desire to see the Church in a calm and flourishing condition, if he wish that the children of God were delivered from afflictions, that all superstitions were removed out of the world, and that the rage of wicked men were so restrained as to do no injury. These things, being in themselves right, may properly be desired by believers, though it may please God to order a different state of matters: for he chooses that his Son should reign among enemies; that his people should be trained under the cross; and that the triumph of faith and of the Gospel should be rendered more illustrious by the opposing machinations of Satan. We see how those prayers are holy, which appear to be contrary to the will of God; for God does not desire us to be always exact or scrupulous in inquiring what he has appointed, but allows us to ask what is desirable according to the capacity of our senses. </p><p>But the question has not yet been fully answered: for since we have just now said that all the feelings of Christ were properly regulated, how does he now correct himself? For he brings his feelings into obedience to God in such a manner as if he had exceeded what was proper. Certainly in the first prayer we do not perceive that calm moderation which I have described; for, as far as lies in his power, he refuses and shrinks from discharging the office of Mediator. I reply: When the dread of death was presented to his mind, and brought along with it such darkness, that he left out of view every thing else, and eagerly presented that prayer, there was no fault in this. Nor is it necessary to enter into any subtle controversy whether or not it was possible for him to forget our salvation. We ought to be satisfied with this single consideration, that at the time when he uttered a prayer to be delivered from death, he was not thinking of other things which would have shut the door against such a wish. </p><p>If it be objected, that the first movement, which needed to be restrained before it proceeded farther, was not so well regulated as it ought to have been, I reply: In the present corruption of our nature it is impossible to find ardor of affections accompanied by moderation, such as existed in Christ; but we ought to give such honor to the Son of God, as not to judge of him by what we find in ourselves. For in us all the affections of the flesh, when strongly excited, break out into rebellion, or, at least, have some mixture of pollution; but Christ, amidst the utmost vehemence of grief or fear, restrained himself within proper bounds. Nay more, as musical sounds, though various and differing from each other, are so far from being discordant, that they produce sweet melody and fine harmony; so in Christ there was a remarkable example of adaptation between the two wills, <span class="cite-ref">(203)</span> the will of God and the will of man, so that they differed from each other without any conflict or opposition. </p><p>This passage shows plainly enough the gross folly of those ancient heretics, who were called <em>Monothelites, </em><span class="cite-ref">(204)</span> because they imagined that the will of Christ was but one and simple; for Christ, as he was God, <em>willed </em>nothing different from the Father; and therefore it follows, that his human soul had affections distinct from the secret purpose of God. But if even Christ was under the necessity of holding his will captive, in order to subject it to the government of God, though it was properly regulated, how carefully ought we to repress the violence of our feelings, which are always inconsiderate, and rash, and full of rebellion? And though the Spirit of God governs us, so that we wish nothing but what is agreeable to reason, still we owe to God such obedience as to endure patiently that our wishes should not be granted; <span class="cite-ref">(205)</span> For the modesty of faith consists in permitting God to appoint differently from what we desire. Above all, when we have no certain and special promise, we ought to abide by this rule, not to ask any thing but on the condition that God shall fulfill what he has decreed; which cannot be done, unless we give up our wishes to his disposal. </p><p>It comes now to be inquired, what advantage did Christ gain by praying? The apostle, in writing to the Hebrews, says that <em>he was heard </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">ἀπὸ τὢς εὐλαβείας</span><em>) on account of his fear: </em>for so ought that passage to be explained, and not, as it is usually explained, <em>on account of his reverence, </em>(<span class="bvs">Heb_5:7</span>.) That would not have been consistent, if Christ had simply feared death; for he was not delivered from it. Hence it follows, that what led him to pray to be delivered from death was the dread of a greater evil. When he saw the wrath of God exhibited to him, as he stood at the tribunal of God charged with the sins of the whole world, he unavoidably shrunk with horror from the deep abyss of death. And, therefore, though he suffered death, yet since <em>its pains were loosed </em>—<em>as </em>Peter tells us, (<span class="bvs">Act_2:24</span>,)—and he was victorious in the conflict, the Apostle justly says, that he was heard <em>on account of his fear. </em>Here ignorant people rise up and exclaim, that it would have been unworthy of Christ to be afraid of being swallowed up by death. But I should wish them to answer this question, What kind <em>of fear </em>do they suppose it to have been which drew from Christ <em>drops of blood? </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_22:44</span>) For that mortal sweat could only have proceeded from fearful and unusual horror. If any person, in the present day, were to <em>sweat blood, </em>and in such a quantity that the <em>drops </em>should <em>fall to the ground, </em>it would be reckoned an astonishing miracle; and if this happened to any man through <em>fear of death, </em>we would say that he had a cowardly and effeminate mind. Those men, therefore, who deny that Christ prayed that the Father would rescue him from the gulf of death, ascribe to him a cowardice that would be disgraceful even in an ordinary man. </p><p>If it be objected, that the <em>fear </em>which I am describing arises from unbelief, the answer is easy. When Christ was struck with horror at the divine curse, the feeling of the flesh affected him in such a manner, that faith still remained firm and unshaken. For such was the purity of his nature, that he felt, without being wounded by them, those temptations which pierce us with their stings. And yet those persons, by representing him not to have felt temptations, foolishly imagine that he was victorious without fighting. And, indeed, we have no right to suppose that he used any hypocrisy, when he complained of a mortal sadness in his soul; nor do the Evangelists speak falsely, when they say that he <em>was exceedingly sorrowful, </em>and that he <em>trembled </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(201)</span> “<em class="lang fr-fr">A desiré d’estre separé de Christ </em><em>;” </em>— <em>“desired to be separated from Christ.” </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(202)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Avec ceste condition de souffrir la mort</span>;” — “on this condition of suffering death.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(203)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les deux volontés</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(204)</span><span class="lang el-gr">Μονοθελὢται </span> is compounded of <span class="lang el-gr">μόνος</span>, <em>one, </em>and <span class="lang el-gr">θέλω</span>, <em>I will. </em>The <em>Monothelite </em>heresy sprung up in the Seventh Century, and is fully detailed by our ecclesiastical historians. Its leading tenet was, that Christ had not <em>one will </em>as God, and <em>another will </em>as Man. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(205)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que nos souhaits ne vienent point à loeur issue, quand ainsi luy plaist</span>;” — “that our wishes should not succeed, when it so pleases Him.” </p></div></div>
