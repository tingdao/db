<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Let thy priests, </em>etc. He now prays in general for the prosperity of the Church, as what stood intimately connected with the previous statement, the promotion of our best interests being the great end for which God dwells amongst us. Some construe the words into a wish that the worship of God might be maintained in its purity, and think that the Psalmist prays that the priests might be clothed with holiness in allusion to their sacred garments. Upon a closer view of the words and the whole context, I am rather inclined to be of another opinion, and to consider this a prayer that the righteousness of God might be displayed amongst the people, being as an ornament upon the priests, and communicating joy to all the people. Thus I take <em>righteousness </em>to mean the fruit or effects of righteousness, and this the righteousness of God, not of men. The <em>priests </em>are of course mentioned first, as holding a higher place in the appointed order of the Church; while they have their due place assigned to them, it is still the Church collectively to which the prayer refers as though the Psalmist requested that the glory of this righteousness should be reflected from the priests upon the people generally. God is said to clothe us with his righteousness when he appears as our Savior and help, defends us by his power, and shows in his government of us that we are the objects of his care. The <em>rejoicing </em>which is spoken of must have reference to a life of happiness. And these two things being joined together may convince us that by <em>righteousness </em>nothing else is meant than God’s guardianship and government. Consistently with this we find it said afterwards ­ “Thy priests shall be clothed with salvation;” and I may add, that Solomon, in the solemn prayer already referred to, (<span class="bvs">2Ch_6:41</span>,) makes no mention of righteousness, but of salvation. I have repeatedly given the reason why the saints of God are called <span class="lang he-il">חסידים</span><em>chasidim, </em>or <em>merciful ones, </em>because mercy or beneficence is that grace which assimilates us most to God. </p></div>
