<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>But if what I desire not, I do, I consent to the law, etc.</em>; that is, “When my heart acquiesces in the law, and is delighted with its righteousness, (which certainly is the case when it hates the transgression of it,) it then perceives and acknowledges the goodness of the law, so that we are fully convinced, experience itself being our teacher, that no evil ought to be imputed to the law; nay, that it would be salutary to men, were it to meet with upright and pure hearts.” But this consent is not to be understood to be the same with what we have heard exists in the ungodly, who have expressed words of this kind, “I see better things and approve of them; I follow the worse.” Again, “What is hurtful I follow; I shun what I believe would be profitable.” For these act under a constraint when they subscribe to the righteousness of God, as their will is wholly alienated from it, but the godly man consents to the law with the real and most cheerful desire of his heart; for he wishes nothing more than to mount up to heaven. <span class="cite-ref">(224)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(224)</span> “I consent — <em>consentio </em><span class="lang el-gr">— συμφημι, </span> I say with, assent to, agree with, confirm.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
