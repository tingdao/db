<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>41.</strong><em>Watch and pray. </em>As the disciples were unmoved by their Master’s danger, their attention is directed to themselves, that a conviction of their own danger may arouse them. Christ therefore threatens that, if they do not <em>watch and pray, </em>they may be soon overwhelmed by <em>temptation. </em>As if he had said, “Though you take no concern about me, do not fail, at least, to think of yourselves; for your own interests are involved in it, and if you do not take care, <em>temptation </em>will immediately swallow you up.” For <em>to enter into temptation </em>means <em>to yield to it. </em><span class="cite-ref">(206)</span> And let us observe, that the manner of resistance which is here enjoined is, not to draw courage from reliance on our own strength and perseverance, but, on the contrary, from a conviction of our weakness, to ask arms and strength from the Lord. Our <em>watching, </em>therefore, will be of no avail without <em>prayer. </em></p><p><em>The spirit indeed is willing. </em>That he may not terrify and discourage his disciples, he gently reproves their slothfulness, and adds consolation and good ground of hope. And, first, he reminds them, that though they are earnestly desirous to do what is right, still they must contend with the weakness of the flesh, and, therefore, that prayer is never unnecessary. We see, then, that he gives them the praise of <em>willingness, </em>in order that their weakness may not throw them into despair, and yet urges them to <em>prayer, </em>because they are not sufficiently endued with the power of the Spirit. Wherefore, this admonition relates properly to believers, who, being regenerated by the Spirit of God, are desirous to do what is right, but still labor under the <em>weakness </em>of the <em>flesh; </em>for though the grace of <em>the Spirit </em>is vigorous in them, they are <em>weak </em>according to <em>the flesh. </em>And though the disciples alone have their weakness here pointed out to them, yet, since what Christ says of them applies equally to all, we ought to draw from it a general rule, that it is our duty to keep diligent <em>watch </em>by <em>praying; </em>for we do not yet possess the power of <em>the Spirit </em>in such a measure as not to fall frequently through the <em>weakness </em>of <em>the flesh, </em>unless the Lord grant his assistance to raise up and uphold us. But there is no reason why we should tremble with excessive anxiety; for an undoubted remedy is held out to us, which we will neither have nor to seek nor to seek in vain; for Christ promises that all who, being earnest in <em>prayer, </em>shall perseveringly oppose the slothfulness of the flesh, will be victorious. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(206)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Succomber et estre viencu</span>;” — “to yield and to be overcome.” </p></div></div>
