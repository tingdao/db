<div class="comment-content"><p>It now <em>follows, </em>— <em>While the speech was in the mouth of the king, a voice descended from heaven </em>—<em>They say unto thee, O King Nebuchadnezzar, thy kingdom has departed from thee! </em>God does not now admonish the king of Babylon by either the mouth of a Prophet or a dream by night; but he sends forth his own voice from heaven; and as if he had not tamed down the pride by which the king was puffed up, a voice is now heard from heaven which inspires greater terror than either the Prophet’s <em>oracle </em>or interpretation. Thus God is in the habit of dealing with the hardened and impenitent, since he causes his own prophets to denounce the penalty which hangs over them. Besides, when he sees them untouched or unaffected, he doubles the terror, until the final execution follows, as in. the case of this tyrant. <em>The word was in the king’s mouth when, the voice was heard. </em>We see how God restrains in a moment the madness of those who raise themselves <em>extravagantly. </em>But it is not surprising that the voice was so suddenly heard, because time for repentance was allowed to King Nebuchadnezzar. In the form of speech, <em>they say to thee, </em>it is not necessary to inquire anxiously to whom these words apply. Some restrict them to angels; but I do not agree to this; it seems rather to be used in the customary <em>way, they say </em>— <em>meaning </em>“it is said,” as if sanctioned by common consent. Hence <em>they say to thee, O King Nebuchadnezzar; </em>God does not simply call him by his name, but uses the word king — not for the sake of honor, but of ridicule, and to strike away from the king all the allurements by which he deceived himself. Thou indeed art intoxicated by thy present splendor, for while all adore thee, thou art forgetful of thy frailty; but this royal majesty and power will not hinder God from laying thee prostrate; for since thou: wilt not humble thyself, thy kingdom shall be taken from thee! This indeed appeared incredible, since Nebuchadnezzar had the tranquil possession of the kingdom in his hand; no one dared to shew himself his enemy; he had subdued all his neighbors; his monarchy was terrible to all nations; hence God pronounces, <em>The kingdom has gassed away from thee! </em>And this shews the certainty of the oracle; and thus Nebuchadnezzar may know the time to be fulfilled, and the punishment to be no longer delayed, because he had trifled with God’s indulgence. </p></div>
