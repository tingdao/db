<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Of which I was made a minister. </em>Having declared the gospel to be the instrument employed in communicating grace to the Gentiles, he now adds, that he <em>was made a minister </em>of the Gospel; and thus applies to himself the general statements which had been made. But, to avoid claiming for himself more than is proper, he affirms that it is<em>the gift of the grace of God, </em>and that this gift was an exhibition of divine <em>power. </em>As if he had said, “Inquire not what I have deserved; for in the free exercise of kindness, the Lord made me an apostle of the Gentiles, not for any excellence of mine, but by his own grace. Inquire not what I formerly was; for it is the Lord’s prerogative to ‘exalt them of low degree.’” (<span class="bvs">Luk_1:52</span>.) To produce something great out of nothing, shews <em>the effectual working of his power. </em></p></div>
