<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>As I ought</em>. This clause sets forth more strongly the difficulty, for he intimates that it is no ordinary matter. In the Epistle to the Ephesians, (<span class="bvs">Eph_6:20</span>,) he adds, <span class="lang el-gr">ἵνα παῤῥησιάσωμαι</span>, (<em>that I may speak boldly</em>,) from which it appears that he desired for himself an undaunted confidence, such as befits the majesty of the gospel. Farther, as Paul here does nothing else than desire that grace may be given him for the discharge of his office, let us bear in mind that a rule is in like manner prescribed to us, not to give way to the fury of our adversaries, but to strive even to death in the publication of the gospel. As this, however, is beyond our power, it is necessary that we should <em>continue in prayer</em>, that the Lord may not leave us destitute of the spirit of confidence. </p></div>
