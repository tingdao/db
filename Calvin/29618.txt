<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>For this we say unto you</em>. He now briefly explains the manner in which believers will be raised up from death. Now, as he speaks of a thing that is very great, and is incredible to the human mind, and also promises what is above the power and choice of men, he premises that he does not bring forward anything that is his own, or that proceeds from men, but that the Lord is the Author of it. It is probable, however, that the <em>word of the Lord </em>means what was taken from his discourses. <span class="cite-ref">(579)</span> For though Paul had learned by revelation all the secrets of the heavenly kingdom, it was, nevertheless, more fitted to establish in the minds of believers the belief of a resurrection, when he related those things that had been uttered by Christ’s own mouth. “We are not the first witnesses of the resurrection, but instead of this the Master himself declared it.” <span class="cite-ref">(580)</span></p><p><em>We who live. </em>This has been said by him with this view — that they might not think that those only would be partakers of the resurrection who would be alive at the time of Christ’s coming, and that those would have no part in it who had been previously taken away by death. “The order of the resurrection,” says he, “will begin with them: <span class="cite-ref">(581)</span> we shall accordingly not rise without them.” From this it appears that the belief of a final resurrection had been, in the minds of some, slight and obscure, and involved in various errors, inasmuch as they imagined that the dead would be deprived of it; for they imagined that eternal life belonged to those alone whom Christ, at his last coming, would find still alive upon the earth. Paul, with the view of remedying these errors, assigns the first place to the dead, and afterwards teaches that those will follow who will be at that time remaining in this life. </p><p>As to the circumstance, however, that by speaking in the first person he makes himself, as it were, one of the number of those who will live until the last day, he means by this to arouse the Thessalonians to wait for it, nay more, to hold all believers in suspense, that they may not promise themselves some particular time: for, granting that it was by a special revelation that he knew that Christ would come at a somewhat later time, <span class="cite-ref">(582)</span> it was nevertheless necessary that this doctrine should be delivered to the Church in common, that believers might be prepared at all times. In the mean time, it was necessary thus to cut off all pretext for the curiosity of many — as we shall find him doing afterwards at greater length. When, however, he says, <em>we that are alive</em>, he makes use of the present tense instead of the future, in accordance with the Hebrew idiom. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(579)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Prins des sermons de Christ</span>;” — “Taken from the sermons of Christ.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(580)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">L’a affermee et testifiee assureement par ses propos</span>;” — “Has affirmed and testified it with certainty in his discourses.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(581)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Commencera par ceux qui seront decedez auparauant</span>;” — “Will commence with those who shall have previously departed.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(582)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne viendroit si tost</span>;” — “Would not come so soon.” </p></div></div>
