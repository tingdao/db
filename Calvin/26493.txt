<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>But the hireling. </em>By <em>hirelings </em>we are to understand those who retain the pure doctrine, and who proclaim the truth, as Paul says, to serve a purpose rather than from pure zeal. Though such persons do not serve Christ faithfully, yet we ought to hear them; for Christ wished that <em>the Pharisees </em>should be heard, <em>because they sat in Moses </em>’<em>seat</em>, (<span class="bvs">Mat_23:2</span>;) and, in like manner, we ought to give such honor to the Gospel, as not to shrink from its ministers, though they be not good men. And as even the slightest offenses render the Gospel distasteful to us, that we may not be hindered by such false delicacy, let us always remember what I have formerly suggested, that if the Spirit of Christ does not operate so powerfully in ministers, as to make it plainly evident that he is their <em>shepherd</em>, we suffer the punishment of our sins, and yet our obedience is proved. </p><p><em>And he who is not the shepherd. </em>Though Christ claims for himself alone the name of a <em>shepherd, </em>yet he indirectly states that, in some respects, he holds it in common with the agents by whom he acts. For we know that there have been many, since the time of Christ, who did not hesitate to shed their blood for the salvation of the Church; and even the prophets, before his coming, did not spare their own life. But in his own person he holds out a perfect example, so as to lay down a rule for his ministers. For how base and shameful is our indolence, if our life is more dear to us than the salvation of the Church, which Christ preferred to his own life! </p><p>What is here said about <em>laying down life for the sheep</em>, may be viewed as an undoubted and principal mark of paternal affection. Christ intended, first, to demonstrate what a remarkable proof he gave of his love toward us, and, next, to excite all his ministers to imitate his example. Yet we must attend to the difference between them and him. He <em>laid down his life </em>as the price of satisfaction, shed his blood to cleanse our souls, offered his body as a propitiatory sacrifice, to reconcile the Father to us. Nothing of all this can exist in the ministers of the Gospel, all of whom need to be cleansed, and receive atonement and reconciliation to God by that single sacrifice. But Christ does not argue here about the efficacy or benefit of his death, so as to compare himself to others, but to prove with what zeal and affection <span class="cite-ref">(288)</span> he is moved towards us, and, next, to invite others to follow his example. In short, as it belongs exclusively to Christ to procure life for us by his death, and to fulfill all that is contained in the Gospel, so it is the universal duty of all <em>pastors </em>or <em>shepherds</em>, to defend the doctrine which they proclaim, even at the expense of their life, and to seal the doctrine of the Gospel with their blood, and to show that it is not in vain that they teach that Christ has procured salvation for themselves and for others. </p><p>But here a question may be put. Ought we to reckon that man <em>a hireling, </em>who, for any reason whatever, shrinks from encountering the wolves? This was anciently debated as a practical question, when tyrants raged cruelly against the Church. Tertullian, and others of the same class, were, in my opinion, too rigid on this point. I prefer greatly the moderation of Augustine, who allows pastors to flee on the condition that, by their flight, they contribute more to the public safety than they would do by betraying the flock committed to their charge. And he shows that this is done, when the Church is not deprived of well-qualified ministers, and when the life of the pastor in particular is so eagerly sought, that his absence mitigates the rage of enemies. But it the flock — as well as the pastor — be in danger, <span class="cite-ref">(289)</span> and if there be reason to believe that the pastor flees, not so much from a desire to promote the public advantage as from a dread of dying, Augustine contends that this is not at all lawful, because the example of his flight will do more injury than his life can do good in future. The reader may consult the Epistle to Bishop Honoratus, (<strong>Ep. 108</strong>) On this ground it was lawful for Cyprian to flee, who was so far from shuddering at death, that he nobly refused to accept the offer of saving his life by a treacherous denial of his Master. Only it must be held that a pastor ought to prefer his flock, or even a single sheep, to his own life. </p><p><em>Whose own the sheep are not. </em>Christ appears here to make all <em>shepherds </em>besides himself to be, without exception,<em>hirelings</em>; for, since he alone is <em>shepherd</em>, none of us have a right to say that the sheep which he feeds are <em>his own </em>But let us remember that they who are guided by the Spirit of God reckon that to be <em>their own </em>which belongs to their Head; and that not in order to claim power for themselves, but to keep faithfully what has been committed to their charge. For he who is truly united to Christ will never cease to take an interest in that which He valued so highly. This is what he afterwards says: </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(288)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De quel zele et affection</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(289)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que s’il y a danger aussi bien pour les brebis que pour la personne du pasteur</span>.” </p></div></div>
