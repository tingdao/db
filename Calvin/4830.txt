Not that this had been revealed from the beginning, but because God in His indulgence had complied with their request, whereby they enlarged the boundaries of the land. And assuredly it would have been absurd that no place should be given them among their brethren in the promised land, as if they were cast off from the family of Abraham. We have lately seen that this part, which seemed to be separated from the others, was included in the limits laid down by God. Moses, therefore, merely wished to declare that what remained was to be divided by lot. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(229)</span> “La donation qui avoit este desia faite de la region de Basan;” the grant which had been already made of the district of Bashan. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
