<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22</strong><em>And unless those days had been shortened. </em>He presents an appalling view of those calamities, but at the same time mingles it with this consolation, that they would be sufficient to exterminate the very name of the Jews, if God did not look to <em>his elect, </em>and on their account grant some alleviation. This passage agrees with that of Isaiah: </p><p>Unless the Lord had left us a small seed, we would have been as Sodom, and we would have been like Gomorrah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_1:9</span>.) </p><p>For it was necessary, as Paul assures us, that the vengeance of God, which had been displayed in the Babylonish captivity, should be again fulfilled at the coming of Christ, (<span class="bvs">Rom_9:29</span>.) Nay more, in proportion as our wickedness was greater, it deserved a greater severity of punishment. And therefore Christ says that, unless God put a period to those calamities, the Jews will utterly perish, so that not a single individual will be left; but that God will remember his gracious covenant, and will spare <em>his elect, </em>according to that other prediction of Isaiah, </p><p>Though thy people were like the sand of the sea,<LineBreak />a remnant only shall be saved, (<span class="bvs">Isa_10:22</span>.) </p><p>This affords us a striking proof of the judgment of God, when he afflicts his visible Church to such a degree, that we would be ready to conclude that it had altogether perished; and yet, in order to <em>preserve some seed, </em>he miraculously rescues from destruction <em>his </em>elect, though few in number, that, contrary to expectation, they may escape from the jaws of death. For, on the one hand, it is fitted to alarm hypocrites, that they may not, through reliance on the title and outward appearance of a Church, cherish the vain hope that they will pass unpunished, for the Lord will find some means of delivering his Church, when those men have been given up to destruction; and, on the other hand, it conveys a wonderful consolation to the godly, that God will never allow his wrath to proceed so far as not to provide for their safety. Thus, in punishing the Jews, the wrath of God burned to an extent which was truly awful, and yet, contrary to the expectation of men, he restrained it in such a manner, that not one of <em>the elect </em>perished. And it was a miracle which almost exceeded belief; that, as salvation was to proceed from Judea, out of a few drops of a fountain which was dried up God formed rivers to water the whole world; for, in consequence of the hatred of all nations which they had drawn upon themselves, they narrowly escaped from being murdered in all places, by a preconcerted signal, in one day. Nor can it be doubted, that when many persons entreated that they should be slaughtered in this manner, Titus was restrained by God from giving permission to his soldiers and to others who were excessively desirous to carry such a design into execution; and, therefore, when the Roman Emperor at that time prevented the utter destruction of the whole nation, that was the <em>shortening </em>here mentioned, for <em>preserving some seed, </em>(<span class="bvs">Isa_1:9</span>.) </p><p>Yet it ought to be observed, that it was <em>on account of the elect </em>that God restrained the fierceness of his anger, that he might not consume them all. For why did he determine that a few should remain out of a vast multitude? and what reason had he for giving them a preference above others? It was because his grace dwelt in the people whom he had adopted; and, that his covenant might not fail, some were <em>elected </em>and appointed to salvation by his eternal purpose. Hence Paul ascribes to free <em>election </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_11:5</span>) the reason why out of an immense nation <em>a remnant </em>only was saved. Away then with human merits, when our attention is directed exclusively to the good pleasure of God, that the distinction between some persons and others may depend solely on this, that those who have been <em>elected </em>must be saved. To state the matter more clearly and fully, Mark uses a superfluity of words, <span class="cite-ref">(148)</span> expressing it thus, on <em>account of the elect, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days. </em>Certainly the use of the word <em>elect </em>might have been sufficient, if he had not intended to state expressly that God is not induced by external causes to bestow his favor on some rather than on others; but that, because he has <em>elected </em>those whom he will save, he ratifies the secret purpose of his grace in their salvation. </p><p>But a question arises, how was it on <em>account of the elect </em>that God set a limit to these calamities, so as not utterly to destroy the Jews, when many of those who were saved were reprobate and desperate? The reply is easy. A part of the nation was preserved, that out of them God might bring his <em>elect, </em>who were mixed with them, like the seed after the chaff has been blown off. So then, though temporal safety was bestowed equally on the reprobate and on <em>the elect, </em>yet, as it was of no advantage to the reprobate, it is justly ascribed to <em>the elect </em>alone, for it was to their benefit that the wonderful providence of God was directed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(148)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il use de redite, ou de paroles superflues</span>;” — “he makes use of a repetition, or of superfluous words.” </p></div></div>
