<div class="comment-content"><p>This verse confirms what I have said, that the same truth is here repeated by the Prophet, that God’s mercies were not consumed, nor had his compassion’s failed. How so? Because they were new, or renewed, every day; but he puts <em>morning</em>, and that in the plural number. I am surprised at the hour striking so soon; I hardly think that I have lectured a whole hour. </p></div>
