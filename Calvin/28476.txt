<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Know ye not</em>, etc. By <em>unrighteousness </em>here you may understand what is opposed to strict integrity. The<em>unrighteous</em>, then, that is, those who inflict injury on their brethren, who defraud or circumvent others, who, in short, are intent upon their own advantage at the expense of injuring others, <em>will not inherit the kingdom of God </em>That by the <em>unrighteous </em>here, as for example <em>adulterers</em>, and <em>thieves </em>and <em>covetous</em>, and <em>revilers</em>, he means those who do not repent of their sins, but obstinately persist in them, is too manifest to require that it should be stated. The Apostle himself, too, afterwards expresses this in the words employed by him, when he says that the Corinthians formerly <em>were such </em>The wicked, then, <em>do inherit the kingdom of God</em>, but it is only in the event of their having been first converted to the Lord in true repentance, and having in this way ceased to be wicked. For although conversion is not the ground of pardon, yet we know that none are reconciled to God but those who repent. The interrogation, however, is emphatic, for it intimates that he states nothing but what they themselves know, and is matter of common remark among all pious persons. </p><p><em>Be not deceived </em>He takes occasion from one vice to speak of many. I am of opinion, however, that he has pointed out those vices chiefly which prevailed among the Corinthians. He makes use of three terms for reproving those lascivious passions which, as all historical accounts testify, reigned, nay raged, to an extraordinary height in that city. For it was a city that abounded in wealth, (as has been stated elsewhere.) It was a celebrated mart, which was frequented by merchants from many nations. Wealth has luxury as its attendant — the mother of unchastity and all kinds of lasciviousness. In addition to this, a nation which was of itself prone to wantonness, was prompted to it by many other corruptions. </p><p>The difference between <em>fornicators </em>and <em>adulterers </em>is sufficiently well known. By <em>effeminate </em>persons I understand those who, although they do not openly abandon themselves to impurity, discover, nevertheless, their unchastity by blandishments of speech, by lightness of gesture and apparel, and other allurements. The fourth description of crime is the most abominable of all — that monstrous pollution which was but too prevalent in Greece. </p><p>He employs three terms in reproving injustice and injuries. He gives the name of <em>thieves </em>to those who take the advantage of their brethren by any kind of fraud or secret artifice. By<em>extortioners</em>, he means those that violently seize on another’s wealth, or like harpies <span class="cite-ref">(340)</span> drew to themselves from every quarter, and devour. With the view of giving his discourse a wider range, he afterwards adds all <em>covetous </em>persons too. Under the term <em>drunkards </em>you are to understand him as including those who go to excess in eating. He more particularly reproves <em>revilers</em>, because, in all probability, that city was full of gossip and slanders. In short, he makes mention chiefly of those vices to which, he saw, that city was addicted. </p><p>Farther, that his threatening may have more weight, he says, <em>be not deceived</em>; by which expression he admonishes them not to flatter themselves with a vain hope, as persons are accustomed, by extenuating their offenses, to inure themselves to contempt of God. No poison, therefore, is more dangerous than those allurements which encourage us in our sins. Let us, therefore, shun, not as the songs of the Sirens, <span class="cite-ref">(341)</span> but as the deadly bites of Satan, the talk of profane persons, when turning the judgment of God and reproofs of sins into matter of jest. Lastly, we must also notice here the propriety of the word <span class="lang el-gr">κληρονομειν</span> —<em>to inherit</em>; which shows <em>that the kingdom of heaven </em>is the <em>inheritance of sons</em>, and therefore comes to us through the privilege of adoption. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(340)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme bestes rauissantes</span>;” — “Like ravenous beasts.” The harpies, it is well known, were fabulous monsters, proverbial for rapacity. It deserves to be noticed that their name <span class="lang el-gr">ἅρπυίαι</span>, and the term made use of by Paul to denote <em>extortioners</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἅρπαγες</span>) are both of them derived from <span class="lang el-gr">ἅρπάζω</span>, to seize upon, or take by violence. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(341)</span> The Sirens were a kind of marine monsters, which were supposed to inhabit certain rocky islands on the south-west coast of Italy, and decoyed, it was alleged, by their enchanting music, mariners to their destruction. Homer in his Odyssey (8. 45) speaks of their <em>melodious song </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">λιγυρὢ ἀοιδὢ.</span>) Our Author, it will be observed, in the connection in which he alludes to “the songs of the Sirens,” strongly expresses his belief of the <em>reality </em>of Satanic influence, as contrasted with what is <em>merely fabulous</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
