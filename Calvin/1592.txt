<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And he said, Certainly I will be with thee. </em>It is remarkable that God sets his ready help alone against all to overcome every fear, and to take away every scruple; as much as to say, It matters not who Moses is, or what may be his strength, so that God be his leader. In these words we are taught, that he is never regarded by us with due honor, unless when, contented with his assistance alone, we seek for no ground of confidence apart from him; and, although our own weakness may alarm us, think it enough that he is on our side. Hence these celebrated confessions of his saints: </p><p>“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_23:4</span>.) </p><p>Again, </p><p>“In God have I put my trust;<LineBreak />I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_56:4</span>.) </p><p>Again, </p><p>“I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_3:6</span>.) </p><p>Again, </p><p>“If God be for us, who can be against us?” (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:31</span>.) </p><p>Therefore, in proportion to our advancement in the faith, when we are exposed to the greatest dangers, do we magnify the power of God, and, exalting ourselves in that, advance boldly against all the world; and this is the ground of firm and unwearied obedience, when the thought that God is with us is deeply rooted in our hearts. But, after Moses is commanded to turn away his reflections from himself, and to fix all his regards upon the promised help of God, he is confirmed by a sign, that the Israelites should sacrifice on Mount Horeb three days after their departure from Egypt. Still this promise appears neither very apt nor opportune, since it would not exist in effect till the thing was done. I pass over the forced interpretations, which some, to avoid this absurdity, have adduced; since others wisely and prudently observe, that the confirmation which we receive from posterior tokens, is neither useless nor vain, and that there are examples of it elsewhere in Scripture. Samuel, by anointing David, promises that he shall be king of the people; and pronounces that this shall be the sign that the anointing is from God. (<span class="bvs">1Sa_16:13</span>.) David had long to battle with misfortunes before he could enjoy this token, yet will it not be thought superfluous, since in its season it confirmed the favor of God. Isaiah, prophesying of the raising of the siege of the city, adds a sign, </p><p>“Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_37:30</span>.) </p><p>It was said to John the Baptist, </p><p>“Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_1:33</span>.) </p><p>Yet, before he beheld that sign, he already knew that Christ was the Son of God; for the prophecies of both his parents were well known to him. But there is nothing absurd in the faith, which is founded on the word, being increased by the addition of a sign. In fine, God magnifies his mercy by the new mercy which supervenes, thus, as it were, heaping up the measure; and, in truth, the vocation of Moses was ratified by a remarkable proof, when, in the very place on which he then stood, the people, brought forth by his instrumentality, offered a solemn sacrifice. In the meantime God kept his servant in suspense, as though he had said, Let me perform what I have decreed; in due time you will know that your were not sent by me in vain, when you have brought the people safely to this spot. </p></div>
