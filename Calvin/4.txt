<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>And God saw the light </em>Here God is introduced by Moses as surveying his work, that he might take pleasure in it. But he does it for our sake, to teach us that God has made nothing without a certain reason and design. And we ought not so to understand the words of Moses as if God did not know that his work was good, till it was finished. But the meaning of the passage is, that the work, such as we now see it, was approved by God. Therefore nothing remains for us, but to acquiesce in this judgment of God. And this admonition is very useful. For whereas man ought to apply all his senses to the admiring contemplation of the works of God, <span class="cite-ref">(56)</span> we see what license he really allows himself in detracting from them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(56)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">L’homme devroit estendere tous ses sens a considerer, et avoir en admiration les oeuvres de Dieu</span>.” — “Man ought to apply all his senses in considering and having in admiration the works of God.” — French Tr. </p></div></div>
