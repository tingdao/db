<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>For the violent man is brought to nought. </em>He states more clearly what we have already mentioned in the former verse, namely, that the restoration of the Church consists in this, that the Lord raises up those who are cast down, and has compassion on the poor. But that purification of the Church, of which we have already spoken, is first necessary; for so long as the Lord does not execute his judgment against the wicked, and the bad are mixed with the good, so as even to hold the highest place in the Church, everything is soiled and corrupted, God is not worshipped or feared, and even godliness is trampled under feet. When therefore the ungodly are removed or subdued, the Church is restored to its splendour, and the godly, freed from distresses and calamities, leap for joy. </p><p>First, he calls them <span class="lang he-il">עריצים</span>, (<em>gnărītzīm</em>,) “violent.” There are various interpretations of this word; but I think that the Prophet distinguishes between those who are openly wicked, and have no shame, <span class="cite-ref">(279)</span> and those who have some appearance of goodness, and yet are not better than others, for they mock at God in their hearts. But perhaps by the two adjectives, “violent” and “scorners,” he describes the same persons; because, like robbers among men, they seize, oppress, treat with cruelty, and commit every kind of outrage, and yet are not withheld by any fear of God, because they regard religion as a fable. </p><p><em>And they who hastened early to iniquity. </em><span class="cite-ref">(280)</span> Under this class he includes other crimes. He speaks not of the Chaldeans or Assyrians, but of those who wished to be reckoned in the number of the godly, and boasted of being the seed of Abraham. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(279)</span> Bogus footnote </p><p><span class="cite-note">(280)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
