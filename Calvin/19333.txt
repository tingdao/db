<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet more fully declares, that he was hated by the whole people because he pleased God. He indeed inveighs against the impiety of those who then bore rule; he does not here so much reprove the common people as the chief men, who exercised authority and administered justice; for when he speaks of the assembly of the ungodly, he no doubt refers to wicked rulers, as the word <span class="lang he-il">סוד</span>, <em>sud, </em>which means a secret, means also a council. And David (or whosoever was the author of the sixty-ninth Psalm) says, not that he was a sport to the vulgar, but that he was derided by those who sat in the gate, (<span class="bvs">Psa_69:12</span>) which means, that he was reproachfully treated by wicked judges, who possessed the chief authority. So also in this place, Jeremiah says, that he did <em>not sit in the council of mockers </em>It is not the same word as in the first Psalm; and <span class="lang he-il">סוד</span>, <em>sud, </em>is sometimes taken in a good sense, but here in a bad sense; for Jeremiah speaks of the profane despisers of God, who ridiculed everything that was announced in the name of God. <span class="cite-ref">(148)</span></p><p>Now it was necessary for the holy man thus to exasperate these impious men, for they were in favor, credit, and authority with the people; and we know that they who were in power do in a manner dazzle the eyes of the vulgar with their splendor. As they then thus deceived the simple, the Prophet removed the mask, and exclaimed, that he did not sit in their council nor exulted with them. In denying that he was connected with them, he intimates what their conduct and manners were. He therefore shews, that whatever their dignity might be, they were still the impious despisers of God, and were only mockers. The same is the case with us at this day, we are under the necessity directly to expose those masked rulers, who are inflated with their own power and fascinate the people; for buffoons in tippling-houses and taverns do not so wantonly mock God as those courtiers, who, while consulting respecting the state of the whole earth, and deciding on the affairs of all kingdoms, seem as though they themselves possessed all the power of God; and we also know that they are profane mockers. Hardly any piety or reverence for God is to be found in the courts of princes; nay, especially at their councils, the devil reigns, as it were, without control. We are therefore constrained often to speak very strongly against such unprincipled men, who falsely assume the name of God, and by this pretense deceive the common people. By this necessity was Jeremiah constrained to declare, that he had not been in the assembly of such men. </p><p>He then adds, <em>On account of thine hand </em>(from the presence of thine hand) <em>I sat apart, because with indignation hast thou filled me </em>Here Jeremiah confesses that he had departed from the people; but he did so, because he could not have otherwise obeyed God. Some consider hand to mean prophecy, and others, a stroke; and so it is often taken metaphorically; but I am disposed to take it for command, “On account of thy hand;” that is, because I attended to what thou hast commanded, nor had I any other object but to obey thee. Hence, <em>On account of thine hand, </em>because I regarded thee and wished wholly to submit to thy will, <em>I sat apart </em></p><p>This passage is especially deserving of notice; for the Prophet was at Jerusalem among the priests, and was one of them, as we found at the beginning of this book. Though then he was a priest, he was constrained to separate himself and to renounce all connection with his colleagues and brethren. As then this was the case with the holy Prophet, why do the Papists try to frighten us by objecting to us our separation, as though it were a most heinous crime? they call us apostates, because we have departed from their assemblies; truly if Jeremiah was an apostate, we need not be ashamed to follow his example, since he was approved by God, though he separated from the whole people, and also from the ungodly priests. Let us at this day openly and boldly confess that we have separated. There is then a separation between us, and one indeed irreconcilable; and accursed were we, if we sought an union with the Papists. We are therefore constrained plainly and openly to repudiate them, and to move heaven and earth rather than to agree with them. We see that there is a rule here prescribed to us by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of Jeremiah. To refute then the ealumnies of those who object to us our separation, this very passage is sufficient. </p><p>“I sat apart,” and true it, was so; but no one can say this at this day; for the Lord has gathered to himself many teachers and many disciples. They then who now profess the gospel do not sit apart as Jeremiah. But though all had forsakert him, he yet hesitated not to separate himself from all. But were it necessary for every one of us to become separated and to live apart, were God to scatter each of us through all the regions of the world, so that no one were to strengthen and encourage another, yet we should still stand firm, under the conviction that we sat apart on account of God’s hand. Let the Papists then complain as they please, that we are proud, and that we disturb the peace of the whole world, provided we have this answer to give, — That we sit apart on account of God’s hand, because we seek to obey God and to follow his call: we can therefore boldly and safely despise and scorn all the reproaches with which they falsely load us. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>For thou hast filled me with idignation </em><span class="cite-ref">(149)</span> He confirms what he said in the last verse, — that he had eaten the word of God, that he had not been slightly moved, but had been inflamed with zeal for God: for we cannot really execute the commission given to us unless we be fined with indignation, that is, unless zeal for God burns inwardly, for the prophetic office requires such a fervor. He then adds — </p><p><strong>(148)</strong><em>Gataker</em>, and after him <em>Blayney</em>, consider the word, rendered “mockers” by <em>Calvin </em>and our version, as meaning “those who make merry;” and the word is so rendered in our version in <span class="bvs">Jer_30:19</span>, and <span class="bvs">Jer_31:4</span>. The <em>Septuagint</em>, the <em>Vulgate</em>, and the <em>Targum</em>, favor this rendering; the <em>Syriac </em>and the <em>Arabic</em>, have “mockers.” Then the next line is, — </p><p>Nor did I exult on account of thy hand. </p><p>So all the versions connect the words. The “hand” means, as <em>Blayney </em>says, the impulse of the prophetic spirit. See <span class="bvs">1Kg_18:46</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_1:3</span>. He did not inconsiderately rejoice on account of his office, because he was made a prophet. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(149)</strong> “Because all the prophecies thou hast given me are minatory.” — <em>Grotius</em>. </p><p>The meaning may be, “Thou hast filled me with indignant messages.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
