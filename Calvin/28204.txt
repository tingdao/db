<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>But all have not obeyed the gospel, etc. </em>This belongs not to the argument, which Paul designed to follow in the gradation he lays down; nor does he refer to it in the conclusion which immediately follows. It was yet expedient for Paul to introduce the sentence here, in order to anticipate an objection, lest any one should build an argument on what he had said, — that the word in order always precedes faith, as the seed the corn, — and draw this inference, that faith everywhere follows the word: for Israel, who had never been without the word, might have made a boast of this kind. It was therefore necessary, that, in passing, he should give them this intimation, — that many are called, who are yet not chosen. </p><p>He also quotes a passage from <span class="bvs">Isa_53:1</span>; where the Prophet, before he proceeds to announce a remarkable prediction respecting the death and the kingdom of Christ, speaks with astonishment of the few number of believers, who appeared to him in the Spirit to be so few, that he was constrained to exclaim, “O Lord, who has believed our report?” that is, the word which we preach. For though in Hebrew the term <span class="lang he-il">שמועה</span>,<em>shimuoe, </em>means passively a word, <span class="cite-ref">(333)</span> yet the Greeks have rendered it, <span class="lang el-gr">ἀκοὴν</span> — <em>hearing, </em>and the Latins, <em>auditum </em> — <em>hearing; </em>incorrectly indeed, but with no ambiguity in the meaning. </p><p>We now see why this exception was by the way introduced; it was, that no one might suppose that faith necessarily follows where there is preaching. He however does afterwards point out the reason, by saying, “To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” by which he intimates that there is no benefit from the word, except when God shines in us by the light of his Spirit; and thus the inward calling, which alone is efficacious and peculiar to the elect, is distinguished from the outward voice of men. It is hence evident, how foolishly some maintain, that all are indiscriminately the elect, because the doctrine of salvation is universal, and because God invites all indiscriminately to himself. But the generality of the promises does not alone and by itself make salvation common to all: on the contrary, the peculiar revelation, mentioned by the Prophet, confines it to the elect. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(333)</span> Or, what is heard; it being a noun from <span class="lang he-il">שמע</span>, to hear, in its passive sense, it signifies a report, a message, or any tidings conveyed to the hearing of men. The Greek word<span class="lang el-gr">ἀκοή </span> is used in various senses, as signifying the <em>act </em>of hearing, <span class="bvs">Mat_13:14</span>, — the <em>faculty </em>of hearing, <span class="bvs">1Co_12:17</span>, — the <em>organ </em>of hearing, the ear, <span class="bvs">Mar_7:35</span>, — and <em>what is heard</em>, a word, a report, as here and in <span class="bvs">Joh_12:38</span> [<span class="bvs">Schleusner </span>] refers to instances in the classics in which the word is used in all these meanings. It is not necessary, nor is it in accordance with the usual manner of the Apostle, to give the word the same meaning in the next verse as in this. It is the practice of the Apostle to use the same words in different senses in the same passage. See <span class="bvs">Rom_4:18</span>; <span class="bvs">Rom_8:24</span>. Here it means what is heard, report; and in the following verse, the act, that is, hearing. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
