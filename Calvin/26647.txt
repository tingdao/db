<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>If you know these things. </em>He declares that they <em>are happy</em>, <em>if they </em>know <em>and </em>do <em>these things</em>; for <em>knowledge </em>is not entitled to be called true, unless it produce such an effect on believers as to lead them to conform themselves to their Head. On the contrary, it is a vain imagination, when we look upon Christ, and the things which belong to Christ, as separate from ourselves. We may infer from this that, until a man has learned to yield to his brethren, he does not <em>know </em>if Christ be <em>the Master</em>. Since there is no man who performs his duty to his brethren hi all respects, and since there are many who are careless and sluggish in brotherly offices, this shows us that we are still at a great distance from the full light of faith. </p></div>
