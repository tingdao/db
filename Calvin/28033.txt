And yet he intimates at the same time, by stating what its object was, that it was not the cause of righteousness, it indeed tended to confirm the righteousness of faith, and that already obtained in uncircumcision. He then derogates or takes away nothing from it. </p><p>We have indeed here a remarkable passage with regard to the general benefits of sacraments. According to the testimony of Paul, they are seals by which the promises of God are in a manner imprinted on our hearts, (<em>Dei promissiones cordibus nostris quodammodo imprimuntur </em>,) and the certainty of grace confirmed (<em>sancitur gratœ certitudo </em>) And though by themselves they profit nothing, yet God has designed them to be the instruments (<em>instrumenta </em>) of his grace; and he effects by the secret grace of his Spirit, that they should not be without benefit in the elect. And though they are dead and unprofitable symbols to the reprobate, they yet ever retain their import and character (<em>vim suam et naturam </em><em>:</em>) for though our unbelief may deprive them of their effect, yet it cannot weaken or extinguish the truth of God. Hence it remains a fixed principle, that sacred symbols are testimonies, by which God seals his grace on our hearts. </p><p>As to the symbol of circumcision, this especially is to be said, that a twofold grace was represented by it. God had promised to Abraham a blessed seed, from whom salvation was to be expected by the whole world. On this depended the promise — “I will be to thee a God.” (<span class="bvs">Gen_17:7</span>.) Then a gratuitous reconciliation with God was included in that symbol: and for this reason it was necessary that the faithful should look forward to the promised seed. On the other hand, God requires integrity and holiness of life; he indicated by the symbol how this could be attained, that is, by cutting off in man whatever is born of the flesh, for his whole nature had become vicious. He therefore reminded Abraham by the external sign, that he was spiritually to cut off the corruption of the flesh; and to this Moses has also alluded in <span class="bvs">Deu_10:16</span>. And to show that it was not the work of man, but of God, he commanded tender infants to be circumcised, who, on account of their age, could not have performed such a command. Moses has indeed expressly mentioned spiritual circumcision as the work of divine power, as you will find in <span class="bvs">Deu_30:6</span>, where he says, “The Lord will circumcise thine heart:” and the Prophets afterwards declared the same thing much more clearly. </p><p>As there are two points in baptism now, so there were formerly in circumcision; for it was a symbol of a new life, and also of the remission of sins. But the fact as to Abraham himself, that righteousness preceded circumcision, is not always the case in sacraments, as it is evident from the case of Isaac and his posterity: but God intended to give such an instance once at the beginning, that no one might ascribe salvation to external signs. <span class="cite-ref">(137)</span></p><p><em>That he might be the father, etc. </em>Mark how the circumcision of Abraham confirms our faith with regard to gratuitous righteousness; for it was the sealing of the righteousness of faith, that righteousness might also be imputed to us who believe. And thus Paul, by a remarkable dexterity makes to recoil on his opponents what they might have adduced as an objection: for since the truth and import (<em>veritas et vis </em>) of circumcision were found in an uncircumcised state, there was no ground for the Jews to elevate themselves so much above the Gentiles. </p><p>But as a doubt might arise, whether it behoves us, after the example of Abraham, to confirm also the same righteousness by the sign of circumcision, how came the Apostle to make this omission? Even because he thought that the question was sufficiently settled by the drift of his argument: for as this truth had been admitted, that circumcision availed only to seal the grace of God, it follows, that it is now of no benefit to us, who have a sign instituted in its place by our Lord. As then there is no necessity now for circumcision, where baptism is, he was not disposed to contend unnecessarily for that respecting which there was no doubt, that is, why the righteousness of faith was not sealed to the Gentiles in the same way as it was to Abraham. <em>To believe in uncircumcision </em>means, that the Gentiles, being satisfied with their own condition, did not introduce the seal of circumcision: and so the proposition <span class="lang el-gr">δια</span>,<em>by </em>is put for <span class="lang el-gr">εν</span>, <em>in </em><span class="cite-ref">(138)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(137)</span> The word “sign” in this passage<span class="lang el-gr">, σημεῖον, </span> seems not to mean an outward token of something inward, but a mark, circumcision itself, which was imprinted, as it were, as a mark in the flesh. So [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] renders it, “The mark of circumcision.” That circumcision was a sign or a symbol of what was spiritual, is evident: but this is not what is taught here. Circumcision is expressly called “a token,” or a sign, in <span class="bvs">Gen_17:11</span>; but it is said to have been “a token of the covenant,” that is, a proof and an evidence of it. The <em>design </em>of circumcision is expressed by the next word<span class="lang el-gr">, σφραγίδα </span> — seal. This sometimes signified the instrument, <span class="bvs">1Kg_21:8</span>; and sometimes the impression, <span class="bvs">Rev_5:1</span> : and the impression was used for various purposes, — to close up a document, to secure a thing, and also to confirm an agreement. It is taken here in the latter sense; circumcision was a “seal,” a confirmation, an evidence, a proof, or a pledge, “of the righteousness” obtained “by faith.” We meet not with any distinct statement of this kind in Genesis: it is what the Apostle had gathered, and rightly gathered, from the account given us of what took place between God and Abraham. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(138)</span> See a similar instance in <span class="bvs">Rom_2:27</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
