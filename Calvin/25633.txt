<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And if you have not been faithful in what belongs to another. </em>By the expression, <em>what belongs to another, </em>he means what is not within man; for God does not bestow riches upon us on condition that we shall be attached to them, but makes us <em>stewards </em>of them in such a manner, that they may not bind us with their chains. And, indeed, it is impossible that our minds should be free and disengaged for dwelling in heaven, if we did not look upon every thing that is in the world as <em>belonging to another </em></p><p><em>Who shall entrust to you what is your own? </em>Spiritual riches, on the other hand, which relate to a future life, are pronounced by him to be <em>our own, </em>because the enjoyment of them is everlasting. But now he employs a different comparison. There is no reason, he tells us, to expect that we shall make a proper and moderate use of <em>our own </em>property, if we have acted improperly or unfaithfully in <em>what belonged to another. </em>Men usually care less about abusing, and allow themselves greater liberty in squandering, <em>their own </em>property, because they are not afraid that any person will find fault with them; but when a thing has been entrusted to them either in charge or in loan, and of which they must afterwards render an account, they are more cautious and more timid. </p><p>We thus ascertain Christ’s meaning to be, that they who are bad <em>stewards </em>of earthly blessings would not be faithful guardians of spiritual gifts. He next introduces a sentence: <em>You cannot serve God and mammon; </em>which I have explained at <span class="bvs">Mat_6:24</span>. There the reader will find an explanation of the word <em>Mammon </em><span class="cite-ref">(301)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(301)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et la aussi on trouvera la signification de ce mot Mammona, lequel est ici mis, et que nous avons traduit </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Richesses </em> ” — “And <em>there </em>will also be found the meaning of the word <em>Mammon, </em>which is used here, and which we have translated <em>Riches. </em>”—In an earlier portion of this Commentary, to which our author refers, (Harmony, vol. 1 p. 337,) no direct or formal explanation of the word <em>Mammon </em>is to be found; but a careful reader of the expository remarks on <span class="bvs">Mat_6:24</span> will easily perceive that Calvin understands <em>riches </em>to be one of the <em>two masters </em>spoken of in that passage. An indirect definition of the term is afforded by his French version of the text, both in <span class="bvs">Mat_6:24</span>, and in <span class="bvs">Luk_16:13</span>, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vous ne pouvez servir a Dieu et aux richesses</span>;” — “<em>you cannot serve God and riches.” </em></p></div></div>
