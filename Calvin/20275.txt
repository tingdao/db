<div class="comment-content"><p><em>And thou shalt say, Jehovah, thou hast spoken against this place </em>It hence appears that Seraiah was commanded to read the book, not for the benefit of hearers, for they would have been doubly deaf to the words of Seraiah. And it is not probable that the Hebrew language was then familiar to the Chaldeans. There is a great affinity, as it is well known, in the languages, but there is also some difference. But we conclude, from this passage, that the reading was in a chamber, or in some secret place; for Seraiah is bidden to fix all his thoughts on God, and to address his words to him. He did not then undertake the work or office of a preacher, so as openly to proclaim all these things to the Babylonians. But having inspected the city, he was to read the book by himself, that is, what had been written. </p><p>And this also deserves to be noticed; for however courageous we may be, yet our constancy and boldness are more apparent when we have to do with men than when we are alone, and God is the only witness; for when no one sees us, we tremble; and though we may have previously appeared to have manly courage, yet when alone, fear lays hold on us. There is hardly one in a hundred who is so bold as he ought to be when God alone is witness. But shame renders us courageous and constrains us to be firm, and the vigor which is almost extinct in private is roused in public. As, then, ambition almost always rules in men, this passage ought to be carefully noticed, where the Prophet commands Seraiah to deal alone with God, and, though no mortal was present, to strengthen himself, by relying on the certain and infallible fidelity of God; <em>Thou shalt </em>then <em>say, Jehovah, etc. </em>And it is doubtless a real experiment of faith, when we consider within ourselves the promises of God, and go not forth before the public to avow our firmness; for when any one in silence acknowledges God to be true, and strengthens himself in his promises, and so disregards the false judgments of all, that were he alone in the world, he would not yet despond, — this is a true and real trial of faith. </p><p><em>Thou shalt </em>then <em>say, Jehovah, thou hast spoken against this place </em>The design of the words was, that Seraiah might feel assured that God was true, and embrace in his presence what he read, and not doubt but that the word, which came from God, would, in due time, be accomplished: how so? because God is true. The word <em>Jehovah, </em>then, ought to be regarded as emphatical; <em>and thou shalt say, Thou, Jehovah, hast spoken against this place; </em>that is, neither Jeremiah, nor any other mortal, is the author of this prophecy; but thou, O Lord, has dictated to thy servant whatever is contained in this volume. </p><p><em>To destroy it, so that there should not be an inhabitant in it, neither man nor beast: </em>how so? <em>because it shall be reduced to desolations, </em>or the particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span><em>, ki, </em>may be taken adversatively, <em>but it shall be reduced to perpetual desolations </em><span class="cite-ref">(113)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(113)</span> Literally the words are, — </p><p>For desolations of perpetuity shall it (or she) be. </p><p>Babylon is sometimes referred to as masculine, and sometimes as feminine. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
