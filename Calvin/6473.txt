<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Else if you do in any wise go back, </em>etc According to the usual method observed in the Law, he adds threatening, in order that if they are not sufficiently allured by the divine goodness, they may be aroused by fear to the performance of their duty. It is, indeed, disgraceful for men, when God graciously condescends to invite them, not at once to run forward and meet the invitation by prompt and alert obedience; but such is the lethargy of the flesh, that it always requires to be stimulated by threats. Joshua, therefore, adopts the usual method of the Law, while he reminds the Israelites of the terrors of the Lord, provided they do not of their own accord embrace his offered favor. Moreover, it is not once only that, he sets before them the denunciation that the nations of Canaan will be scourges to their sides and thorns in their eyes if they become familiar with them. <em>First, </em>inasmuch as God had consecrated the land to himself, he wished it to be purged of all impurities; and <em>secondly, </em>inasmuch as he saw how prone the people were to be corrupted by bad example, he wished also to provide a remedy for this evil. Then, while on the one hand the people counted it as nothing that the land should be contaminated by impious superstitions, and that idols should be worshipped in it instead of the true God, and on the other hand, eagerly contracted contagion from their vices, it was only a just punishment of this gross contempt that they should experience molestation and hostility from those whom they had improperly <span class="cite-ref">(191)</span> spared. </p><p>That the threatening which both Moses and Joshua thus denounced were openly accomplished, is but too plain from the Book of Judges. And yet this promulgation of the divine vengeance was not altogether useless; for after Joshua was dead, they became courageous enough to engage in war. Their ardor, however, proved evanescent, <span class="cite-ref">(192)</span> and they shortly after were initiated in nefarious Gentile rites. Hence, we perceive in the human mind an intemperate longing for perverse worship, a longing which no curbs are able to restrain. </p><p>It is now proper to consider how far this doctrine is applicable to us. It is true a special command was given to the ancient people to destroy the nations of Canaan, and keep aloof from all profane defilement’s. To us, in the present day, no certain region marks out our precise boundaries; nor are we armed with the sword to slay all the ungodly; we have only to beware of allowing ourselves to become involved in fellowship with wickedness, by not keeping at a sufficient distance from it. For it is almost impossible, if we mingle with it, spontaneously to avoid receiving some spot or blemish. But this point having been elsewhere expounded, I now merely advert to it in passing. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(191)</span> Latin, “Male.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">A tort et contre leur devoir</span>;” “Wrongfully and contrary to their duty.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(192)</span> Latin, “Verum evanidus fuit fervor ille.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais c’a este un feu de paille comme on dit: car leur ardeur n’a gueres dure</span>;” “But it was a fire of straw, as it is called; for their ardor was not durable.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
