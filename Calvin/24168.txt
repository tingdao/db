<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>Then were crucified with him two robbers. </em>It was the finishing stroke of the lowest disgrace when Christ was executed between <em>two robbers; </em>for they assigned him the most prominent place, as ifâ€™ he had been the prince of <em>robbers. </em>If he had been <em>crucified </em>apart from the other malefactors, there might have appeared to be a distinction between his case and theirs; but now he is not only confounded with them, but raised aloft, as if he had been by far the most detestable of all. On this account Mark applies to him the prediction of Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_53:12</span>) <em>he was reckoned among transgressors; </em>for the prophet expressly says concerning Christ, that he will deliver his people, not by pomp and splendor, but because he will endure the punishment clue to their sins. In order that he might free us from condemnation, this kind of expiation was necessary, that he might place himself in, our room. Here we perceive how dreadful is the weight of the wrath of God against sins, for appeasing which it became necessary that Christ, who is eternal justice, should be ranked with robbers. We see, also, the inestimable love of Christ towards us, who, in order that he might admit us to the society of the holy angels, permitted himself to be classed as one of the wicked. </p></div>
