<div class="comment-content"><p>As Luke mentions that <em>the cup </em>was twice presented by Christ, we must inquire, in the first place, if it be a repetition, (as the Evangelists are wont frequently to say the same thing twice,) or if Christ, after having tasted the cup, repeated the same thing a second time. This latter conjecture appears to me to be probable; for we know that the holy fathers, during sacrifices, observed the solemn rite of tasting the cup; <span class="cite-ref">(188)</span> and hence those words of the Psalmist, </p><p>I will take the cup of salvation,<LineBreak />and will call on the name of the Lord, (<span class="bvs">Psa_116:13</span>.) </p><p>I have no doubt, therefore, that Christ, according to the ancient custom, tasted <em>the cup </em>in the holy feast, which otherwise could not have been correctly observed; and Luke expressly mentions this, before coming to give an account of the new mystery, which was a totally different institution from the paschal lamb. It was in compliance also with received and ordinary custom, that he is expressly said to have <em>given thanks, </em>after having <em>taken the cup. </em>For at the commencement of the supper, I have no doubt, he prayed, as he was accustomed never to sit down at table without calling on God; but now he wished to discharge once more the same duty, that he might not leave out a ceremony which, I have just now shown, was connected with the sacred act of <em>taking the cup </em>and tasting it. <span class="cite-ref">(189)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(188)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que les saincts peres ont observé ceste ceremonie solennelle de prendre la coupe, et gouster un peu de ce qui estoit dedans</span>;” — “that the holy fathers observed this ceremony of taking the cup, and tasting a little of what was within it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(189)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De prende la coupe, et en gouster</span>.” </p></div></div>
