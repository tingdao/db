It is the cause alone which maketh the difference; but this difference is so highly esteemed before God and his angels, that the rebukes of the martyrs <span class="cite-ref">(480)</span> do far excel all glory of the world. Yet here may a question be moved, How it was lawful for the Jews to stone Stephen, who had not the government in their hands? For in Christ’s cause they answer, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death. I answer, that they did this violently and in an uproar. And whereas the president did not punish this wickedness, it may be that he winked at many things, <span class="cite-ref">(481)</span> lest they should bring that hatred upon his own head which they bare against the name of Christ. We see that the Roman presidents did chiefly wink at the civil discords of that nation, even of set purpose; that when one of them had murdered another, <span class="cite-ref">(482)</span> they might the sooner be overcome afterward. </p><p><strong>(480)</strong> “Martyrum probra,” the ignominy. </p><p><strong>(481)</strong> “In populo turbulento et prope indomito,” in a turbulent and almost untameable people, omitted. </p><p><strong>(482)</strong> “Ut mutuo confecti,” that having mutually destroyed each other. </p></div>
