<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>For he must reign </em>He proves that the time is not yet come when Christ will <em>deliver up the kingdom to the Father, </em>with the view of showing at the same time that the <em>end </em>has not yet come, when all things will be put into a right and tranquil state, because Christ has not yet subdued all his enemies. Now that <em>must </em>be brought about, <em>because </em>the Father has placed him at his right hand with this understanding, that he is not to resign the authority that he has received, until they have been subdued under his power. And this is said for the consolation of the pious, that they may not be impatient on account of the long delay of the resurrection. This statement occurs in <span class="bvs">Psa_110:1</span></p><p>Paul, however, may seem to refine upon the word <em>until </em>beyond what the simple and natural meaning of the word requires; for the Spirit does not in that passage give intimation of what shall be afterwards, but simply of what must be previously. I answer, that Paul does not conclude that Christ will <em>deliver up the kingdom to the Father, </em>on the ground of its having been so predicted in the Psalm, but he has made use of this quotation from the Psalm, for the purpose of proving that the day of <em>delivering up the kingdom </em>had not yet arrived, because Christ has still to do with his enemies. Paul, however, explains in passing what is meant by Christ’s sitting at the right hand of the Father, when in place of that figurative expression he makes use of the simple word <em>reign. </em></p><p><em>The last enemy </em>— <em>death </em>We see that there are still many enemies that resist Christ, and obstinately oppose his reign. But <em>death </em>will be <em>the last enemy </em><span class="cite-ref">(54)</span><em>that will be destroyed. </em>Hence Christ must still be the administrator of his Father’s kingdom. Let believers, therefore, be of good courage, and not give up hope, until everything that must precede the resurrection be accomplished. It is asked, however, in what sense he affirms that death shall be the <em>last enemy </em><span class="cite-ref">(55)</span><em>that will be destroyed, </em>when it has been already destroyed by Christ’s death, or at least, by his resurrection, which is the victory over death, and the attainment of life? I answer, that it was <em>destroyed </em>in such a way as to be no longer deadly to believers, but not in such a way as to occasion them no uneasiness. The Spirit of God, it is true, dwelling in us is life; but we still carry about with us a mortal body. (<span class="bvs">1Pe_1:24</span>.) The substance of death in us will one day be drained off, but it has not been so as yet. We are <em>born again of incorruptible seed, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Pe_1:23</span>,) but we have not yet arrived at perfection. Or to sum up the matter briefly in a similitude, the sword of death which could penetrate into our very hearts has been blunted. It wounds nevertheless still, but without any danger; <span class="cite-ref">(56)</span> for we die, but by dying we enter into life. In fine, as Paul teaches elsewhere as to sin, (<span class="bvs">Rom_6:12</span>,) such must be our view as to death — that <em>it dwells </em>indeed in us, but it does not <em>reign </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(54)</span><em>“It </em>may not be improper to remark that there is an inaccuracy in our common version, which so vitiates its application that it does not seem to sustain the conclusion to which the Apostle had arrived. It was his purpose to establish the perfection of our Savior’s conquest, the advancement of his triumphs, and the prostration of all enemies whatever beneath his power. Now to say that ‘the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’ by no means affords a proof of this position. Though death might be destroyed, and be the last enemy that shall be destroyed, it would not thence appear but that other enemies might remain not destroyed. But the proper rendering is, ‘Death, the last enemy, should be destroyed.’” — <em>R. Hall’s Works, </em>(Loud. 1846,) volume 6. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(55)</span><em>“ </em><em>Ultimum </em>vero seu <em>novissimum hostem </em>cur vocat? <em>Chrysostomus </em>putat, quia ultimo accessit. <em>Primus </em>fuit Satan, solicitaris hominem ad pecca-tum. <em>Alter </em>voluntas hominis, sponte se a Deo avertens. <em>Tentius </em>pecca-tum. <em>Quartus </em>denique mors, superveniens peccato. Sed baud dubie Apostolus novissimum vocat duratione, respectu aliorum externorum hos-tium Ecclesiae, quos Christus in fine abolebit omnes.

Chrysostom </em>thinks, because it came last. The <em>first </em>was Satan tempting man to sin. The <em>second </em>— <em>man’s </em>will, voluntarily turning aside from God. The <em>third </em>— <em>sin. </em>Then at length the <em>fourth </em>— death, following in the train of sin. There can be no doubt, however, that the Apostle calls it the <em>last </em>in respect of duration, in relation to the other external enemies of the Church, all of which Christ will in the end abolish. Last of all, he will drive away the death of the body, by raising up all from death, that this mortal may put on immortality.” <em>Fareus </em>in loc. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(56)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais c’est sans danger de mort</span>;” — “But it is without danger of death.” </p></div></div>
