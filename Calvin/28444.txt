He discovers the utmost dexterity in this respect, that in making mention of those things which had rendered him contemptible, he affords clear proof of his singular fidelity and indefatigable zeal for the advancement of the gospel; and, on the other hand, he tacitly reproves his rivals, who, while they had furnished no such proof, were desirous, nevertheless, to be held in the highest esteem. In the words themselves there is no obscurity, except that we must take notice of the distinction between those two participles — <span class="lang el-gr">λοιδορουμενοι και βλασφημουμενοι</span> (<em>reviled </em>and <em>defamed</em>.) As <span class="lang el-gr">λοιδορια</span> means — that harsher sort of raillery, which does not merely give a person a slight touch, but a sharp bite, and blackens his character by open contumely, there can be no doubt that <span class="lang el-gr">λοιδορειν</span> means — wounding a person with reproach as with a sting. <span class="cite-ref">(241)</span> I have accordingly rendered it — <em>harassed with revilings </em><span class="lang el-gr">Βλασφημια</span> signifies a more open reproach, when any one is severely and atrociously slandered. <span class="cite-ref">(242)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(241)</span><span class="lang el-gr">λοιδορια</span>, is supposed by Eustathius to be derived from <span class="lang el-gr">λογος</span>, a <em>word</em>, and <span class="lang el-gr">δορυ</span>,<em>a spear </em>A similar figure is employed by the Psalmist, when he speaks of words that are <em>drawn swords </em>(<span class="bvs">Psa_55:21</span>.) — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(242)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Or </span><em class="lang fr-fr">le premier </em><span class="lang fr-fr">signifie non seulement se gaudir d’vn homme, mais aussi toucher son honneur comme en le blasonnant, et le naurer en termes picquans: ce que nous disons communement, Mordre en riant. </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Le second </em><span class="lang fr-fr">signifie quand on detracte apertement de quelqu’vn sans vser de couuerture de paroles</span>;” — “Now <em>the first </em>means not simply to make one’s self merry at another’s expense, but also to touch his reputation, as if with the view of blackening it, and wounding it by cutting expressions, as we commonly say — to give a good humored bite. <em>The second </em>means when persons slander any one openly, without using any disguise of words.” </p></div></div>
