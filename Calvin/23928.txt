<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And call no man on earth your Father. </em>He claims for God alone the honor of <em>Father, </em>in nearly the same sense as he lately asserted that he himself is the only <em>Master; </em>for this name was not assumed by men for themselves, but was given to them by God. And therefore it is not only lawful <em>to call men on earth fathers</em>, but it would be wicked to deprive them of that honor. Nor is there any importance in the distinction which some have brought forward, that men, by whom children have been begotten, are <em>fathers </em>according to the flesh, but that God alone is <em>the Father of spirits. </em>I readily acknowledge that in this manner God is sometimes distinguished from men, as in <span class="bvs">Heb_12:5</span>, but as Paul more than once calls himself a spiritual <em>father, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_4:15</span>,) we must see how this agrees with the words of Christ. The true meaning therefore is, that the honor of a <em>father </em>is falsely ascribed to men, when it obscures the glory of God. Now this is done, whenever a mortal man, viewed apart from God, is accounted <em>a father, </em>since all the degrees of relationship depend on God alone through Christ, and are held together in such a manner that, strictly speaking, God alone is the <em>Father </em>of all. </p></div>
