So much the more ridiculous is the superstition of Papists, who, disregarding everything else in the Virgin Mary, extol her only on the ground of relationship, bestowing on her the title of the Mother of Christ, <span class="cite-ref">(180)</span> as if Christ himself had not reproved the woman who exclaimed from the midst of the crowd, </p><p>Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the breasts that suckled thee; for Christ replied, Nay, rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Luk_11:27</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(180)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le titre de Mere de Christ</span>.” </p></div></div>
