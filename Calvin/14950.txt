<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Deliver me from the mire, that I may not sink. </em>The Psalmist repeats the same similitude which he had used before, but in a different manner. He had previously said that he was sunk in the mire, and now he prays that he may not sink in it. In short, he now prays that those things may not now befall him which he had formerly complained of as having befallen him. But it is very easy to reconcile this diversity of statement; for in the opening of the psalm he spake according to his actual feeling and experience; but now, looking to the issue, although living in the midst of death, he cherishes the hope of deliverance. This is expressed still more clearly in the last clause of the 15<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, where he prays, <em>Let not the pit close its mouth upon me; </em>which is as if he had said, Let not the great multitude and weight of my afflictions overwhelm me, and let not sorrow swallow me up. </p></div>
