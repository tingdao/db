<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet, by saying that he went to the Euphrates, confirms what he had narrated: he did not indeed mean that he actually went there, but his object was to give the Jews a vivid representation. It is then what Rhetorians call a scene presented to the view; though the place is not changed, yet the thing is set before the eyes by a lively description. <span class="cite-ref">(71)</span> Thus the Prophet, as the Jews were deaf, exhibited to their view what they would not hear. This is the reason why he says that he <em>went. </em>For the same purpose is what follows, that at <em>the end of many days </em>God had bidden him to take out the <em>girdle </em>Here also is signified the length of the exile. As to the <em>hole in a rock, </em>what is meant is disgrace; for without honor and esteem the Jews lived in banishment, in the same manner as though they were cast into a cavern. Hence by the hole is signified their ignoble and base condition, that they were like persons removed from the sight of all men and from the common light of day. By the <em>end of many days, </em>is meant, as I have said, the length of their exile, for in a short time they would not have become putrified, and except indeed this had been distinctly expressed, they would have never been convinced of the grievousness of the calamity which was nigh them. Hence he says that the days would be many, so that they might contract putridity while hidden in the hole. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(71)</span> Many agree with Calvin that this was a vision and not an actual transaction, such as <em>Gataker, Lowth, Blayney, Adara Clarke</em>, &amp;c. <em>Henry </em>hesitates, but Scott seems to be strongly in favor of a real transaction. <em>Bochart </em>and <em>Venema </em>hold also the latter opinion, only they think that <span class="lang he-il">פרת</span> here does not mean “Euphrates,” but Ephrata, that is, Bethlehem, in Judea; but this cannot be maintained. Lowth refers to an instance where a vision is related as a fact, without any mention being made that it was a vision, that is, <span class="bvs">Gen_15:5</span> : God brought Abraham forth and shewed to him the stars; and yet it appears from <span class="bvs">Jer_13:12</span> that the sun was not set. <em>Blayney </em>remarks, that “the same supposition of a vision must be admitted in other cases, particularly <span class="bvs">Jer_25:15</span>.” <em>Gataker </em>refers to similar instances in <span class="bvs">Eze_8:3</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_11:24</span>. It was most probably a vision; and the Prophet related to the people what God had in a supernatural way exhibited to him. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
