<div class="comment-content"><p>It is then added, <em>Their chiefs will send the common people to the waters </em>The Prophet’s object was again to point out something extraordinary, — that the great, possessing authority, would constrain and compel the common sort to draw water. They have <em>sent </em>them, he says, that is, by authority; they who could command others sent them to the waters. <span class="cite-ref">(106)</span><em>They came, </em>he says, <em>to the cisterns </em>By the word <span class="lang he-il">גבים</span><em>gabim, </em>he means deep ditches, or pits; but some render them cisterns. With regard to the subject in hand, it signifies not; for the Prophet no doubt meant that they would come to the deepest wells or pits, as it is usually done ia a great drought; for many springs become often dry, and pits also, situated in high places; but in valleys some water remains, and there it may be had: there are also some wells ever full of water, where its abundance never fails. It was therefore the Prophet’s design to refer to such wells. <em>They came, </em>he says, <em>to the wells, </em>where they thought they could find a sufficient supply; but he adds, <em>They found no waters; they returned with their empty vessels </em><span class="cite-ref">(107)</span></p><p>We now perceive what I have said, — that the Prophet here reproves the Jews for their stupidity in not understanding that God was angry with them when the order of nature, which ought ever to continue the same, thus failed. Droughts indeed often happen when there are no waters in most places; but when no well supplies any water, when there is not a drop of water to be found in the most favorable places, then indeed it ought to be concluded that God’s curse is on the people, who find nothing to drink; for in nothing does God deal more bountifully with the world than in the supply of water. We do not speak now of wine; but we see fountains everywhere pouring forth waters, and rivers also flow through countries: moreover, pits are dug through the labors of men; there are also cisterns in which the rain is preserved in places that are commonly dry: but when in cisterns no water remains, and when the fountains themselves refuse any supply, we may hence surely know that it is the special judgment of God; and this is what Jeremiah intended here to shew; and therefore he says that they were <em>confounded </em>and <em>ashamed, </em>and that they <em>covered their head </em>It now follows — </p><p><strong>(106)</strong> The persons here mentioned are called by the <em>Septuagint </em>“chieftains — <span class="lang el-gr">μεγιστᾶνες</span>,” and “young men — <span class="lang el-gr">τους νεωτέρους</span>;” by the <em>Vulqate, </em>“the elder ones — majores,” and “the younger ones — minores;” by the <em>Syriac, </em>“the chiefs,” and “the common sort;” and by the <em>Targum, </em>“chief men,” and “subjects.” The first word is well expressed in our version, “nobles,” — the illustrious; and the most suitable word for the others is “menials;” they were the servants. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><strong>(107)</strong> would render the verse thus, — </p><p><strong>3.</strong>When their nobles sent their menials for water, They came to the reservoirs, they found no water; They brought back their vessels empty: They were ashamed and confounded, And they covered their heads. </p><p>The word I render “reservoirs” means literally arches or vaults. They were places arched over to preserve water. <em>Parkhurst </em>thinks that the reservoirs made by King Hezekiah are intended, <span class="bvs">2Ch_32:30</span>. That the verb <span class="lang he-il">שב</span> has the meaning of bringing back is evident from <span class="bvs">Isa_52:8</span>; and this is according to the <em>Vulgate </em>and the <em>Septuagint </em>in this place. <em>Gataker </em>and <em>Venema </em>think that the shame and confusion refer to the nobles, and not to the servants. This verse speaks of Jerusalem, the last mentioned in the former verse; and what follows refers to Judea, spoken of in the former part according to the usual manner of the prophets. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
