<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Happy are the peacemakers </em>By <em>peacemakers </em>he means those who not only seek peace and avoid quarrels, as far as lies in their power, but who also labor to settle differences among others, who advise all men to live at peace, and take away every occasion of hatred and strife. There are good grounds for this statement. As it is a laborious and irksome employment to reconcile those who are at variance, persons of a mild disposition, who study to promote peace, are compelled to endure the indignity of hearing reproaches, complaints, and remonstrances on all sides. The reason is, that every one would desire to have advocates, who would defend his cause. That we may not depend on the favor of men, Christ bids us look up to the judgment of his Father, who is <em>the God of peace, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_15:33</span>,) and who accounts us his children, while we cultivate peace, though our endeavors may not be acceptable to men: for <em>to be called </em>means <em>To Be Accounted the children of God </em></p></div>
