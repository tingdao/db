<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>For if their rejections, etc. </em>This passage, which many deem obscure, and some awfully pervert, ought, in my view, to be understood as another argument, derived from a comparison of the less with the greater, according to this import, “Since the rejection of the Jews has availed so much as to occasion the reconciling of the Gentiles, how much more effectual will be their resumption? Will it not be to raise them even from the dead?” For Paul ever insists on this, that the Gentiles have no cause for envy, as though the restoration of the Jews to favor were to render their condition worse. Since then God has wonderfully drawn forth life from death and light from darkness, how much more ought we to hope, he reasons, that the resurrection of a people, as it were, wholly dead, will bring life to the Gentiles. <span class="cite-ref">(353)</span> It is no objection what some allege, that reconciliation differs not from resurrection, as we do indeed understand resurrection in the present instance, that is, to be that by which we are translated from the kingdom of death to the kingdom of life, for though the thing is the same, yet there is more force in the expression, and this a sufficient answer. </p><p><strong>(353)</strong> Some view the last words, “life from the dead,” as understood of the Jews and not of the Gentiles. But the antithesis seems to require the latter meaning. The rejection or casting away<span class="lang el-gr">, ἀποβολὴ </span> of the Jews was the occasion of reconciliation to the world, that is, the Gentiles; then the reception<span class="lang el-gr">, πρόσληψις, </span> of the Jews will be “life from the dead” to the Gentiles or to the world. He expresses by stronger terms the sentiment in <span class="bvs">Rom_11:12</span>, “the riches of the world,” only intimating, as it appears, the decayed state of religion among the Gentiles; for to be dead sometimes means a religious declension, <span class="bvs">Rev_3:1</span>; or a state of oppression and wretchedness, as the case was with the Israelites when in captivity, <span class="bvs">Eze_37:1</span>; <span class="bvs">Isa_26:19</span>. The phrase is evidently figurative, and signifies a wonderful revival, such as the coming to life of those in a condition resembling that of death. The restoration of the Jews unto God’s favor will occasion the revival and spread of true religion through the whole Gentile world. This is clearly the meaning. </p><p>Some of the fathers, such as [<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Theodoret </span>], regarded the words as referring to the last resurrection: but this is wholly at variance with the context. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
