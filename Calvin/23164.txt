<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>As he was a just man </em>Some commentators explain this to mean, that Joseph, <em>because </em>he was a just man, determined to spare his wife: <span class="cite-ref">(98)</span> taking <em>justice </em>to be only another name for humanity, or, a gentle and merciful disposition. But others more correctly read the two clauses as contrasted with each other: that Joseph <em>was a just man, </em>but yet that he was anxious about the reputation of his wife. That justice, on which a commendation is here bestowed, consisted in hatred and abhorrence of crime. Suspecting his wife of adultery, and even convinced that she was an adulterer, he was unwilling to hold out the encouragement of lenity to such a crime. <span class="cite-ref">(99)</span> And certainly he is but a pander <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> to his wife, who connives at her unchastity. Not only is such wickedness regarded with abhorrence by good and honorable minds, but that winking at crime which I have mentioned is marked by the laws with infamy. </p><p>Joseph, therefore, moved by an ardent love <em>of justice, </em>condemned the crime of which he supposed his wife to have been guilty; while the gentleness of his disposition prevented him from going to the utmost rigor of law. It was a moderate and calmer method to depart privately, and remove to a distant place. <span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> Hence we infer, that he was not of so soft and effeminate a disposition, as to screen and promote uncleanness under the pretense of merciful dealing: he only made some abatement from stern justice, so as not to expose his wife to evil report. Nor ought we to have any hesitation in believing, that his mind was restrained by a secret inspiration of the Spirit. We know how weak jealousy is, and to what violence it hurries its possessor. Though Joseph did not proceed to rash and headlong conduct, yet he was wonderfully preserved from many imminent dangers, which would have sprung out of his resolution to depart. </p><p>The same remark is applicable to Mary’s silence. Granting that modest reserve prevented her from venturing to tell her husband, that <em>she was with child by the Holy Spirit, </em>it was not so much by her own choice, as by the providence of God that she was restrained. Let us suppose her to have spoken. The nature of the case made it little short of incredible. Joseph would have thought himself ridiculed, and everybody would have treated the matter as a laughing-stock: after which the Divine announcement, if it had followed, would have been of less importance. The Lord permitted his servant Joseph to be betrayed by ignorance into an erroneous conclusion, that, by his own voice, he might bring him back to the right path. </p><p>Yet it is proper for us to know, that this was done more on our account than for his personal advantage: for every necessary method was adopted by God, to prevent unfavorable suspicion from falling on the heavenly message. When the angel approaches Joseph, who is still unacquainted with the whole matter, wicked men have no reason to charge him with being influenced by prejudice to listen to the voice of God. He was not overcome by the insinuating address of his wife. His previously formed opinion was not shaken by entreaties. He was not induced by human arguments to take the opposite side. But, while the groundless accusation of his wife was still rankling in his mind, God interposed between them, that we might regard Joseph as a more competent witness, and possessing greater authority, as a messenger sent to us from heaven. We see how God chose to employ an angel in informing his servant Joseph, that to others he might be a heavenly herald, and that the intelligence which he conveyed might not be borrowed from his wife, or from any mortal. </p><p>The reason why this mystery was not immediately made known to a greater number of persons appears to be this. It was proper that this inestimable treasure should remain concealed, and that the knowledge of it should be imparted to none but the children of God. Nor is it absurd to say, that the Lord intended, as he frequently does, to put the faith and obedience of his own people to the trial. Most certainly, if any man shall maliciously refuse to believe and obey God in this matter, he will have abundant reason to be satisfied with the proofs by which this article of our faith is supported. For the same reason, the Lord permitted Mary to enter into the married state, that under the veil of marriage, till the full time for revealing it, the heavenly conception of the virgin might be concealed. Meanwhile, the knowledge of it was withheld from unbelievers, as their ingratitude and malice deserved. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(98)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Joseph a voulu pardonner a sa femme, et couvrir la faute, d'autant qu'il estoit juste</span>.” — “That Joseph intended to forgive his wife, and conceal her offense, <em>because he was just.” </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(99)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ne vouloit point nourrir le mal en dissimulant et faisant semblant de n'y voir rien</span>.” — “He did not wish to encourage wickedness, by dissembling and pretending that he did not see it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(100)</span> “Leno;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">macquereau</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le moyen le plus doux et le moins scandaleux estoit, que secretement il departist du lieu, et la laissast sans faire aueun bruit</span>.” — “The mildest and least scandalous method was, that he should depart secretly from the place, and leave her without making any noise.” </p></div></div>
