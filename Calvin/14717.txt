<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>The righteous also shall see, and fear </em><span class="cite-ref">(280)</span> He here adduces, as another reason why the ruin of Doeg might be expected, that an important end would be obtained by it, in so far as it would promote religion in the hearts of the Lord’s people, and afford them a refreshing display of the Divine justice. Should it take place, it would be witnessed by the ungodly as well as by the righteous; but there are two reasons why the Psalmist represents it as being seen especially by the latter. The wicked are incapable of profiting by the judgments of God, being blind to the plainest manifestations which he has made of himself in his works, and it was only the righteous therefore who could see it. Besides, the great end which God has in view, when he prostrates the pride of the ungodly, is the comfort of his own people, that he may show to them the care with which he watches over their safety. It is they, therefore, whom David represents as witnessing this spectacle of Divine justice. And when he says that they would <em>fear, </em>it is not meant that they would tremble, or experience any slavish apprehension, but that their reverential regard for God would be increased by this proof of his care of their interests. When left exposed to the injurious treatment of their enemies, they are apt to be distressed with doubts as to the concern which he takes in the government of the world. But such illustrations to the contrary have the effect of quickening their discouraged zeal, and promoting that fear which is by no means inconsistent with the joy spoken of in the close of the verse. They are led to reverence him the more when they see that he is the avenger of cruelty and injustice: on the other hand, when they perceive that he appears in defense of their cause, and joins common battle with them against their adversaries, they are naturally filled with the most triumphant joy. The beautiful play upon the words <em>see </em>and <em>fear, </em>in the Hebrew, cannot be transferred to our language; the form of the expression intimates that they would see, and see effectually. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(280)</span> French and Skinner read, “The righteous shall see it, and feel reverence; — <em>feel reverence</em>, <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , in the punishment of this wicked man, find additional reason to reverence God, and to observe his righteous laws.” </p></div></div>
