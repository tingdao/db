<div class="comment-content"><p>It ought to be observed, also, that the appellation of <em>false witnesses </em>is applied not to those who contrive a lie which had no foundation, but to those who calumniously pervert what was justly said, and turn it into a crime; an instance of which is here expressly related as to <em>the destruction and rebuilding of the temple. </em>Christ had indeed said, that when </p><p>the temple of his body was destroyed,<LineBreak />he would raise it up within three days, (<span class="bvs">Joh_2:19</span>.) </p><p>The <em>false witnesses </em>do not now resort to some new contrivance, but they put a wrong interpretation on his words, as if he boasted that he would practice some juggling in <em>building the temple. </em>Now as the calumny was trivial and worthless, we may readily infer from it how greatly the priests and scribes were blinded by their fury, since, without any pretext, they demand that Christ shall be put to death. </p></div>
