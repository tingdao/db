And this is what the Prophet now means by saying that all joy had ceased, and that all dances were converted into mourning. </p><p><strong>(234)</strong> The words ought rather to be thus rendered, — </p><p>Turned into mourning was our piping. </p><p>The word does not mean dancing, but playing on some fistular instrument. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
