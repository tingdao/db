<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>But I fear </em>He begins to explain, what is the nature of that <em>virginity </em>of which he has made mention — our cleaving to Christ alone, sincerely, with our whole heart. God, indeed, everywhere requires from us, that we be joined with him in body and in spirit, and he warns us that he is a <em>jealous God, </em>(<span class="bvs">Exo_20:5</span>,) to avenge with the utmost severity the wrong done to him, in the event of any one’s drawing back from him. This connection, however, is accomplished in Christ, as Paul teaches in Ephesians, (<span class="bvs">Eph_5:25</span>.) He points out, however, at present the means of it — when we remain in the pure simplicity of the gospel, for, as in contracting marriages among men, there are written contracts <span class="cite-ref">(802)</span> drawn out, so the spiritual connection between us and the Son of God is confirmed by the gospel, as a kind of written contract. <span class="cite-ref">(803)</span> Let us maintain the fidelity, love, and obedience, that have been there promised by us; he will be faithful to us on his part. </p><p>Now Paul says that he is concerned, that the minds of the Corinthians may not be <em>corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ </em>Paul, it is true, says in Greek <span class="lang el-gr">εἰς Χριστόν</span><em>, </em>which Erasmus renders <em>towards Christ, </em><span class="cite-ref">(804)</span> but the Old Interpreter has come nearer, in my opinion, to Paul’s intention, <span class="cite-ref">(805)</span> because by the <em>simplicity that is in Christ </em>is meant, that which keeps us in the unadulterated and pure doctrine of the gospel, and admits of no foreign admixtures <span class="cite-ref">(806)</span> By this he intimates that men’s minds are <em>adulterated, </em><span class="cite-ref">(807)</span> whenever they turn aside, even in the least degree, to the one side or to the other, from the pure doctrine of Christ. Nor is it without good reason, for who would not condemn a matron as guilty of unchastity, so soon as she lends an ear to a seducer? So in like manner we, when we admit wicked and false teachers, who are Satan’s vile agents, show but too clearly, that we do not maintain conjugal fidelity towards Christ. We must also take notice of the term <em>simplicity, </em>for Paul’s fear was not, lest the Corinthians should all at once openly draw back altogether from Christ, but lest, by turning aside, by little and little, from the simplicity which they had learned, so as to go after profane and foreign contrivances, they should at length become adulterated. </p><p>He brings forward a comparison <em>as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty </em>For if false teachers have a show of wisdom, if they have any power of eloquence for persuading, if they plausibly insinuate themselves into the minds of their hearers, and instill their poison by fawning artifices, it was in a similar way that Satan also <em>beguiled Eve, </em>as he did not openly declare himself to be an enemy, but crept in privily under a specious pretext. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(802)</span><em>Tabuloe </em> — <em>Juvenal </em>makes use of this term in the same sense: “Signatae <em>tabuloe </em><em>; </em>” — “The <em>marriage contract </em>is signed.” — (Juv. 2 119.)
