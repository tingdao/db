<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph</em>. We see that Pharaoh offers himself as a disciple to Joseph, being persuaded, by the statement of the butler, that he is a prophet of God. This is, indeed, a constrained humility; but it is expressly recorded, in order that, when the opportunity of learning <span class="cite-ref">(157)</span> is afforded us, we may not refuse reverently to honor the gifts of the Spirit. Now, though Joseph, in referring Pharaoh to God, seems to deny that he himself is about to interpret the dream, yet his answer bears on a different point: for, because he knew that he was conversing with a heathen addicted to superstitions, he wishes, above all things, to ascribe to God the glory due to him; as if he had said, I am able to do nothing in this matter, nor will I offer anything as from myself; but God alone shall be the interpreter of his own secret. <span class="cite-ref">(158)</span> Should any one object, that whenever God uses the agency of men, their office ought to be referred to in connection with his command: that indeed I acknowledge, but yet so that the whole glory may remain with God; according to the saying of St. Paul, </p><p>“Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_3:7</span>.) </p><p>Moreover, Joseph not only desires to imbue the mind of Pharaoh with some relish for piety, but, by ascribing the gift of interpreting dreams to God alone, confesses that he is destitute of it, until he obtains it from God. Wherefore, let us also learn, from the example of holy Joseph, to honor the grace of God even among unbelievers; and if they shut the door against the entire and full doctrine of piety; we must, at least, endeavor to instill some drops of it into their minds. Let us also reflect on this, that nothing is less tolerable than for men to arrogate to themselves anything as their own; for this is the first step of wisdom, to ascribe nothing to ourselves; but modestly to confess, that whatever in us is worthy of praise, flows only from the fountain of God’s grace. It is especially worthy of notice, that as the Spirit of understanding is given to any one from heaven, he will become a proper and faithful interpreter of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(157)</span> In the Amsterdam edition, it is “facultas decendi,” but in Hengstenberg’s it is “facultas discendi;” and as the French version has it “<span class="lang fr-fr">le moyen d’apprendre</span>,” there can be no doubt that the later Latin edition is right. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(158)</span> The force of Joseph’s language is remarkable: “Without me, God will answer to the peace of Pharaoh.” He thus entirely renounces, in a single word, all the personal honor which the heathen monarch was disposed to pay him, that God alone may have the glory due unto his name. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
