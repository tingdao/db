<div class="comment-content"><p>Here, by another figure, Jeremiah expresses what he had said of the destruction of Babylon, even that in the middle of the slaughter, they would have no strength to resist: they would, at the same time, perish amidst great confusion; and thus he anticipates what might have been advanced against his prophecy. For the Babylonians had been superior to all other nations; how then could it be, that a power so invincible should perish? Though they were as lions, says the Prophet, yet that would avail nothing; they will indeed roar, but roaring will be of no service to them; they will roar as the whelps of lions, but still they will perish. </p><p>We now, then, understand the object of this comparison, even that the superior power by which the Babylonians had terrified all men would avail them nothing, for nothing would remain for them in their calamity except roaring. <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> It follows, — </p><p><strong>(100)</strong> Taking this verse is connection with the following, <em>Gataker </em>and <em>Lowth </em>give somewhat another view, — that the Babylonians roared like lions and shouted with exultation <em>before </em>the city was taken. It is said by <em>Herodotus</em>, that “they ascended the walls, and capered, and loaded Darius and his army with reproaches.” They roared with rage at their enemies, and excited themselves as whelps when beginning to hunt for themselves, full of life and animation, — </p><p>Together as young lions shall they roar. And rouse themselves as whelps of lionesses. </p><p>There is a <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> wanting before the last verb, which is supplied by the <em>Vulg</em>. , <em>Syr</em>. , and the <em>Targ</em>. ; and it is rendered necessary by the tense of the verb. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
