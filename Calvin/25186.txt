<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_6:39</span><strong>.</strong><em>And he spake to them a parable. </em>Luke relates this saying without mentioning any occurrence, but states generally, that Christ made use of this <em>parable; </em>as in recording many of Christâ€™s discourses he says nothing as to the occasion on which they were delivered. It is no doubt possible that Christ may have spoken this parable more than once; but, as no place more appropriate was to be found, I have not hesitated to insert here what Luke relates without fixing the time. </p></div>
