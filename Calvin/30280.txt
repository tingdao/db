<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14</strong><em>When he is drawn away by his own lust. </em>As the inclination and excitement to sin are inward, in vain does the sinner seek an cause from an external impulse. At the same time these two effects of lust ought to be noticed — that it ensnares us by its allurements, and that it does us away; each of which is sufficient to render us guilty. <span class="cite-ref">(106)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(106)</span> The words are very striking, — “But every one is tempted (or, seduced) when, by his own lust, <em>he is </em>drawn away, (that is, from what is good,) and <em>is </em>caught by a bait (or, ensnared.)” </p><p>He is in the first drawn off from the line of duty, and then he is caught by something that is pleasing and plausible, but like the bait, it has in it a deadly hook. </p></div></div>
