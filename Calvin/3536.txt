<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And I will set my tabernacle among you</em>. He alludes, indeed, to the visible sanctuary in which He was worshipped; still He would shew them that it should be effectually manifested, that He had not chosen His home amongst them in vain, inasmuch as He would exert His power by sure proofs to aid and preserve them. In a word, He signifies that the sanctuary would not be an empty sign of His presence, but that the reality should correspond with the sign; and this He further confirms in the next verse, where He says that He would “walk among” them. For as yet they had not arrived at their place of rest, and therefore had need of Him as their Leader, in order that their journey might be prosperous. Although He does not say in express terms that they should be spiritually blessed, still there is no doubt but that He lifts their thoughts above the world when He promises that He would be their God; for this expression, “I will be your God,” contains, as Christ interprets it, the hope of eternal immortality; because He is the fountain of life, and “not the God of the dead.” (<span class="bvs">Mat_22:32</span>.) The true and solid felicity, then, is now promised, which was typically represented. For this reason David, although he greatly magnifies the earthly blessings of God, yet, by the conclusion which he adds, demonstrates that he did not stop short with them; </p><p>“God’s mercy (he says) shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord, to length of days.” <span class="cite-ref">(213)</span> (<span class="bvs">Psa_23:6</span>.) </p><p>And elsewhere, when he had said that they are happy, to whom God abundantly supplies all things (needful, <span class="cite-ref">(214)</span>) presently adds, as if in explanation, </p><p>“Happy is that people, whose God is the Lord.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_144:15</span>.) </p><p>Finally, He recalls to their recollection that He had been their Deliverer, that they may assuredly gather from what was past, that the flow of His grace would be continuous, if only they themselves do run the course unto which He had called them. </p><p><strong>(213)</strong> See Margin <em>A</em>. <em>V</em>. </p><p><strong>(214)</strong> Added from <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
