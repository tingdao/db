<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_13:16</span><strong>.</strong><em>But blessed are your eyes. </em>Luke appears to represent this statement as having been spoken at another time; but this is easily explained, for in that passage he throws together a variety of our Lord’s sayings, without attending to the order of dates. We shall, therefore, follow the text of Matthew, who explains more clearly the circumstances from which Christ took occasion to utter these words. Having formerly reminded them of the extraordinary favor which they had received, in being separated by our Lord from the common people, and familiarly admitted to the mysteries of his kingdom, he now magnifies that grace by another comparison, which is, that they excel ancient <em>Prophets </em>and holy <em>Kings </em>This is a far loftier distinction than to be preferred to an unbelieving multitude. Christ does not mean any kind of <em>hearing, </em>or the mere <em>beholding </em>of the flesh, but pronounces their <em>eyes </em>to be <em>blessed, </em>because they perceive in him a glory which is worthy of the only-begotten Son of God, so as to acknowledge him as the Redeemer; because they perceive shining in him the lively image of God, by which they obtain salvation and perfect happiness; and because in them is fulfilled what had been spoken by the Prophets, that those who have been truly and perfectly <em>taught by the Lord </em>(<span class="bvs">Isa_54:13</span>) do not need to <em>learn every man from his neighbor, </em>(<span class="bvs">Jer_31:34</span>.) </p><p>This furnishes a reply to an objection that might be drawn from another saying of Christ, that </p><p>blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_20:29</span>;) </p><p>for there he describes that kind of <em>seeing </em>which Thomas desired in consequence of his gross apprehension. <span class="cite-ref">(190)</span> But that <em>seeing, </em>of which Christ now speaks, has been enjoyed by believers in every age in common with the Apostles. We do not see Christ, and yet we see him; we do not hear Christ, and yet we hear him: for in the Gospel we behold him, as Paul says, </p><p>face to face, so as to be transformed into his image, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Co_3:18</span>;) </p><p>and the perfection of wisdom, righteousness, and life, which was formerly exhibited in him, shines there continually. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(190)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Selon son apprehension carnale et grossiere</span>;” — “according to his carnal and gross apprehension.” </p></div></div>
