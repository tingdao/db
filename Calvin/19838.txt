<div class="comment-content"><p>It is then added, <em>confirmed have been the words of Jonadab </em>by his children; but my people do not obey me. But as we have said in the last lecture, the Prophet touches particularly on this circumstance, — that the Rechabites obeyed the command of their father in not drinking wine: this was hard; they did <em>not drink even to that day </em>But what did God require from his children? only to receive his Law, and not to go astray, as it is here added, after alien gods. There is, then, a contrast between the hard precept of Jonadab and the equity of the Law; for God required nothing from his people <em>except </em>to render him pure worship, he says, <em>They have drunk no wine to this </em>day — and why? because they <em>obeyed; </em>that is, there was no scruple of <em>conscience </em>to prevent them, but the authority of a man who was dead so far prevailed witIt them, that they willingly gave up the use of wine. “As then simple obedience, that is, piety or respect for their father, produced such influence on the Rechabites, how is it that I am not heard? for <em>I have spoken,” </em>he says, “so that the sin of the people is not excusable on the ground of ignorance.” </p><p>Then he adds, <em>Early rising and speaking </em>Here assiduity and diligence are mentioned. Jonadab only once gave his command to his children; that command, which might have been forgotten, remained perpetually in the hearts of his sons, so that they taught the same to his grandsons. But God commanded what was right not only once, but <em>rose up early, </em>that is, he sedulously anticipated them; for by this metaphor he intimates that he did not wait until after a continued licentiousness they became more addicted to their vices; for we know that those who have for many years been without restraint, are not easily brought into order, but they become habitually refractory. And hence, also, it comes to be necessary to form those from infancy who are to be ruled by us; for if they be allowed to act as they please, their wantonness cannot afterwards be restrained by any laws. God then says, that he <em>rose up early, </em>that is, that he anticipated the Jews, so that together with their milk they might imbibe religion. </p></div>
