As there is nothing in the ordinary course of nature, throughout the whole frame of heaven and earth, which does not invite us to the contemplation of God, he might have brought forward, as in <span class="bvs">Psa_19:1</span>, the sun and the stars, and the whole host of heaven, and the earth with its riches; but he selects only those works of God which prove not only that the world was at first created by him, and is governed by his power, but which also awaken the torpid, and drag them, as it were, in spite of themselves, humbly to adore him; as even Horace was compelled, though he was not only a heathen poet, but an Epicurean, and a vile contemner of Deity, to say of himself in one of his Odes, — (Lib. I. Ode 34.) </p><p>“A fugitive from heaven and prayer, <LineBreak />I mocked at all religious fear, <LineBreak />Deep scienced in the mazy lore <LineBreak />Of mad philosophy; but now <LineBreak />Hoist sail, and back my voyage plough <LineBreak />To that blest harbour which I left before. </p><p>“For, lo! that awful heavenly Sire, <LineBreak />Who frequent cleaves the clouds with fire, <LineBreak />Parent of day, immortal Jove; <LineBreak />Late through the floating fields of air, <LineBreak />The face of heaven serene and fair, <LineBreak />His thund’ring steeds, and winged chariot drove,” etc. <span class="cite-ref">(609)</span></p><p>Experience, too, tells us that those who are most daring in their contempt of God are most afraid of thunderings, storms, and such like violent commotions. With great propriety, therefore, does the prophet invite our attention to these instances which strike the rude and insensible with some sense of the existence of a God, <span class="cite-ref">(610)</span> and rouse them to action, however sluggish and regardless they are. He says not that the sun rises from day to day, and sheds abroad his life-giving beams, nor that the rain gently descends to fertilise the earth with its moisture; but he brings forward thunders, violent tempests, and such things as smite the hearts of men with dread by their violence. God, it is true, speaks in all his creatures, but here the prophet mentions those sounds which rouse us from our drowsiness, or rather our lethargy, by the loudness of their noise. We have said, that this language is chiefly directed to those who with stubborn recklessness, cast from them, as far as they can, all thought of God. The very figures which he uses sufficiently declare, that David’s design was to subdue by fear the obstinacy which yields not willingly otherwise. Thrice he repeats that God’s voice is heard in great and violent tempests, and in the subsequent verse he adds, that it is full of power and majesty. </p><p><strong>(609)</strong><em>Dr Francis’ </em>Translation of Horace. </p><p><strong>(610)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui contraignent les barbares et gens esbestez sentir qu’il y a un Dieu</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em>“Which constrain the rude and insensible to feel that there is a God.” </p></div>
