<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of that house. </em>I have no doubt that by <em>the fatness of God’s house </em>the prophet means the abundance of good things which is not designed for all men indiscriminately, but is laid up in store for the children of God who commit themselves wholly to his protection. Some restrict the expression to spiritual graces; but to me it seems more likely, that under it are comprehended all the blessings that are necessary to the happiness and comfort of the present life, as well as those which pertain to eternal and heavenly blessedness. It ought, however, to be observed, that in the style of speaking which the prophet here employs, the use of earthly blessings is connected with the gracious experience of faith, in the exercise of which we can alone enjoy them rightfully and lawfully to our own welfare. When the ungodly glut themselves with the abundance of God’s benefits, their bodies indeed grow fat like the flesh of cattle or swine, but their souls are always empty and famished. It is the faithful alone, as I have said, who are satisfied with the goodness of God towards them, because it is to them a pledge of his fatherly love. The expression <em>meat </em>and <em>drink </em>denotes a complete and perfect fullness, and the term <em>river, </em><span class="cite-ref">(10)</span> denotes an overflowing abundance. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(10)</span> The words in the original are, <span class="lang he-il">נחל עתיך</span>, <em>nachal adanecha</em>, <em>the river of thy Eden</em>, in which there is probably an allusion to the garden of <span class="lang he-il">ערן</span> Eden, and to the river which flowed through and watered it. </p></div></div>
