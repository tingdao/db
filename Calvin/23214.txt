<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Man shall not live by bread alone. </em>He quotes the statement, that men <em>do not live by bread alone, </em>but by the secret blessing of God. Hence we conclude, that Satan made a direct attack on the faith of Christ, in the hope that, after destroying his faith, he would drive Christ to unlawful and wicked methods of procuring food. And certainly he presses us very hard, when he attempts to make us distrust God, and consult our own advantage in a way not authorized by his word. The meaning of the words, therefore, is: “When you see that you are forsaken by God, you are driven by necessity to attend to yourself. Provide then for yourself the food, with which God does not supply you.” Now, though <span class="cite-ref">(312)</span> he holds out the divine power of Christ to turn the <em>stones </em>into <em>loaves, </em>yet the single object which he has in view, is to persuade Christ to depart from the word of God, and to follow the dictates of infidelity. </p><p>Christ’s reply, therefore, is appropriate: <em>“Man shall not live by bread alone. </em>You advise me to contrive some remedy, for obtaining relief in a different manner from what God permits. This would be to distrust God; and I have no reason to expect that he will support me in a different manner from what he has promised in his word. You, Satan, represent his favor as confined to <em>bread: </em>but Himself declares, that, though every kind of food were wanting, his blessing alone is sufficient for our nourishment.” Such was the kind of temptation which Satan employed, the same kind with which he assails us daily. The Son of God did not choose to undertake any contest of an unusual description, but to sustain assaults in common with us, that we might be furnished with the same armor, and might entertain no doubt as to achieving the victory. </p><p><em>It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone. </em>The first thing to be observed here is, that Christ uses Scripture as his shield: for this is the true way of fighting, if we wish to make ourselves sure of the victory. With good reason does Paul say, that, the sword of the Spirit is the word of God,” and enjoin us to <em>“ </em>take the shield of faiths” (<span class="bvs">Eph_6:16</span>.) Hence also we conclude, that Papists, as if they had made a bargain with Satan, cruelly give up souls to be destroyed by him at his pleasure, when they wickedly withhold the Scripture from the people of God, and thus deprive them of their arms, by which alone their safety could be preserved. Those who voluntarily throw away that armor, and do not laboriously exercise themselves in the school of God, deserve to be strangled, at every instant, by Satan, into whose hands they give themselves up unarmed. No other reason can be assigned, why the fury of Satan meets with so little resistance, and why so many are everywhere carried away by him, but that God punishes their carelessness, and their contempt of his word. </p><p>We must now examine more closely the passage, which is quoted by Christ from Moses: <em>that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live, </em>(<span class="bvs">Deu_8:3</span>.) There are some who torture it to a false meaning, as referring to spiritual life; as if our Lord had said, that souls are not nourished by visible <em>bread, but by the word of God. </em>The statement itself is, no doubt, true: but Moses had quite a different meaning. He reminds them that, when no bread could be obtained, God provided them with an extraordinary kind of nourishment in “manna, which they knew not, neither did their fathers know,” (<span class="bvs">Deu_8:3</span>;) and that this was intended as an evident proof, in all time coming, that the life of man is not confined to <em>bread, </em>but depends on the will and good-pleasure of God. <em>The word </em>does not mean <em>doctrine, </em>but the purpose which God has made known, with regard to preserving the order of nature and the lives of his creatures. Having created men, he does not cease to care for them: but, as “he breathed into their nostrils the breath of life,” (<span class="bvs">Gen_2:7</span>,) so he constantly preserves the life which he has bestowed. In like manner, the Apostle says, that he “upholdeth all things by his powerful word,” (<span class="bvs">Heb_1:3</span>;) that is, the whole world is preserved, and every part of it keeps its place, by the will and decree of Him, whose power, above and below, is everywhere diffused. Though we live on <em>bread, </em>we must not ascribe the support of life to the power of <em>bread, </em>but to the secret kindness, by which God imparts to bread the quality of nourishing our bodies. </p><p>Hence, also, follows another statement: <em>by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God shall men live. </em>God, who now employs bread for our support, will enable us, whenever he pleases, to live by other means. This declaration of Moses condemns the stupidity of those, who reckon life to consist in luxury and abundance; while it reproves the distrust and inordinate anxiety which drives us to seek unlawful means. The precise object of Christ’s reply is this: We ought to trust in God for food, and for the other necessaries of the present life, in such a manner, that none of us may overleap the boundaries which he has prescribed. But if Christ did not consider himself to be at liberty to change <em>stones </em>into <em>bread, </em>without the command of God, much less is it lawful for us to procure food by fraud, or robbery, or violence, or murder. </p><p><strong>(312)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien que pour couvrir sa malice</span>;” — “though, to cover his malice.” </p></div>
