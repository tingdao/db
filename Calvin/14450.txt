<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Let not the foot of pride come upon me </em>As I have observed a little before, the Psalmist here applies to his own circumstances the prayer which he had offered. But by including in his prayer in the preceding verse all the children of God, he designed to show that he asked nothing for himself apart from others, but only desired that as one of the godly and upright, who have their eyes directed to God, he might enjoy his favor. He has employed the expressions, <em>the foot of pride, </em><span class="cite-ref">(12)</span> and <em>the hand of the wicked, </em>in the same sense. As the wicked rush boldly to the destruction of good men, lifting up their feet to tread upon them, and having their hands ready to do them wrong, David entreats God to restrain their hands and their feet; and thus he confesses that he is in danger of being exposed to their insolence, abuse, and violence, unless God come speedily to his aid. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(12)</span> That is, the foot of the proud man, as the Chaldee translates it, the thing being put for the person in whom it is; a mode of expression of frequent occurrence in Scripture. Thus <em>deceit</em>, in <span class="bvs">Pro_12:27</span>, is put for <em>a deceitful man</em>; <em>poverty</em>, in <span class="bvs">2Kg_24:14</span>, <em>for poor people</em>, etc. There appears to be here an allusion to the ancient practice of tyrants in treading upon their enemies, or in spurning those who offended them from their presence with their feet. </p></div></div>
