<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>He went down to Capernaum. </em>The Evangelist passes to an additional narrative; for having resolved to collect a few things worthy of remembrance which the other three had left out, he states the time when the occurrence which he is about to relate took place; for the other three also relate what we here read that Christ did, but the diversity of the time shows that it was a similar event, but not the same. On two occasions, then, did Christ cleanse the temple from base and profane merchandise; once, when he was beginning to discharge his commission, and another time, (<span class="bvs">Mat_21:12</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_11:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_19:45</span>,) when he was about to <em>leave the world and go to the Father</em>, (<span class="bvs">Joh_16:28</span>.) </p><p>To obtain a general view of the passage, it will be necessary briefly to examine the details in their order. That <em>oxen, and sheep, and doves, </em>were exposed to sale<em>in the temple</em>, and that <em>money-changers </em>were sitting there, was not without a plausible excuse. For they might allege that the <em>merchandise </em>transacted there was not irreligious, but, on the contrary, related to the sacred worship of God, that every person might obtain, without difficulty, what he might offer to the Lord; and, certainly, it was exceedingly convenient for godly persons to find oblations of any sort laid ready to their hand, and in this way to be freed from the trouble of running about in various directions to obtain them. We are apt to wonder, therefore, why Christ was so highly displeased with it. But there are two reasons which deserve our attention. First, as the Priests abused this <em>merchandise </em>for their own gain and avarice, such a mockery of God could not be endured. Secondly, whatever excuse men may plead, as soon as they depart, however slightly, from the command of God, they deserve reproof and need correction. And this is the chief reason why Christ undertook to purify <em>the temple</em>; for he distinctly states that <em>the temple of God is not a place of merchandise </em></p><p>But it may be asked, Why did he not rather begin with doctrine? For it seems to be a disorderly and improper method to apply the hand for correcting faults, before the remedy of doctrine has been applied. But Christ had a different object in view: for the time being now at hand when he would publicly discharge the office assigned to him by the Father, he wished in some way to take possession of the temple, and to give a proof of his divine authority. And that all might be attentive to his doctrine, it was necessary that something new and strange should be done to awaken their sluggish and drowsy minds. Now,<em>the temple </em>was a sanctuary of heavenly doctrine and of true religion. Since he wished to restore purity of doctrine, it was of great importance that he should prove himself to be the Lord of the temple. Besides, there was no other way in which he could bring back sacrifices and the other exercises of religion to their spiritual design than by removing the abuse of them. What he did at that time was, therefore, a sort of preface to that reformation which the Father had sent him to accomplish. In a word, it was proper that the Jews should be aroused by this example to expect from Christ something that was unusual and out of the ordinary course; and it was also necessary to remind them that the worship of God had been corrupted and perverted, that they might not object to the reformation of those abuses </p><p><em>And his brethren. </em>Why the <em>brethren </em>of Christ accompanied him, cannot be determined with certainty, unless, perhaps, they intended to go along with him to Jerusalem. The word <em>brethren</em>, it is well known, is employed, in the Hebrew language, to denote cousins and other relatives. </p></div>
