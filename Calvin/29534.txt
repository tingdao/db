<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17</strong><em>. And whatsoever ye do. </em>We have already explained these things, and what goes before, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, where the same things are said almost word for word. As he had already begun to discourse in reference to different parts of the Christian life, and had simply touched upon a few precepts, it would have been too tedious a thing to follow out the rest one by one, he therefore concludes in a summary way, that life must be regulated in such a manner, that whatever we say or do may be wholly governed by the authority of Christ, and may have an eye to his glory as the mark. <span class="cite-ref">(454)</span> For we shall fitly comprehend under this term the two following things — that all our aims <span class="cite-ref">(455)</span> may set out with invocation of Christ, and may be subservient to his glory. From invocation follows the act of blessing God, which supplies us with matter of thanksgiving. It is also to be observed, that he teaches that we must give thanks to the Father <em>through Christ</em>, as we obtain through him every good thing that God confers upon us. </p><p><strong>(454)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme a son but principal</span>;” — “As to its chief aim.” </p><p><strong>(455)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Toutes nos œuures et entreprinses</span>;” — “All our works and enterprises.” </p></div>
