<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And they shall call you a holy people. </em>He describes the benefit of the coming of the Lord; that is, because, by shewing that he takes care of his elect as his heritage, he will make it evident to the whole world that the covenant of adoption, which he made with Abraham, was not deceptive. He therefore calls them “a holy people,” because the Lord hath separated and consecrated them to himself; for, although he governs all nations, he has deigned to choose the seed of Abraham, that he might make them the object of his peculiar care. (<span class="bvs">Exo_19:6</span>.) </p><p><em>The redeemed of Jehovah</em>. In the sense now stated, God declares that they shall be a holy people, when he shall appear as their Savior and Redeemer; for, as the people are said to be “profaned” when they lie amidst filth, being afflicted and distressed by the reproaches of the wicked, so they are said to be “sanctified,” when the Lord actually shews that he presides over their salvation. This was accomplished by a wonderful redemption; and at that time God also testified that he remembered his heritage, which, in the eyes of men, he appeared to have forsaken and disregarded; for in these words, Sought out, <span class="cite-ref">(172)</span> not forsaken, is denoted a contrast between the time when God made a divorce from his people, and the time when he again reconciled to himself those whom he had cast off. </p><p><strong>(172)</strong> “The word <span class="lang he-il">דרושה</span>, <em>(derushah,) </em>the name that shall be given to Jerusalem, is rendered by some <em>sought after, </em>that is, a city to which, as being very highly celebrated and visited by crowds of strangers, all shall resort and shall desire to be enrolled among her citizens. Others render it <em>cared for, </em>that is, by Jehovah, who appeared to have abandoned and given her up to forgetfulness, as her citizens complained. (<span class="bvs">Isa_49:14</span>.) Both agree with what is here added, ‘A city not forsaken.’ (See <span class="bvs">Jer_30:14</span>.)” —<em>Rosenmuller. </em></p></div>
