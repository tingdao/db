<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>God therefore gave them up, etc. </em>As impiety is a hidden evil, lest they should still find an evasion, he shows, by a more palpable demonstration, that, they cannot escape, but must be held fast by a just condemnation, since such fruits have followed this impiety as cannot be viewed otherwise than manifest evidences of the Lord’s wrath. As the Lord’s wrath is always just, it follows, that what has exposed them to condemnation, must have preceded it. By these evidences then he now proves the apostasy and defection of men: for the Lord indeed does so punish those, who alienate themselves from his goodness, that he casts them headlong into various courses which lead to perdition and ruin. And by comparing the vices, of which they were guilty, with the impiety, of which he had before accused them, he shows that they suffered punishment through the just judgment of God: for since nothing is dearer to us than our own honor, it is extreme blindness, when we fear not to bring disgrace on ourselves; and it is the most suitable punishment for a reproach done to the Divine Majesty. This is the very thing which he treats of to the end of the chapter; but he handles it in various ways, for the subject required ample illustration. </p><p>What then, in short, he proves to us is this, — that the ingratitude of men to God is incapable of being excused; for it is manifest, by unequivocal evidences, that the wrath of God rages against them: they would have never rolled themselves in lusts so filthy, after the manner of beasts, had not the majesty of God been provoked and incensed against them. Since, then, the worst abominations abounded everywhere, he concludes that there existed among them evidences of divine vengeance. Now, as this never rages without reason, or unjustly, but ever keeps within the limits of what is right, he intimates that it hence appears that perdition, not less certain than just, impended over all. </p><p>As to the manner in which God gives up or delivers men to wickedness, it is by no means necessary in this place to discuss a question so intricate, (<em>longam </em> — tedious.) It is indeed certain, that he not only permits men to fall into sin, by allowing them to do so, and by conniving at them; but that he also, by his equitable judgment, so arranges things, that they are led and carried into such madness by their own lusts, as well as by the devil. He therefore adopts the word, <em>give up</em>, according to the constant usage of Scripture; which word they forcibly wrest, who think that we are led into sin only by the permission of God: for as Satan is the minister of God’s wrath, and as it were the executioner, so he is armed against us, not through the connivance, but by the command of his judge. God, however, is not on this account cruel, nor are we innocent, inasmuch as Paul plainly shows, that we are not delivered up into his power, except when we deserve such a punishment. Only we must make this exception, that the cause of sin is not from God, the roots of which ever abide in the sinner himself; for this must be true, </p><p>“Thine is perdition, O Israel; in me only is thy help.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Hos_13:9</span>) <span class="cite-ref">(51)</span></p><p>By connecting the <em>desires or lusts </em>of man’s heart with uncleanness, he indirectly intimates what sort of progeny our heart generates, when left to itself. The expression, <em>among themselves, </em>is not without its force; for it significantly expresses how deep and indelible are the marks of infamy imprinted on our bodies. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(51)</span> On this subject [<span class="bvs">Augustine </span>], as quoted by [<span class="bvs">Poole </span>], uses a stronger language than which we find here: — <em>Tradidit non solum per patientiam et permissionem, sed per potentiam et quasi actionem; non faciendo voluntates malas, sed eis jam malis utendo ut voluerit; multa et intra ipsos et exrtra ipsos operando, a quibus illi occasionem capiunt gravius peccandi; largiendo illis admonitiones, flagella, beneficia, etc., quibus quoque eos scivit Deus ad suam perniciem abusuros </em> — “He delivered them up, not only by sufferance and permission, but by power, and as it were by an efficient operation; not by making evil their wills, but by using them, being already evil, as he pleased; by working many things both within and without them, from which they take occasion to sin more grievously, by giving them warnings, scourges, benefits, etc., which God knew they would abuse to their own destruction.” — This is an awful view of God’s proceedings towards those who willfully resist the truth, but no doubt a true one. Let all who have the opportunity of knowing the truth tremble at the thought of making light of it. </p><p>The preposition<span class="lang el-gr">ἐν </span> before <em>desires </em>or lusts, is used after the Hebrew manner, in the sense of <em>to </em>or <em>into; </em>for <span class="lang he-il">ב</span><em>beth</em>, means <em>in</em>, and <em>to</em>, and also <em>by </em>or <em>through; </em>and such is the import of<span class="lang el-gr">ἐν </span> as frequently used by the Apostle. It is so used in the preceding verse<span class="lang el-gr">— ἐν ὁμοιώματι </span> — into the likeness, etc. Then the verse would be, as Calvin in sense renders it, — </p><p>God also on this account delivered them up to the lusts of their own hearts to work uncleanness, that they might dishonor their bodies among themselves. </p><p>The import of<span class="lang el-gr">εἰς ἀκαθαρσίαν, </span> in order to uncleanness, is no doubt, to work uncleanness; the Apostle frequently uses this kind of expression. [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] labors here unnecessarily to show, that God gave them up, <em>being </em>in their lusts, etc., taking the clause as a description of those who were given up; but the plainest meaning is that which Calvin gives. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
