<div class="comment-content"><p>With regard to the seventh verse, <span class="cite-ref">(161)</span> we may learn from it what I have already referred to, — that the Jews made funeral feasts, that children and widows might receive some relief to their sorrow; for the Prophet calls it the <em>cup of consolations, </em>when friends kindly attended; they had also some ridiculous gesticulations; for no doubt laughter was often excited by mourners among the Jews. But we see that men vied with one another in lamenting for the dead; for it was deemed a shame not to shew grief at the death of their friends. When tears did not flow, when the nearest relations did not howl for the dead, they thought them inhuman; hence it was, that there was much dissimulation in their mourning; and it was foolishly regarded an alleviation to extend the cup of consolation. But as I have said before, the Prophet here did not point out what was right, but borrowed his words from what was commonly practiced. It follows — </p><p><strong>(161)</strong><em>Calvin, </em>having in his version explained the beginning of this verse, passes it by here. His rendering is, “And they shall not beat their hands together for them, to console <em>any one </em>for the dead.” He omits one word, rendered, “in mourning” in our version. The <em>Septuagint, </em>the <em>Vulgate, </em>the <em>Arabic </em>and the <em>Targum </em>give another meaning. They must have read <span class="lang he-il">לחם</span> “bread,” instead of <span class="lang he-il">להם</span> “for them.” The difference is so small that we are inclined to think it the true readIng, though there be but two MSS. in its favor. The passage itself seems to require this reading, — the verb which precedes it, and the correspondence between the former and latter part of the verse — bread and drink. The verse then would read thus, — </p><p><strong>7.</strong>And they shall not divide bread to the mourner, To console him for the dead: Nor shall they give them to drink the cup of consolations, <em>Each one </em>for his father and for his mother. </p><p><em>Blayney </em>quotes Jerome, who says, “It was usual to carry provisions to mourners, and to make an entertainment, which sort of feasts the Greeks call <span class="lang el-gr">περιδειπνα</span>, and the Latin <em>parentalia </em><em>.” </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
