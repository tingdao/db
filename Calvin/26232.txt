<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>For as the Father raiseth up the dead. </em>Here he gives a summary view of the nature of the office which had been given to him by the Father; for though he appears to specify one class, yet it is a general doctrine in which he declares himself to be the Author of <em>life </em>Now <em>life </em>contains within itself not only righteousness, but all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and every part of our salvation. And certainly this miracle must have been so remarkable a proof of the power of Christ, as to yield this common fruit; that is, to open a door to the Gospel. We ought also to observe in what manner Christ bestows <em>life </em>upon us; for he found us all dead, and therefore it was necessary to begin with a <em>resurrection </em>Yet, when he joins the two words, <em>raiseth up </em>and <em>quickeneth, </em>he does not use superfluous language; for it would not have been enough that we were rescued from death, if Christ did not fully and perfectly restore <em>life </em>to us. Again, he does not speak of this life as bestowed indiscriminately on all; for he says that <em>he giveth life to whom he will</em>; by which he means that he specially confers this grace on none but certain men, that is, on the elect. </p></div>
