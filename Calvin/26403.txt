<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Will he kill himself? </em>The scribes persevere not only in fearless scorn, but likewise in effrontery; for they ridicule what he had said, that <em>they cannot follow whither he shall go</em>; as if they had said, “If he <em>kill himself</em>, we acknowledge that we cannot accompany him, because we do not choose to do so.” They regarded Christ’s absence as a matter of no moment, and thought that in all respects they would gain a victory over him; and so they bid him begone wherever he pleases. Shocking stupidity! But thus does Satan infatuate the reprobate, that, intoxicated with more than brutal indifference, <span class="cite-ref">(222)</span> they may throw themselves into the midst of the flame of the wrath of God. Do we not in the present day behold the same rage in many who, having stupified their consciences, insolently play off their jests and buffoonery on every thing that they hear about the dreadful judgment of God? Yet it is certain that this is an affected or sardonic smile, for they are pierced inwardly with unseen wounds; but all on a sudden, like men bereft of their senses, they burst out into furious laughter. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(222)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Enyvrez d’une stupidite plus que brutale</span>.” </p></div></div>
