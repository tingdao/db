<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_5:36</span><strong>.</strong><em>Fear not, only believe. </em>The message about her death had induced despair: for he had asked nothing from Christ but relief to the diseased young woman. Christ therefore bids him take care lest, by fear or distrust, he shut out that grace, to which death will be no hindrance. By this expression, <em>only believe, </em>he means that he will not want power, provided Jairus will allow him; and, at the same time, exhorts him to enlarge his heart with confidence, because there is no room to fear that his faith will be more extensive than the boundless power of God. And truly this is the case with us all: for God would be much more liberal in his communications to us, if we were not so close; but our own scanty desires hinder him from pouring out his gifts upon us in greater abundance. <span class="cite-ref">(528)</span> In general, we are taught by this passage, that we cannot go beyond bounds in believing: because our faith, however large, will never embrace the hundredth part of the divine goodness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(528)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais la petitesse, et (par maniere de dire) la chicete de nostre foy, l'empesche de faire decouler plus abondamment ses biens sur nous</span>;” — “But the smallness and (so to speak) the niggardliness of our faith, hinders him from making his benefits flow more abundantly on us.” </p></div></div>
