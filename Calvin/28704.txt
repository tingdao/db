He speaks, however, in the first place of edification in this way: “Let every one, according as he has been endowed with some particular gift, make it his aim to lay it out for the advantage of all.” For it is in this way that we must understand the word rendered <em>every one </em>— <em>that </em>no one may take it as implying universality, as though all to a man were endowed with some such gift. </p></div>
