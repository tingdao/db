<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Thus striving to preach the gospel, etc. </em>As it was necessary for Paul not only to prove himself to be the servant of Christ and a pastor of the Christian Church, but also to show his title to the character and office of an Apostle, that he might gain the attention of the Romans, he mentions here the proper and peculiar distinction of the apostleship; for the work of an Apostle is to propagate the gospel where it had not been preached, according to that command, </p><p>“Go ye, preach the gospel to every creature.” (<span class="bvs">Mar_16:15</span>.) </p><p>And this is what we ought carefully to notice, lest we make a general rule of what specially belongs to the Apostolic order: nor ought we to consider it a fault, that a successor was substituted who built up the Church. The Apostles then were the founders as it were of the Church; the pastors who succeeded them, had to strengthen and amplify the building raised up by them. <span class="cite-ref">(456)</span> He calls that <em>another’s foundation, </em>which had been laid by the hand of another: otherwise Christ is the only stone on which the Church is founded. See <span class="bvs">1Co_3:11</span>; and <span class="bvs">Eph_2:20</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(456)</span> The participle, “striving,” rendered <em>annitens </em> by [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] and by [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>], is<span class="lang el-gr">φιλοτιμούμενος, </span> which means to strive honorably: it is to seek a thing as an object of honor or ambition. It may be rendered here, “honorably striving;” [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] has, “It hath been the object of my ambition;” [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>], “I was strongly desirous;” and [<span class="bvs">Wolfius </span>], “honori mihi ducentem — esteeming it an honor to me.” It is used to express both an honorable and an earnest or diligent pursuit. It is found in two other places, teeming it an honor,” or, “Being ambitious.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
