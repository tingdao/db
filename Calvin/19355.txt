<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah introduces here nothing new, but proceeds with the subject we observed in the last verse, — that God would not deal with so much severity with the Jews, because extreme rigor was pleasing to him, or because he had forgotten his own nature or the covenant which he had made with Abraham, but because the Jews had become extremely obstinate in their wickedness. As, then, he had said that the <em>eyes </em>of God <em>were on all their ways, </em>so now he adds that he would <em>recompense </em>them as they deserved. </p><p>But every word ought to be <em>considered: </em>He says <span class="lang he-il">ראשונה</span><em>rashune, </em>which I render “From the beginning.” Some render it more obscurely, “at first,” — I will first recompense them. The word means formerly, and refers to time. The Prophet then, I have no doubt, means what I have already referred to, — that God would punish the fathers and their children, and would thus gather into one mass their old iniquities. We have quoted from the law that God would recompense unto the bosom of children the sins of their fathers; and we have also quoted that declaration of Christ, </p><p>“Come upon you shall righteous blood from Abel to Zachariah, the son of Barachiah.” (<span class="bvs">Mat_23:35</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_11:51</span>) </p><p>The Prophet now repeats the same thing, — that God, in allotting to the Jews their reward, would collect together as it were all the iniquities which had been as it were long buried, so that he would include the fathers and their children in one bundle, and gather together all their sins, in order that he might consume them as it were in one heap. In this way I explain the term “From the beginning.” <span class="cite-ref">(166)</span></p><p>He then adds, <em>The double of their iniquities and their sins </em>The Prophet does not mean that there would be an excess of severity, as though God would not rightly consider what men deserved; but “double” signifies a just and complete measure, according to what is said in <span class="bvs">Isa_40:2</span>, </p><p>“The Lord hath recompensed double for all her sins;” </p><p>that is, sufficiently and more, <em>(satis superque) </em>as the Latins say. There God assumes the character of a father, and, according to his great kindness, says that the Jews had been more than sufficiently punished. So also in this place, in speaking of punishment, he calls that double, not what would exceed the limits of justice, but because God would shew himself differently to them from what he had done before, when he patiently bore with them; as though he had said, “I will to the utmost punish them; for there will be no remission, no lenity,no mercy.” We hence see that what is here designed is only extreme rigor, which yet was just and right; for had God punished a hundred times more severely even those who seemed to have sinned lightly, his justice could not have been questioned as though he had acted cruelly. Since, the Jews, then, had in so many ways, and for so long a time, and so grievously sinned, God could not have been thought too severe, when he rendered to them their reward; and he calls it double because he omitted nothing in order to carry it to the utmost severity. Probably he alludes also to the enemies as being ministers of his vengeance, whose cruelty would be more atrocious than the Jews thought, who imagined some slight remedies for slight sins, as we say, <em>Il n’y faudra plus retourner, </em>or, <em>tote outre. </em></p><p>He mentions <em>sins and iniquities, </em>for Jeremiah had introduced them before as speaking thus, “What is our iniquity? and what is our sin?” Though they could not wholly exculpate themselves, they yet continued to allege some pretences, that they might not appear to be altogether wicked. But here God declares that they were wholly wicked and ungodly; and he adds a confirmation, that they had <em>polluted the land with the carcases of their abominations </em>The Prophet mentions a particular thing, for had he spoken generally, the Jews would have raised a clamor and said, that they were not conscious of being so wicked. That he might then bring the matter home to them, he shews as it were by the finger that their sin was by no means excusable, for they had polluted the land of God with their superstitions; they have polluted, he says, <em>my land </em>He exaggerates their crime by saying, that they polluted the holy land. The earth indeed is God’s and its fullness. (<span class="bvs">Psa_24:1</span>) Hence it might be said justly of the whole world, that the land of God is polluted when men act on it an ungodly part. But here God distinguishes Canaan from other countries, because it was dedicated as it were to his name. As God then had set apart that land for himself, that he might be there worshipped, he says, they have <em>polluted my land </em></p><p>And he adds, <em>With the carcases of their abominations </em>It is probable that he calls their sacrifices carcases. For though in appearance their superstitions bore a likeness to the true and lawful worship of God, yet we know that the sacrifices which God had commanded were seasoned by his word as with salt; they were therefore of good odor and fragrance before God. As to the sacrifices offered to idols, they were foetid carcases, they were mere rottenness, yet the ceremony was altogether alike. But God does not regard the external form, for obedience is better before him than all sacrifices. (<span class="bvs">1Sa_15:22</span>) We hence see that there is to be understood a contrast between the carcases and the sweet odor which lawful sacrifices possessed. For as sacrifices, rightly offered according to the rule of the law, pleased God and were said to be of sweet savor so the victims superstitiously offered having no command of God in their favor, were called filthy carcases. </p><p>And he says further, <em>With their defilements have they filled mine inheritance </em>The land of Canaan is called the inheritance of God in the same sense in which the land is before called his land. But in this second clause something more is expressed, as it is the usual manner of Scripture to amplify. It was indeed a grievous thing that the land dedicated to God should be polluted; but when he says, This is <em>mine inheritance, </em>that is, the, land which I have chosen to dwell in with my people, that it might be to me as it were a kind of an earthly habitation, and that this land was fined with defilements, it was a thing altogether intolerable. We now then see that the Jews were so bridled and checked that they in vain attempted to escape, or thought to gain anything by evasions, for their impiety was intolerable and deserved to be most severely punished by God. I will not proceed further, for it is a new discourse. </p><p><strong>(166)</strong> The <em>Septuagint </em>omit this word, and give this rendering, “And I will recompense their twofold iniquities,” etc., so does the <em>Vulgate</em>, only it retains this word, and renders it “first.” But the Hebrew will not admit the connection of “two-fold” with “iniquities.” </p><p><em>Venema </em>gives the best exposition of this passage, from <span class="bvs">Jer_16:14</span> to the end, he considers it a prophecy of the restoration of the people from Babylon. The “fishers” and “the hunters,” in <span class="bvs">Jer_16:16</span>, he regards as the indibviduals employed by God to gather them from the countries to which they had been dispersed, suych as Zerubbabel, Joshuah, Ezra, and Nehemiah. He connects this verse more especially with the latter part of <span class="bvs">Jer_16:17</span>. Having stated that their ways would not be hid from God in their dispersion, the Prophet refers to their previous iniquity as having not been hid from them, and then says in God’s name, “And I will first recompense doubly their iniquity,” etc., that is before I restore them. These two verses may be thus rendered, the first line being connected with the previous verse, — </p><p><strong>17.</strong>For mine eyes <em>shall be </em>on all their ways. Concealed have they not been from me, Nor hid has been their iniquity from my eyes; </p><p><strong>18.</strong>And I will first doubly recompense Their iniquity and their sin, Because they have polluted my land With the vileness of their detestable things, And with their abominations have fined mine inheritance. </p><p>As the previous verse is in the future tense, so the first line in <span class="bvs">Jer_16:17</span>. The “detestable things” were their idols. The version of the <em>Septuagint </em>is, “with the dead bodies (<span class="lang el-gr">θνησιμαίοις</span>) of their abominations;” of the <em>Vulgate, </em>“with the carrions (morticinis) of their idols;” and of the <em>Syriac, </em>“with the sacrifices of their idols.” <em>Blayney’s </em>rendering is, “by the vileness of their odious practices.” The word “carcases” is derived from the <em>Targum. </em>Idolatrous practices are evidently the things referred to. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
