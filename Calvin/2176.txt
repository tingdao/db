<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>And I will set thy bounds. </em>There is no question that He confirms here the covenant which he had made with Abraham in somewhat different words. More briefly had it been said to Abraham, </p><p>“Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.” (<span class="bvs">Gen_15:18</span>.) </p><p>Here the four cardinal points of the compass are enumerated, and, instead of the Nile, the other sea is mentioned, which is opposite to the sea of Tarshish. <span class="cite-ref">(271)</span> Nor is it anything new which the Israelites are commanded to expect; but they are reminded of what they had heard of by tradition even from the time of Abraham. Hence what I have already said is more clearly perceived, viz., that the ancient covenant is set before them, in order that they may respond to God’s gratuitous favor, and on their part honor and worship Him, who had already anticipated them with His mercy. Furthermore, when they had robbed themselves of this blessing, God applied a remedy to their iniquity, by raising up a new condition of things under David, to whom this promise is repeated, as is seen in <span class="bvs">Psa_72:0</span> Therefore, although even up to that time their inheritance was in a measure incomplete <em>(truncata), </em><span class="cite-ref">(272)</span> yet, under this renovated condition, they reached its full and solid enjoyment. But since that prosperity and extension of the kingdom was not lasting, but after Solomon’s death began to fail, and at last its dignity was destroyed; therefore Zechariah uses the same words in declaring its ultimate and perfect restoration. (<span class="bvs">Zec_9:10</span>.) Thence we gather that by the coming of Christ this prophecy at length obtained its perfect accomplishment; not that the race of Abraham then began to bear rule within the bounds here laid down, but inasmuch as Christ embraced the four quarters of the globe under His dominion, from the east even to the west, and from the north even to the south. Meanwhile the power of David was the prototype of this boundless reign, when he acquired the sovereignty of the promised land. We ought not to think it unreasonable that the ancient people should be kept out of some portion of that inheritance which was to be expected by them in accordance with the covenant; but rather does God’s incredible goodness display itself, in that, when they had altogether disinherited themselves, He still combated their iniquity, and failed not to shew practically His faithfulness. We may see the same thing in the calling of the Gentiles; for, if the Jews had continued faithful, the Gentiles would have been joined with them, as it had been said, </p><p>“In those days it shall come to pass that ten men shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,” (<span class="bvs">Zec_8:23</span>;) </p><p>but their rebellion brought it about, that God only gathered from among them the first-fruits of His Church, and afterwards the Gentiles were substituted in the place which they had left empty. In this way neither did this people retain their right of primogeniture, neither did God’s truth cease to stand firm, as Paul more fully explains in the eleventh chapter of Romans. </p><p><strong>(271)</strong> Corn. a Lapide thus explains these boundaries, — “God here gives the boundaries of the promised land with respect to the cardinal points; for it has the Red Sea as its southern limit; on the west, the sea of the Palestini, or the Mediterranean, whose shores are inhabited by the Philistines; (whence Scripture often speaks of ‘the Sea’ to express the west;) on the east, it has the Arabian Desert, lying between it and Egypt; and, finally, to the north it has the River Euphrates, which is called <em>par excellence </em>(autonomasian) the River.” </p><p><strong>(272)</strong> “Quand Dieu a establi son Eglise;” when God established His (Church. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
