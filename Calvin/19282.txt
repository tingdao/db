<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet shews here more fully what we have stated, — that so refractory was the temper of those with whom he had to do, that it was necessary to use various means to subdue them. And it was not in vain that he added this exhortation, which manifests indignation; nor was it without displeasure that he required a hearing, <em>Hear ye, and give ear; be not lifted up, for the Lord is he who speaks </em>Then we may hence gather, either that Jeremiah was derided, or that his words were disregarded by the Jews; for this is intimated by the words, <em>For Jehovah has spoken; </em><span class="cite-ref">(81)</span> for were they of themselves persuaded, that he announced what God had commanded him, these words would have been used to no purpose. But we shall elsewhere see, that he was deemed an impostor, and that he was assailed by many reproofs and curses. </p><p>He therefore defends here his calling from their calumnies and reproaches, when he says, that God had spoken; for by these words he affirms that he brought nothing of his own, but spoke as it were from the mouth of God, or, which is the same thing, that he was the instrument of the Holy Spirit; and he said this, in order that they might know that they in vain contended with him, as the contest was between them and God. And on this account he says, <em>Hear ye, and give ear; </em>for he saw that they were deaf and torpid, and had need of many stimulants. He at the same time points out the cause and the source of evil by saying, <em>Be ye not lifted up </em><span class="cite-ref">(82)</span> The cause then of their contumacy was pride, for they dared to quarrel with God. So also the main principle of obedience is humility, that is, when men acknowledge that they are nothing and ascribe to God what is due to him. </p><p><strong>(81)</strong> This may be rendered more consistently with the context, “For Jehovah speaks,” or <em>is </em>speaking: for the <em>reference </em>evidently is to what was now addressed to them. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(82)</strong> So all the versions and the <em>Targum. Gataker </em>renders it, “Be ye not haughty,” which is no doubt the meaning. The verb means to be high, lofty, or elevated, and so to be elevated as to be haughty, proud. See <span class="bvs">Isa_3:16</span>. Men, creatures of the dust, too high and elevated to hear what God said to them! This is the case still. What a monstrous thing! — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
