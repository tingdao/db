<div class="comment-content"><p>He now adds, <em>My judgments are changed </em>concerning the word <span class="lang he-il">מרה</span>, <em>mereh</em>, I said that it signifies sometimes to change, but oftener to transgress or to reject, and there the sense suits very well, because the Jews were rebellious against the judgments of God even to impiety. But he enlarges upon their wickedness when he says, my <em>statutes have been despised </em>since they so addicted themselves to impiety. For if there had been any pretext of virtue, their fault might have been extenuated, but when they cast themselves into gross impiety, and thus despise God’s commandments, this is inexcusable. Let us learn from this passage, that unless we use God’s blessings with purity the charge of ingratitude will always lie against us: for whatever God bestows upon us, he sanctifies as well to our salvation as to the glory of his name. We are then sacrilegious when we corrupt those things which were destined for his glory; then are we utterly perverse when we convert to our destruction what God has appointed for our salvation. Now we must consider the ingratitude of Jerusalem as flagrant, <em>because they rejected the commandments of God. </em>When therefore God deposits among us the treasure of celestial doctrine, we must diligently take care that we do not turn aside to impiety, because there is no excuse for error when once we have been taught what is right, and that from the mouth of God himself. Then he declares the same sentiment in other words, and says, <em>beyond all nations and all lands which were round about; </em>by which sentence he signifies that the Jews; were worse than all the rest, because knowingly and willingly they had shaken off God’s yoke. Other nations had not conducted themselves better, for we know that the worship of God was then everywhere vitiated: but the impiety of the elect people was fouler, for they turned light into darkness, while the Gentiles wandered in darkness for they were blind, but the conduct of this people was different whom God had familiarly instructed. Since therefore the teaching of the law was conspicuous among the Jews, the Prophet deservedly says, <em>that they were impious beyond all nations and countries </em>Then he explains how they had either changed the judgment of God, or were themselves rebellious, <em>because they had despised, </em>says he, my <em>judgments, and had not walked in my statutes </em>First, he says, they had not fallen through ignorance but through pride and contempt; for when the will of God is made known to us, there is no place for ignorance. <em>We </em>do not sin lightly therefore, but our minds are necessarily infected with pride and contempt of God. Now he adds, <em>that they did not walk in his precepts, </em>by which words he signifies that the contempt just mentioned appeared openly, because in truth the fruit showed itself in their whole life. It follows — </p></div>
