Yet he does not recount them all, but contents himself with a few of the most remarkable instances, viz., that their clothes had not been worn out by age, and that they had been fed from heaven, when no sustenance was to be obtained from the fruits of the earth. He reminds them that Godâ€™s glory had been manifested by these testimonies, in order that they might submit themselves to His rule. </p></div>
