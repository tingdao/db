<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>For which cause, watch. </em>Paul doth again exhort them unto diligence by his own example, though he doth join therewithal fear of danger, as if he should say that they have need of great attention to beware; and that it is an unseemly thing that they should be wearied who had seen his singular<span class="cite-ref">(442)</span> patience by the space of three years. Also, he speaketh of his tears, which did add no small efficacy to his exhortations. Whereas he saith that he admonished every one, it may be referred as well unto the common people as unto the elders. For because he was determined to speak such things as should be common to the whole Church, he speaketh as if the whole body were present. Nevertheless, if any had rather restrain it unto the order of the pastors, the meaning shall be this, that their studies must be kindled, not only with this speech which he now maketh, but that it is meet that they remember those often exhortations which he did continually beat in<span class="cite-ref">(443)</span> by the space of three years, and that with many tears. Yet it seemeth to me to be more likely that he speaketh of all in general.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(442)</span></p><p>“ Infractam,” unbroken. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(443)</span></p><p>“ Assidue inculcaverat,” had assiduously inculcated. </p></div></div>
