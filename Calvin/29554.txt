<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>Always striving. </em>Here we have an example of a good pastor, whom distance of place cannot induce to forget the Church, so as to prevent him from taking the care of it with him beyond the sea. We must notice, also, the strength of entreaty that is expressed in the word <em>striving</em>. For although the Apostle had it in view here to express intensity of affection, he at the same time admonishes the Colossians not to look upon the prayers of their pastor as useless, but, on the contrary, to reckon that they would afford them no small assistance. Lastly, let us infer from Paulâ€™s words, that the <em>perfection </em>of Christians is, when they <em>stand complete in the will of God</em>, that they may not suspend their scheme of life upon anything else. </p></div>
