<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>What sign doest thou? </em>This wickedness abundantly proves how truly it is said elsewhere, <em>This wicked generation seeketh a sign</em>, (<span class="bvs">Mat_12:39</span>.) They had been at first drawn to Christ by the admiration of his miracles or <em>signs, </em>and afterwards, through amazement at a new <em>sign, </em>they acknowledged Christ to be the Messiah, and, with that conviction, <em>wished to make him a king</em>; but now they demand <em>a sign </em>from him, as if he were a man unknown to them. Whence came such sudden forgetfulness, but because they are ungrateful to God, and, through their own malice, are blind to his power, which is before their eyes? Nor can it be doubted that they treat disdainfully all the miracles which they had already beheld, because Christ does not comply with their wishes, and because they do not find him to be what they imagined him to be. If he had given them expectation of earthly happiness, he would have been highly applauded by them; they would undoubtedly have hailed him as a Prophet, and the Messiah, and the Son of God; but now, because he blames them for being too much addicted to the flesh, they think that they ought not to listen to him any more. And in the present day, how many are there who resemble them! At first, because they promise to themselves that Christ will flatter their vices, they eagerly embrace the gospel, and call for no proof of it; but when they are called to deny the flesh and to bear the cross, then do they begin to renounce Christ and ask whence the gospel came. In short, as soon as Christ does not grant their prayers, he is no longer their Master. </p></div>
