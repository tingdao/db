<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever. </em>He assigns the reason why he perseveres in singing the Divine praises in the midst of adversities; which is, that he does not despair of the manifestation of God’s loving-kindness towards his people, although at present they were under severe chastisement. Never will a man freely open his mouth to praise God, unless he is fully persuaded that God, even when he is angry with his people, never lays aside his fatherly affection towards them. The words <em>I have said, </em>imply that the truth which the inspired writer propounds was deeply fixed in his heart. <span class="cite-ref">(523)</span> Whatever, as if he had said, has hitherto happened, it has never had the effect of effacing from my heart the undoubted hope of experiencing the Divine favor as to the future, and I will always continue steadfastly to cherish the same feeling. It is to be observed, that it was not without a painful and arduous conflict that he succeeded in embracing by faith the goodness of God, which at that time had entirely vanished out of sight; — this we say is to be particularly noticed, in order that when God at any time withdraws from us all the tokens of his love, we may nevertheless learn to erect in our hearts <em>that everlasting building of mercy, </em>which is here spoken of, — a metaphor, by which is meant that the Divine mercy shall be extended, or shall continue till it reach its end or consummation. In the second clause of the verse something must be supplied. The sense, in short, is, that the Divine promise is no less stable than the settled course of the heavens, which is eternal and exempt from all change. By the word <em>heavens </em>I understand not only the visible skies, but the heavens which are above the whole frame of the world; for the truth of God, in the heavenly glory of his kingdom, is placed above all the elements of the world. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(523)</span> “Ex tristi ruinae spectaculo.” — <em>Lat</em>. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Voyant ce commoncement pitoyable d’une ruine</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
