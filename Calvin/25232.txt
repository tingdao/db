<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>And one of the Pharisees requested him. </em>This narrative shows the captious disposition, not only to take, but to seek out, offenses, which was manifested by those who did not know the office of Christ. A <em>Pharisee </em>invites Christ; from which we infer, that he was not one of those who furiously and violently opposed, nor of those who haughtily despised his doctrine. But whatever might be his mildness, he is presently offended when he sees Christ bestow a gracious reception on a woman who, in his opinion, ought not to have been permitted to approach or to converse with him; and, accordingly, disowns him as <em>a prophet, </em>because he does not acknowledge him to be the Mediator, whose peculiar office it was to bring miserable sinners into a state of reconciliation with God. It was something, no doubt, to bestow on Christ the honor due to a prophet; but he ought also to have inquired for what purpose he was sent, what he brought, and what commission he had received from the Father. Overlooking the grace of reconciliation, which was the main feature to be looked for in Christ, the Pharisee concluded that he was <em>not a prophet </em>And, certainly, had it not been that through the grace of Christ this woman had obtained the forgiveness of her sins, and a new righteousness, she ought to have been rejected. </p><p>Simon’s mistake lies only in this: Not considering that Christ came to save what was lost, he rashly concludes that Christ does not distinguish between the worthy and the unworthy. That we may not share in this dislike, let us learn, first, that Christ was given as a Deliverer to miserable and lost men, <span class="cite-ref">(239)</span> and to restore them from death to life. Secondly, let every man examine himself and his life, and then we will not wonder that others are admitted along with us, for no one will dare to place himself above others. It is hypocrisy alone that leads men to be careless about themselves, <span class="cite-ref">(240)</span> and haughtily to despise others. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(239)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Christ a este donne pour liberateur au genre humain, miserable et perdu</span>;” — “that Christ was given as a deliverer to the human race, miserable and lost.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(240)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui fait que les hommes se me cognoissent</span>;” — “which makes men forget themselves.” </p></div></div>
