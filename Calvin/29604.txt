<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>Furthermore</em>. This chapter contains various injunctions, by which he trains up the Thessalonians to a holy life, or confirms them in the exercise of it. They had previously learned what was the rule and method of a pious life: he calls this to their remembrance. <em>As</em>, says he, <em>ye have been taught</em>. Lest, however, he should seem to take away from them what he had previously assigned them, he does not simply exhort them to <em>walk </em>in such a manner, but to <em>abound more and more</em>. When, therefore, he urges them to make progress, he intimates that they are already in the way. The sum is this, that they should be more especially careful to make progress in the doctrine which they had received, and this Paul places in contrast with frivolous and vain pursuits, in which we see that a good part of the world very generally busy themselves, so that profitable and holy meditation as to the due regulation of life scarcely obtains a place, even the most inferior. Paul, accordingly, reminds them in what manner they had been instructed, and bids them aim at this with their whole might. Now, there is a law that is here enjoined upon us — that, <em>forgetting the things that are behind</em>, we always aim at farther progress, (<span class="bvs">Phi_3:13</span>) and pastors ought also to make this their endeavor. Now, as to his <em>beseeching</em>, when he might rightfully enjoin — it is a token of humanity and modesty which pastors ought to imitate, that they may, if possible, allure people to kindness, rather than violently compel them. <span class="cite-ref">(566)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(566)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que de les contraindre rudement et d’vne façon violente</span>;” — “Rather than constrain them rudely and in a violent manner.” </p></div></div>
