For he makes them the judges of this matter, provided they descend, as it were, into themselves, and acknowledge what they had received from him. In the first place, as there is but one Christ, it must be of necessity, that the same Christ must dwell alike in minister and people. Now, dwelling in the people, how will he deny himself in the minister. <span class="cite-ref">(955)</span> Farther, he had shown his power in Paul’s preaching, in such a manner that it could be no longer doubtful or obscure to the Corinthians, if they were not altogether stupid. <span class="cite-ref">(956)</span> For, whence had they faith? whence had they Christ? whence, in fine, had they every thing? It is with good reason, therefore, that they are called to look into themselves, that they may discover there, what they despise as a thing unknown. <em>Then </em>only has a minister a true and well grounded assurance for the approbation of his doctrine, when he can appeal to the consciences of those whom he has taught, that, if they have any thing of Christ, and of sincere piety, they may be constrained to acknowledge his fidelity. We are now in possession of Paul’s object. </p><p>This passage, however, is deserving of particular observation on two accounts. For, in the <em>first </em>place, it shows the relation, <span class="cite-ref">(957)</span> which subsists between the faith of the people, and the preaching of the minister — that the one is the mother, that produces and brings forth, and the other is the daughter, that ought not to forget her origin. <span class="cite-ref">(958)</span> In the <em>second </em>place, it serves to prove the assurance of faith, as to which the Sorbonnic sophists have made us stagger, nay more, have altogether rooted out from the minds of men. They charge with rashness all that are persuaded that they are the members of Christ, and have Him remaining in them, for they bid us be satisfied with a “moral conjecture,” <span class="cite-ref">(959)</span> as they call it — that is, with a mere opinion <span class="cite-ref">(960)</span> so that our consciences remain constantly in suspense, and in a state of perplexity. But what does Paul say here? He declares, that all are <em>reprobates, </em>who doubt whether they profess Christ and are a part of His body. Let us, therefore, reckon <em>that </em>alone to be right faith, which leads us to repose in safety in the favor of God, with no wavering opinion, but with a firm and steadfast assurance. </p><p><em>Unless by any means you are reprobates. </em>He gives them in a manner their choice, whether they would rather be <em>reprobates, </em>than give due testimony to his ministry; for he leaves them no alternative, but either to show <em>respect </em>to his Apostleship, or to allow that they are <em>reprobates. </em>For, unquestionably, their faith had been founded upon his doctrine, and they had no other Christ, than they had received from him, and no other gospel than what they had embraced, as delivered to them by him, so that it were vain for them to attempt to separate any part of their salvation from his praise. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(955)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">En la personne du Ministre</span>;” — “In the person of the Minister.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(956)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Du tout stupides et abbrutis</span>;” — “Altogether stupid and besotted.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(957)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">La relation et correspondance mutuelle</span>;” — “The relation and mutual correspondence.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(958)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Que ne doit point oublier le lieu d’ou elle a prins la naissance</span>;” — “Which ought not to forget the place, from which she has taken her birth.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(959)</span> See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 112. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(960)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">D’vne opinion et vn cuider</span>;” — “With an opinion and an imagination.” — The Rhemish Translators, when commenting on this <em>very </em>passage, take occasion to oppose the idea of the attainableness of assurance of faith. “The Heretiques,” say they, “argue hereupon, that every one may know himself certainly to be in grace; where the Apostle speaketh expressly and onely of faith, the act whereof a man may know and feele to be in himself, because it is an act of understanding, though he cannot be assured that he hath his sinnes remitted, and that he is in all pointes in a state of grace and salvation; because euery man that is of the Catholike faith is not alwaies of good life and agreeable thereunto, nor the acts of our will so subject to understanding, that we can knowe certainely whether we be good or euill.” Dr. Fulke, in his Refutation of the errors of the Rhemish Doctors, (Loud. 1601,) p. 584, after furnishing suitable replies to the arguments thus advanced, concludes by remarking, that “our certeintie dependeth not upon our will or workes, but upon the promise of God through faith, that Christ is in us, and we in him, therefore we shall not misse of the performance of his promises.” — Ed. </p></div></div>
