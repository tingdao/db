<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>When Jesus had said these words. </em>The more sacred the apostolic office is, and the higher its dignity, the more base and detestable was the treachery of Judas. A crime so monstrous and detestable struck Christ himself with horror, when he saw how the incredible wickedness of one man had polluted that sacred order in which the majesty of God ought to have shone with brightness. To the same purpose is what the Evangelist adds, that he <em>testified. </em>His meaning is, the action was so monstrous that the bare mention of it could not be immediately believed. </p><p><em>He was troubled in spirit. </em>The Evangelist says that Christ <em>was troubled in spirit, </em>in order to inform us that he did not merely, in countenance and language, assume the appearance of a man who was <em>troubled, </em>but that he was deeply moved in his mind. <em>Spirit </em>here denotes the understanding, or, the soul; for I do not assent to the opinion of some who explain it, as if Christ had been driven by a violent impulse of the Holy <em>Spirit </em>to break out into these words. I readily acknowledge. that all the affections of Christ were guided by the Holy <em>Spirit</em>; but the meaning of the Evangelist is different, namely, that this suffering of Christ was inward, and was not feigned; and it is of great importance for us to know this, because his zeal is held out for our imitation, that we may be moved with deep horror by those monsters which overturn the sacred order of God and of his Church. </p></div>
