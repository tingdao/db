<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong>A worthy <span class="cite-ref">(761)</span> history, which doth not only show, as it were in a glass, what end is prepared for the enemies of the Church, but also how greatly God hateth pride. The Scripture saith that “God resisteth the proud,” (<span class="bvs">1Pe_5:5</span>.) God himself did show a lively image thereof in the person of Herod. And assuredly men cannot extol themselves higher than becometh them, but they shall make war with God, who, to the end he may surpass all, <span class="cite-ref">(762)</span> commandeth all flesh to keep silence. And if God did so sharply punish pride in a king whom prosperity did puff up, what shall become of those of the common sort who are ridiculously puffed up without cause? Furthermore, we must note the course of the history, that all things go well with Herod after that he had miserably vexed the Church; he enforced the nations round about him, being tamed with hunger, to come to crave pardon upon their knees, as if God had rewarded him well for his wicked fury. This was no small trial for the godly, who might have thought thus with themselves <span class="cite-ref">(763)</span> that God cared not for them, and they were afraid lest with Herod’s power his tyranny and cruelty should increase. But the Lord had another purpose, <span class="cite-ref">(764)</span> for he set the oppressor of his Church on high that he might have the greater fall. Therefore, that shadowish felicity, wherein he delighted too much, was unto him a certain falling against the day of slaughter. In like sort, when at this day we see the bloody enemies of the Church carried up upon the wings of fortune into heaven, there is no cause why we should be discouraged; but let us rather call to mind that saying of Solomon, </p><p>“Pride goeth before calamity; <LineBreak />and the heart is lifted up before a fall,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Pro_16:18</span>.) </p><p><em>Herod was displeased. </em>Luke useth the compound participle, <span class="lang el-gr">θυμομαχον</span> which signifieth <em>privy grudging </em>or <em>hatred. </em>Therefore Herod did not make open war against those cities; but such was his displeasure, that he essayed to subdue them by policy, as it were by undermining them by little and little. It is a rare matter, saith Demosthenes, for free cities to agree with monarchs. Moreover, Herod was naturally cruel, bold, of insatiable covetousness; and it is not to be doubted but that Tyre and Sidon were, as it were, certain bars or rails to stay his fury, as they were wealthy cities, and unaccustomed to bear the yoke. Also, the remembrance of their old glory might have encouraged them; forasmuch as pride cometh commonly of wealth, it is no marvel if these two cities were proud, the one whereof Isaiah calleth queen of the seas, whose merchants, he said, were kings, and her chapmen dukes, (<span class="bvs">Isa_23:8</span>.) Also, he saith elsewhere that Sidon was become proud by reason of her wealth. And although they had sundry times been brought almost to utter ruin, yet the commodiousness of their situation did shortly restore them to their wonted state. Hereby it came to pass that they could more hardly digest Agrippa, of late a base fellow, a man of no estimation, <span class="cite-ref">(765)</span> and one who had been let out of prison; especially seeing that he had behaved himself so cruelly toward his own subjects, and was troublesome and injurious to his neighbors. </p><p><em>Forasmuch as their country was nourished. </em>It had not been good for him to have assailed the men of Tyre and Sidon with open war, therefore he giveth commandment that there should no corn nor victual be carried <span class="cite-ref">(766)</span> out of his realm. By this means did he, without any army, besiege them by little and little. For the borders of both cities were strait, and their ground barren, whereas there was a great people to be fed. Therefore, after that they were tamed with hunger, they humbly crave peace, and that not free, for assuredly they had some laws given them; and it is to be thought that this Blastus mentioned by Luke was not with bare words persuaded, but with rewards [gifts] won to entreat the peace. <span class="cite-ref">(767)</span> I know not why Erasmus did think it good to translate this place otherwise than the words import. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(761)</span> “Memorabilis,” a memorable. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(762)</span> “Ut solus emineat,” that he alone may have the pre eminence. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(763)</span> “Quibus obrepere suspieio poterat,” who might be led to suspect. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(764)</span> “Sed longa aliud fnit Dei consilium,” but very different was the purpose of God. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(765)</span> “Obscurae fortunas,” of obscure origin. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(766)</span> “Illis... importari,” be imported to them. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(767)</span> “Ut pacis esset interpres,” to intercede for peace. </p></div></div>
