<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Wherefore, holy brethren, etc. </em>He concludes the preceding doctrine with a necessary exhortation, that the Jews should attentively consider what sort of being and how great Christ is. As he had before, by naming him a teacher and a priest, briefly compared him with Moses and Aaron, so he now includes both clauses; for he adorns him with two titles, as he sustains a twofold character in the Church of God. Moses was a prophet and a teacher, and Aaron was a priest; but the two offices belong to Christ. If then we seek rightly to know him, we must inquire what sort of being he is; yea, he must be clothed with his own power, lest we lay hold on an empty shadow and not on him. <span class="cite-ref">(53)</span></p><p>First, the word <em>consider, </em>is important, for it intimates that singular attention is required, as he cannot be disregarded with impunity, and that at the same time the true knowledge of Christ is sufficient to dissipate the darkness of all errors. And to encourage them the more to pursue this study, he reminds them of their <em>calling</em>; as though he had said, “God favored you with no common grace when He called you into his kingdom; <span class="cite-ref">(54)</span> it now remains that you have your eyes fixed on Christ as your leader in the way.” <span class="cite-ref">(55)</span> For the calling of the godly cannot be otherwise confirmed than by a thorough surrender of themselves to Christ. We ought not therefore to regard this as said only to the Jews, but that it is a general truth addressed to all who desire to come into the kingdom of God; they ought sedulously to attend to Christ, for he is the sole instructor of our faith, and has confirmed it by the sacrifice of himself; for <em>confession, </em>or profession, is to be taken here for faith, as thought he had said, that the faith we profess is vain and of no avail, unless Christ be its object. <span class="cite-ref">(56)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(53)</span> He calls them “holy brethren.” Stuart takes holy as meaning “consecrated, devoted, i.e. to Christ, set apart as Christians.” The people of Israel were called holy in the same sense, not because they were spiritually holy, but because they were set apart and adopted as God’s people. The word saints, at the commencement of Paul’s Epistles, means the same thing. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(54)</span> The word heavenly, may also mean a call from heaven. See <span class="bvs">Heb_12:25</span>. It is no doubt both, it is a call to the enjoyment of heavenly things, as well as a call that comes from heaven. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(55)</span> This is the only place in which Christ is called an Apostle, the design no doubt was to institute a comparison between him and Moses, who is often said to have been sent by God, as Christ is said to have been sent by the Father: they might both therefore be rightly called Apostles, i.e., messengers sent by God. And then he adds, high priest, that he might afterwards make a comparison between him and Aaron. </p><p>He had before exalted Christ as a teacher above all the prophets, including no doubt Moses among the rest; but here refers to Moses as the leader of the people, as one sent especially by God to conduct them from Egypt through the wilderness to the land of Canaan. But as our call is from heaven and to heaven, Christ is sent as a messenger to lead us to the heavenly country. We hence see that in this connection the “heavenly calling” is to be taken most suitably as a call to heaven. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(56)</span> The simpler meaning of this phrase is to view it as sort of Hebraism, when a noun is put for an adjective or a participle; and it is so rendered by Schleusner and Stuart, “professed by us,” or, “whom we profess.” See similar instances in chapter <span class="bvs">Heb_10:23</span>, and in <span class="bvs">2Co_9:13</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
