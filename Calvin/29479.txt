<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>In whom we have redemption. </em>He now proceeds to set forth in order, that all parts of our salvation are contained in Christ, and that he alone ought to shine forth, and to be seen conspicuous above all creatures, inasmuch as he is the beginning and end of all things. In the <em>first </em>place, he says that we have <em>redemption </em><span class="cite-ref">(300)</span> and immediately explains it as meaning the <em>remission of sins</em>; for these two things agree together by <em>apposition </em><span class="cite-ref">(301)</span> For, unquestionably, when God remits our transgressions, he exempts us from condemnation to eternal death. This is our liberty, this our glorying in the face of death — that our sins are not imputed to us. He says that this redemption was procured through the <em>blood of Christ</em>, for by the sacrifice of his death all the sins of the world have been expiated. Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that this is the sole price of reconciliation, and that all the trifling of Papists as to satisfactions is blasphemy. <span class="cite-ref">(302)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(300)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Redemption et deliurance</span>;” — “Redemption and deliverance.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(301)</span> The following explanation of the meaning of the term <em>apposition </em>is furnished in a marginal note in our author’s French version: “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est quand deux noms substantifs appartenans a vne mesme chose, sont mis ensemble sans conionction, comme par declaration l’vn et l’autre</span>;” — “This is when two substantive nouns, relating to the same thing, are placed together without being conjoined, as if by way of explanation, the one and the other.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(302)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Blasphemes execrables</span>;” — “Execrable blasphemies.” </p></div></div>
