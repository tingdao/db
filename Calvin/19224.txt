<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah shews in this verse that prophetic doctrine was useless to an obstinate people; for there is a contrast, no doubt, to be understood betweenthe voice of God, which had constantly resounded in Judea, and the tumultuous clamours of enemies; for the prophets, one after another, had reproved the people, but without effect. Now, then, as they were deaf to God’s voice, the Prophet declares that new teachers were now come who would address them in another way, and in an unusual manner. <em>The voice </em>then <em>of rumor is heard; </em>“ye would not hear me and other servants of God; but a <em>voice of rumor comes from the north: </em>the Chaldeans shall be your teachers; I send you to their school, since I have spent my labor for many years in vain, as all those have done who before me diligently sought to lead you to the right way, whom God employed, and who faithfully endeavored to secure your safety; but they were no more attended to than I am, and therefore they ceased to teach you. I now turn you over to the Chaldeans; they shall teach you.” This is the simple meaning. </p><p><em>The voice of rumor, </em>he says, or literally, of hearing, <span class="lang he-il">שמועה</span><em>, shimuoe, </em>comes; that is, the voice which shall be heard, for they had closed their ears to the prophetic warnings; <em>and a great tumult </em>or commotion <em>from the land of the north </em>We now then see that the Chaldeans are set in opposition to the prophets, who had labored in vain among the Jews; as though Jeremiah had said that the Jews would, willing or unwilling, be made to attend to this tumultuous noise; and he says that it would be for the purpose of <em>turning the cities of Judah to desolation and an habitation of dragons </em><span class="cite-ref">(21)</span> It follows — </p><p><strong>(21)</strong> The verse may be thus rendered, — </p><p>A sound is heard! — behold it comes, Even a great commotion, from the land of the North, To make the cities of Judah a desolation, The habitation of dragons. </p><p><em>Blayney </em>is right in taking the first words by themselves, but, “Hark, a voice!” is not a true version, <span class="lang he-il">שמועה</span> is here a passive participle. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
