<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Shout and sing. </em>He again exhorts the godly to rejoice in the Lord, at the same time reminding them what is the nature of true joy, and on what it is founded. We have no other happiness than to have God dwelling <em>in the midst of us</em>. But for this, our life would be wretched and unhappy, though we should have abundance of other blessings and of every kind of riches. Now, if our heart be set on our <em>treasure</em>, (<span class="bvs">Mat_6:21</span>,) this happiness will attract all our feelings. </p><p><em>The Holy One of Israel. </em>He calls him <em>the Holy One</em>, in order to inform us what he intends to prove himself to be to us, while he dwells with us; that is, that not only his majesty may fill our minds with reverence towards him, for it would at the same time overwhelm us with terror; but that he may vouchsafe to make us the objects of his peculiar care, though separated from the rest of the world. He calls him <em>the Holy One</em>, from the effect produced; for, by gathering us to himself, (<span class="bvs">Eph_1:10</span>,) and saving us by his grace, he may be said to <em>sanctify </em>us to be his own property. Accordingly, if God is with us, the conviction of his presence will fill us with inconceivable joy. Hence it follows that, when he is absent, we continue to be exposed to grief and sadness. </p><p>By the words, <em>Shout and sing</em>, he means that when God magnifies his power <em>in the midst of us</em>, he gives us occasion for no ordinary joy. Again, by directly addressing <em>the inhabitants of Zion</em>, he intimates that all are not capable of so great a blessing, and at the same time indirectly exhorts them to maintain unity of faith, that, by being united to the Church, we may partake of this blessed joy. </p></div>
