<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_24:43</span><strong>.</strong><em>If the householder had known. </em>Luke relates this discourse of Christ at a different place from Matthew; and we need not wonder at this, for in the twelfth chapter, where (as we have formerly explained) he collects out of various discourses a summary of doctrine, he inserts also this parable. Besides, he introduces a general preface that the disciples should <em>wait for their master, </em>with their <em>loins girt, </em>and carrying <em>burning lamps </em>in their hands. To this statement corresponds the parable, which we shall soon afterwards find in <span class="bvs">Mat_25:1</span> about the <em>wise and foolish virgins. </em></p><p>In a few words Christ glances rapidly at the manner in which believers ought to conduct their pilgrimage in the world; for first he contrasts the <em>girding of the loins </em>with sloth, and <em>burning lamps </em>with the darkness of ignorance. First, then, Christ enjoins the disciples to be ready and equipped for the journey, that they may pass rapidly through the world, and may seek no fixed abode or resting-place but in heaven. The warning is highly useful; for though ungodly men have likewise in their mouth this form of expression, “the course of life,” yet we see how they lay themselves down in the world, and remain unmoved in their attachment to it. But God does not bestow the honorable title of his children on any but those who acknowledge that they are strangers on the earth, and who not only are at all times prepared to leave it, but likewise move forward, in an uninterrupted “course,” towards the heavenly life. Again, as they are surrounded on all sides by darkness, so long as they remain in the world, he furnishes them with <em>lamps, </em>as persons who are to perform a journey during the night. The first recommendation is, to run vigorously; and the next is, to have clear information as to the road, that believers may not weary themselves to no purpose by going astray; for otherwise it would be better to stumble in the way, than to perform a journey in uncertainty and mistake. As to the expression, <em>girding the loins, </em>it is borrowed from the ordinary custom of Eastern nations in wearing long garments. </p></div>
