<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Know ye that our brother, etc. </em>Since the termination of the Greek verb<span class="lang el-gr">γινώσκετε, </span> will admit of either renderings, we may read, “Ye know,” or, “Know ye;” but I prefer the latter reading, though I do not reject the other. <span class="cite-ref">(293)</span> The probability is, that he was informing the Jews on the other side of the sea of what they did not know. Now, if this <em>Timothy </em>was the renowned companion of Paul, which I am inclined to think, it is very probable that either Luke or Clement was the author of this Epistle. Paul, indeed, more usually calls him his son; and then what immediately follows does not apply to Paul; for it appears that the writer was at liberty and at his own disposal; and besides, that he was then anywhere rather than at Rome; nay, it is very probable, that he was going round through various cities, and was then preparing to pass over the sea. Now all these particulars might have been suitable to the circumstances either of Luke or of Clement after the death of Paul. <span class="cite-ref">(294)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(293)</span> The Vulgate Beza and almost all expounders, render it as an imperative, “Know ye.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(294)</span> The words<span class="lang el-gr">ἀπολελυμένον </span> in this verse, has been rendered by Macknight and some others, “sent away.” It is no doubt used in the sense of dismissing, dissolving, or sending away an assembly or a multitude, but not of sending away a person on a message. The two things are wholly distinct. The verb means to set loose, to loosen to release and hence to dismiss, to set at liberty, to make free, and never in the sense of sending a person to a place on business, or with an errand or message. The objection that we do not read elsewhere of Timothy’s imprisonment is of no weight for the history we have of those times is very brief; and if we judge from the state of things at that period, there is nothing more probable than that Timothy shared the lot of Paul and of others. It is also probable that he was not imprisoned at Rome, where Paul was, but at some other place, for Paul says he expected him soon; and he does not say “If he returns quickly,” but “if he come quickly.” —<em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
