<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Now a feast of the Jews was at hand. </em>Though I do not affirm it, yet it is probable that this happened during the second year after Christâ€™s baptism. As to this feast, which the Evangelist mentions, it is not necessary at present to say much. For what purpose and use it was enjoined, Moses shows, (<span class="bvs">Lev_23:34</span>.) It was, that by this annual ceremony the Jews might call to remembrance, that their fathers lived forty years in <em>tabernacles, </em>when they had no houses, that they might thus celebrate the grace of God displayed in their deliverance. We have formerly said that there were two reasons why Christ came to Jerusalem during this <em>feast. </em>One was, that, being subject to the Law, in order to redeem us all from its bondage, he wished to omit no part of the observation of it; and the other was, that, amidst a numerous and extraordinary assemblage of people, he had a better opportunity of advancing the Gospel. But now the Evangelist relates that Christ kept himself in retirement at Galilee, as if he did not intend to come to Jerusalem. </p></div>
