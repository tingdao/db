It may be, indeed, that the disputation was had in presence of the people. But lest any man should think that the common people were suffered hand over head to handle the matter, Luke doth plainly make mention of the apostles and elders, as it was more meet that they should hear the matter and to decide it.<span class="cite-ref">(92)</span> But let us know, that here is prescribed by God a form and an order in assembling synods, when there ariseth any controversy which cannot otherwise be decided. For seeing that many did daily gainstand Paul, this disputation alone, by reason whereof there was great ruin like to ensue, and which was already come to hot combats, did enforce him to go to Jerusalem.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(91)</span></p><p>“ Legitimi,” lawful. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(92)</span></p><p>“ Sicut magis idonei erant cognitores,” as they were more apt to take cognisance of it. </p></div></div>
