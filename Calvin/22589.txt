<div class="comment-content"><p>He afterwards subjoins, that the wounds vault be grievous; but he speaks as of what was present, <em>Grievous, </em>he says, <em>are the wounds </em>Grievous means properly full of grief; others render it desperate or incurable, but it is a meaning which suits not this place; for <span class="lang he-il">אנושה</span>, <em>anushe, </em>means what we express in French by douloureuse. <em>The wounds, </em>then, <em>are full of grief: for it came, </em>(something is understood; it may suitably be referred to the enemy, or, what is more approved, to the slaughter) — It came then, that is, the slaughter, <span class="cite-ref">(68)</span><em>to Judah; it has reached to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself. </em>He says first, to Judah, speaking of the land; and then he confines it to the cities; for when the gates are closed up against enemies, they are forced to stop. But the Prophet says, that the cities would be no hindrance to the enemies to approach the very gates and even the chief city of Judah, that is, Jerusalem; and this, we know, was fulfilled. It is the same then as though he said that the whole kingdom of Israel would be so laid waste, that their enemies would not he content with victory, but would proceed farther and besiege the holy city: and this Sennacherib did. For after having subverted the kingdom of Israel, as though it was not enough to draw the ten tribes into exile, he resolved to take possession of the kingdom of Judah; and Jerusalem, as Isaiah says, was left as a tent. We hence see that the threatening of the Prophet Micah were not in vain. It now follows — </p><p><strong>(68)</strong> Or rather the stroke before mentioned; for the true reading is no doubt <span class="lang he-il">מכתה</span>, her wound or her stroke, in the singular. Though there are but two MSS. which have this reading, yet the previous participle noun, <span class="lang he-il">אנושה</span>, being singular, and the following verbs or participles being in the same number, favor this supposition. The corresponding word in the Septuagint is also in the singular number — <span class="lang el-gr">ἡ πληγη ἀυτης</span>, her stroke, stripe or scourge. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
