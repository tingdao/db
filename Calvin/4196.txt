<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Now Korah, the son of Izhar. </em>The impious conspiracy is here related of a few men, but these of the highest rank, whose object was to subvert and destroy the divinely-appointed priesthood. They make their attack, indeed, upon Moses, and accuse him of ruling unjustly; for thus it is that turbulent persons are carried away without reason or discrimination; but, the only cause why they are set against him is because they suppose him to be the originator of the priesthood, as we easily collect from his reply. For he does not command them to stand forth, in order that they may decide respecting the political government or chieftainship, but that it may be made plain whether God acknowledges them as priests; nor does he reproach the Levites with anything but that, not content with their own lot, they have an unreasonable ambition to obtain the honor of the high-priesthood. It was jealousy, then, that instigated Korah and his companions to set on foot first a quarrel, and then a tumult; respecting the priesthood, because they were indignant that the hope of attaining that honor was taken away from themselves and their posterity for ever. Thus there never was any more deadly or abominable plague in the Church of God, than ambition; inasmuch as it cannot be that those who seek for pre-eminence should range themselves beneath God’s yoke. Hence arises the dissolution of legitimate authority, when each one neglects the duties of his position, and aims at his own private advancement. </p><p>Now, this conspiracy was the more formidable, because the sedition did not arise from the dregs of the people, but amongst the princes themselves, who were of high dignity, and held in the greatest estimation. For although there were only four leaders of the faction, there is but little room to doubt but that the purpose of the two hundred and fifty was the same; for they would never have eagerly embarked in a grave and invidious contest for the sake of four men; but the fact was, that all unholy covetousness misled them all, for there was none of them who did not expect some prize as a reward of victory. They not only, then, dissemble their mental disease, but conceal it under an honorable pretext; for they pretend that they are instigated by zeal for the public good, and that their object is the defense of liberty. For, inasmuch as ambition is crafty, it is never destitute of some specious excuse: thus, whilst schismatics are influenced by nothing but pride to disturb the peace of the Church, they always invent plausible motives, whereby they may conciliate in some degree the favor of the ignorant, or even of the unstable and worthless. We must, therefore, cautiously weigh the designs of those who seek to make innovations, and to overthrow a state of things which might be endured; for thorough investigation will make it plain that; they aim at something besides what they pretend. By the, fact of their so speedily engaging such a multitude of persons in their party, we perceive how disposed man’s nature is to the most unpromising and unreasonable revolts in the world. Four worthless men wickedly endeavor to overthrow Moses and Aaron; and straightway two hundred and fifty persons are ready to follow them, not of the populace, but chiefs of the tribes, whose reputation might dazzle the eyes of the simple. Hence we must be the more cautious, lest any bugbears <em>(larvae) </em>should deceive us into making rash innovations. </p><p>With respect to the wording of the passage, some refer the verb “he took,” <span class="cite-ref">(86)</span> to the other conspirators, as if it were said that Korah stirred them up. Others explain it that he instigated himself, and hurried himself onwards by his evil passions. I do not, however, assent to either signification, but take it for “he set to work” <em>(aggressus est.) </em>When it is afterwards said that “they rose up before Moses,” some understand the words according to their simple meaning, others in a bad sense; and undoubtedly here the expression “before the face of,” is equivalent to <em>“against,” </em>and thus indicates the wantonness of their aggression. There is more difficulty in the words <span class="lang he-il">קראי מועד</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(87)</span><em>kerei mogned. </em>All, however, almost with one consent, translate them “great in the congregation;” but since the word <span class="lang he-il">קריים</span>,<em>keriira, </em>generally signifies persons <em>called </em>or <em>invited, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">מועד</span>, <em>mogned, </em>not only an assembly, but also an appointed time, or convention, it seems probable to me that these princes and men of high name are stated to have been present, because they were called according to appointment: as if Moses had said that they were called at a fixed time, or by agreement. For neither do I see any reason why, after the word <span class="lang he-il">עדה</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(88)</span><em>gnedah, </em><span class="lang he-il">מועד</span><em>, mogned, </em>should be used with the same meaning. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(86)</span><em>A.V</em>. , “took <em>men</em>. ” There has been very much discussion among the commentators respecting this word. Holden says, “There is nothing in the Hebrew answering to the word <em>men, </em>and the verb is in the singular number; the received version, therefore, can scarcely be correct. The most easy and natural construction of the original is, ‘And Korah took (i.e., won over, or drew into a conspiracy with him) both Dathan and Abiram,’ etc. This agrees with other parts of Scripture which attribute this rebellion to Korah, <span class="bvs">Num_27:3</span>; <span class="bvs">Jud_1:11</span>.” And this appears to be the general opinion. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(87)</span><em>A.V.</em>, “famous in the congregation.” <em>S.M. </em>Vocabantur ad concilium. — <em>W. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(88)</span><span class="lang he-il">עדה</span>, <em>A.V.</em>, “of the assembly.” </p></div></div>
