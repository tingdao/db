<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>But if through meat thy brother is grieved, etc. </em>He now explains how the offending of our brethren may vitiate the use of good things. And the first thing is, — that love is violated, when our brother is made to grieve by what is so trifling; for it is contrary to love to occasion grief to any one. The next thing is, — that when the weak conscience is wounded, the price of Christ’s blood is wasted; for the most abject brother has been redeemed by the blood of Christ: it is then a heinous crime to destroy him by gratifying the stomach; and we must be basely given up to our own lusts, if we prefer meat, a worthless thing, to Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(428)</span> The third reason is, — that since the liberty attained for us by Christ is a blessing, we ought to take care, lest it should be evil spoken of by men and justly blamed, which is the case, when we unseasonably use God’s gifts. These reasons then ought to influence us, lest by using our liberty, we thoughtlessly cause offenses. <span class="cite-ref">(429)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(428)</span> From the words “destroy not,” etc., some have deduced the sentiment, that those for whom Christ died may perish for ever. It is neither wise nor just to draw a conclusion of this kind; for it is one that is negatived by many positive declarations of Scripture. Man’s inference, when contrary to God’s word, cannot be right. Besides, the Apostle’s object in this passage is clearly this, — to exhibit the <em>sin </em>of those who disregarded without saying that it actually effected that evil. Some have very unwisely attempted to obviate the inference above mentioned, by suggesting, that the destruction meant was that of comfort and edification. But no doubt the Apostle meant the ruin of the soul; hence the urgency of his exhortation, — “Do not act in such a way as tends to endanger the safety of a soul for whom Christ has shed his blood;” or, “Destroy not,” that is, as far as you can do so. Apostles and ministers are said to “save” men; some are exhorted here not to “destroy” them. Neither of these effects can follow, except in the first instance, God grants his blessing, and in the second his permission; and his permission as to his people he will never grant, as he has expressly told us. See <span class="bvs">Joh_10:27</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(429)</span> “Vestrum bonum<span class="lang el-gr">,” ὑμῶν τὸ ἀγαθόν. </span> Some, such as [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Hammond </span>], [<span class="bvs">Scott </span>], [<span class="bvs">Chalmers </span>], etc., agree with [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>], and view this “good,” or privilege, to be Christian liberty, or freedom from ceremonial observances, (see <span class="bvs">1Co_10:29</span>;) but [<span class="bvs">Origen </span>], [<span class="bvs">Ambrose </span>], [<span class="bvs">Theodoret </span>], [<span class="bvs">Mede </span>], etc., consider that the gospel is meant. The first opinion is the most suitable to the passage. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
