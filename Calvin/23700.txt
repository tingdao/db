<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>For the Son of man will come. </em>That the doctrine which has just been laid down may more deeply affect our minds, Christ places before our eyes the future judgment; for if we would perceive the worthlessness of this fading life, we must be deeply affected by the view of the heavenly life. So tardy and sluggish is our mind, that it needs to be aided by looking towards heaven. Christ summons believers to his judgment-seat, to lead them to reflect at all times that they lived for no other object than to long after that blessed redemption, which will be revealed at the proper time. The admonition is intended to inform us, that they do not strive in vain who set a higher value on the confession of faith than on their own life. “Place your lives fearlessly,” says he, “in my hand, and under my protection; for I will at length appear as your avenger, and will fully restore you, though for the time you may seem to have perished.” </p><p><em>In the glory of the Father, with his angels. </em>These are mentioned to guard his disciples against judging of his kingdom from present appearances; for hitherto he was unknown and despised, being concealed under the form and condition of a servant. He assures them that it will be far otherwise when he shall appear as the Judge of the world. As to the remaining part of the passage in Mark and Luke, the reader will find it explained under the tenth chapter of Matthew. <span class="cite-ref">(469)</span></p><p><em>And then will he render to every one according to his actions. </em>The reward of works has been treated by me as fully as was necessary under another passage. <span class="cite-ref">(470)</span> It amounts to this: When a <em>reward </em>is promised to good works, their merit is not contrasted with the justification which is freely bestowed on us through faith; nor is it pointed out as the cause of our salvation, but is only held out to excite believers to aim at doing what is right, <span class="cite-ref">(471)</span> by assuring them that their labor will not be lost. There is a perfect agreement, therefore, between these two statements, that we are <em>justified freely</em>, (<span class="bvs">Rom_3:24</span>,) because we are received into God’s favor without any merit; <span class="cite-ref">(472)</span> and yet that God, of his own good pleasure, bestows on our works a <em>reward </em>which we did not deserve. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(469)</span> Harmony, vol. 1 p. 466. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(470)</span> “<em>Alibi </em>is a general reference, but <em class="lang fr-fr">en un autre passage </em> is more specific; and the passage to which he probably refers the reader for a distinct exhibition of his views, and in which, so far as I remember, he handles this subject more fully than in any other part of the Gospels, is <span class="bvs">Joh_4:36</span>.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(471)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A faire bonnes oeuvres</span>;” — “to do good works.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(472)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sans que nous en soyons dignes, ou l’ayons meritd</span>;” — “without being worthy of it, or having deserved it.” </p></div></div>
