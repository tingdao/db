<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>All nations which thou hast made shall come. </em><span class="cite-ref">(485)</span> If any would rather limit what is here stated to David’s present case, this view does not seem liable to any material objection. He, in fact, often enhances the Divine goodness of which he himself had experience by the like magnificent strain. It may, however, be fitly extended to the universal power of God; but whether he speaks of the grace that was bestowed upon himself alone, or treats, in general, of the works of God, we must bear in mind what has been observed in another place, that whenever he celebrates the prevalence of true godliness among the heathen, he has an eye to the kingdom of Christ, prior to whose coming God gave only the initial or dawning manifestation of his glory, which at length was diffused through the whole world by the preaching of the Gospel. David was not ignorant of the future calling of the Gentiles; but this being a doctrine with which Jewish ears were not familiar, that people would have felt it a disagreeable announcement, to have been told that the Gentiles should come to worship God indiscriminately with the children of Abraham, and, all distinction being removed, become partakers with them of heavenly truth. To soften the announcement, he asserts that the Gentiles also <em>were created by God, </em>so that it ought not to be accounted strange if they, being enlightened also, should at length acknowledge Him who had created and fashioned them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(485)</span> “<em>Among the gods</em>, <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , among the gods of the Gentiles, such as Baal, Baal-berith, Baal-zebub, Dagon, Ashtoreth, Chemosh, Milcom, Nisroch, and especially, as R.

There is good reason for doubting, however, with Parkhurst, whether the word <em>Alaim </em>ever positively means princes, judges, or magistrates; and the passage (<span class="bvs">Jud_13:22</span>) quoted by Buxtorf, to show that it sometimes means <em>an angel</em>, only proves that Manoah intended to say that he had seen God in the person of his angel.
