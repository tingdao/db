<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>And it come to pass when he heareth the words</em>. He shews that it is not without reason that he has used so solemn and severe an adjuration; since nothing is more common than for men to flatter themselves, and by levity to evade the decision of God. He therefore repeats, that they are standing before God, who neither deceives, nor is deceived, nor even allows Himself to be thought lightly of; in order that they may tremble at His threats. Let the majesty of God, he says, be dreaded by you; so that none who despises Him, and wantons in his own lusts, should promise himself impunity. “To bless himself in his heart,” is to hope in his secret imaginations that all will go well; as the hypocrites do, who, in their foolish self-adulation, applaud themselves deceitfully, lest they should hear God thundering. <span class="cite-ref">(269)</span></p><p>From this passage, therefore, let us learn that nothing is worse than to hope for peace, whilst we wage war with God; and to promise ourselves that He will let us alone, when we provoke Him by the impetuosity of our lusts. </p><p>The conclusion of the verse, “to add the drunken to the thirsty,” is variously explained on account of its ambiguity. <span class="cite-ref">(270)</span> I am ashamed to repeat the silly triflings of the Hebrew interpreters. To me it seems unquestionable that Moses, by a proverbial figure of speech, forbids us to excite the appetites of the flesh, already sufficiently heated, by new stimulants. As, therefore, they are said to add oil to the grate, who add more flames to a fire already lighted, <span class="cite-ref">(271)</span> so they are said to add the drunken to the thirsty who seek provocatives of their audacity, in order to sin more freely; for lust in a man is like an insatiable dropsy; and if any one indulges in such intemperance, he adds the drunken to the thirsty, <em>i e</em>. , the madness of his own folly to unrestrained desire. <span class="lang he-il">רויה</span>, <em>ravah</em>, however, is, in my opinion, used actively, as elsewhere. In <span class="bvs">Psa_23:5</span>, it is said, “My cup <span class="lang he-il">רויה</span>, <em>revayah</em>, runneth over;” and, in like manner, in <span class="bvs">Psa_66:12</span>, a well-watered land <span class="cite-ref">(272)</span> is expressed by the same word, because it abundantly moistens the corn and grass. It is very appropriate that the desires of the flesh, that we burn with, should be compared to thirst; and the licentious impetuosity, which carries us away without reflection, to drunkenness; because the sinner stupifies himself into forgetfulness of the distinction between good and evil. And thence Paul calls those who are plunged in brutal forgetfulness of God and themselves, <span class="lang el-gr">ἀπηλγηκότες</span> (past feeling.) ( <span class="bvs">Eph_4:19</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(269)</span> Addition in <em>Fr</em>. , “par maniere de dire.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(270)</span><em>Lat</em>. , “Ut addat ebriam sitienti.” <em>A</em>. <em>V</em>. , “To add drunkenness to thirst;” <em>Margin</em>, “The drunken to the thirsty.” So Ainsworth, “To add the drunken, <em>to wit</em>, the drunken <em>soul </em>to the thirsty, or the moist to the dry, meaning to add sin unto sin in abundance, as in <span class="bvs">Isa_30:1</span>.” Dathe follows Le Clerc, and explains it, “to add water to a thirsty soul;” and compares it to <span class="bvs">Isa_44:3</span>, where, he says, the same metaphor is used, though in a good sense. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(271)</span> “Que ceux, qui augmentent le mal, mettent l’huile en la cheminee;” that those who augment an evil put oil into the chimney. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(272)</span><em>A</em>. <em>V</em>. , “a wealthy (<em>margin</em>, moist) <em>place</em>. ” See Cal.
