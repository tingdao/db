<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here expresses more clearly what he bad touched upon, even that this war would not be that of the Persians, but of God himself. He then says, that God had <em>opened his treasure, </em>even because he has various and manifold ways and means, which cannot be comprehended by men, when he resolves to destroy the ungodly. That monarchy was impregnable according to the judgment of men; but God here says that he had hidden means by which he would lay waste Babylon and reduce it to nothing. Then what is by a similitude called the <em>treasure </em>of God, means such a way as surpasses the comprehension of men, that is, when God executes his judgments in a way hidden and unexpected. </p><p>As, then, the faithful could hardly conceive what Jeremiah said, he raises up their thoughts to God’s providence, which ought not to be subjected to human judgment; for it is absurd in men to judge of God’s power according to the perceptions of the flesh; it is the same as though they attempted to include heaven and earth in the hollow of their hand. God himself says, that he takes heaven and earth in the hollow of his hand. When, therefore, men seek to comprehend the power of God, it is like a fly attempting to devour all the mountains. Hence the Prophet reproves this presumption to which we are all by nature inclined, even to determine according to the comprehension of our minds what God is about or ought to do, as though his power were not infinite. </p><p>This is the reason why the Prophet says, God <em>hath opened his treasury; </em>and then, <em>he hath thence brought forth the instruments of his wrath, </em>that is, from his treasury, even in a way and manner which was then incomprehensible. <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span> And subjoined is the reason, <em>Because this is the work of God </em>alone, <em>the God of hosts, in the land of the Chaldeans </em><span class="cite-ref">(66)</span> Here the Prophet briefly concludes, intimating, that the faithful ought quietly to wait until what he taught came to pass, even because it was the work of God. And there is nothing more absurd than for men to seek to measure God’s power, as it has been said, by their own judgment. It follows, — but I cannot explain the verse now. </p><p><strong>(65)</strong> “Treasury” here means an armory or arsenal, as rendered by <em>Blayney: </em>and then “instruments” signify weapons, drawn from the armory. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(66)</strong> Literally it is, — </p><p>For a work — this the Lord Jehovah of hosts has In the land of the Chaldeans. </p><p>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
