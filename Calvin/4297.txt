<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>Then the priest shall wash his clothes. </em>At first sight there seems to be a discrepancy in the facts, that the heifer was sacred to God, and pure, and still that the priest was polluted by touching it; yet they accord very well with each other. But that both the priest as well as the minister who made the burning, were unclean until the evening, ought to have forcibly struck the people, and taught them the more to abominate sin. And, since it was not permitted to any but a man that was clean to gather the ashes, not that they should be laid anywhere but in a clean place, it was manifested by this sign that there was no impurity in the sacrifice itself, but that from an extraneous and adventitious pollution; because it was destined to purge away uncleanness, it was accounted in a certain sense unclean. Whence too the water, into which the ashes were thrown, was called the water of separation, as well as the expiation <span class="cite-ref">(23)</span> For this translation which I have given is the right one; and others improperly render it “for waters of separation, and for expiation.” The old interpreter has not given the sense amiss, as far as regards this word, “<em>because </em>the heifer is burnt for sin.” But since in Hebrew the word,<span class="lang he-il">חטאה </span><em>chateah </em><span class="cite-ref">(24)</span> means not only wickedness or sin, but also the sacrifice on which the curse is imposed; what Moses intended to convey is better expressed by the word “<em>expiation. </em>” But the expression “separation” has reference to the men, whose personal uncleanness excluded them from the holy congregation. But the question arises, why this ordinance is pronounced to be common to the strangers who sojourned in the land of Israel, as well as to the natives; because it was by no means reasonable that the uncircumcised should be purified. The reply is easy, that such strangers are not adverted to as were altogether aliens from the people, but those who, although born of heathen parentage, had embraced the Law. These God equalizes with the children of Abraham in the sacrifices and other religious services; for if their condition were different, the-church, into the body of which they were ingrafted, would be rent asunder. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(23)</span> “Nam expiatio est.” — <em>Lat</em>, v. 9. “It is a purification for sin.” — <em>A.V</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(24)</span><span class="lang he-il">למי נדה חטאת הוא</span><span class="lang el-gr">́̔Υδωρ ῥαντισμᾶ ἅγνισμά ἐστι·</span> — <em>LXX. </em>In aqua aspersionis; quia pro peccato vacca combusta est. — V.
