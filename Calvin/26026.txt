<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Saying, The Lord is actually risen. </em>By these words Luke means that those persons who had brought to the apostles joyful intelligence to confirm their minds, were informed by the disciples respecting another appearance. Nor can it be doubled that this mutual confirmation was the reward which God bestowed on them for their holy diligence. By a comparison of the time, we may conclude that Peter, after having returned from the sepulcher, was in a state of great perplexity and uncertainty, until Christ showed himself to him, and that, on the very day that he had visited the sepulcher, he obtained his wish. Hence arose that mutual congratulation among the eleven, that there was now no reason to doubt, because <em>the Lord had appeared to Simon. </em></p><p>But this appears to disagree with the words of Mark, who says, that the eleven <em>did not even believe </em>those two persons; for how could it be that those who were already certain now rejected additional witnesses, and remained in their former hesitation? By saying that <em>he is actually risen, </em>they acknowledge that the matter is beyond all doubt. First, I reply, that the general phrase contains a <em>synecdoche; </em>for some were harder or less ready to believe, and Thomas was more obstinate than all the rest, (<span class="bvs">Joh_20:25</span>.) Secondly, We may easily infer that they were convinced in the same way as usually happens to persons who are astonished, and who do not consider the matter calmly; and we know that such persons are continually falling into various doubts. However that may be, it is evident from Luke, that the greater part of them, in the midst of that overpowering amazement, not, only embraced willingly what was told them, but contended with their own distrust; for by the word <em>actually </em>they cut off all ground for doubt. And yet we shall soon afterwards see that, a second and a third time, in consequence of their astonishment, they fell back into their former doubts. </p></div>
