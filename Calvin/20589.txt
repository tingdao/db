He says <em>that violence had risen up into a rod of wickedness </em>Thus he confirms what he had touched upon, that the rod of God’s vengeance was not to be sought elsewhere than among the Israelites. God indeed had stirred up the king of Babylon to punish them: but the rod had grown up from the root of their wickedness by which the Israelites had provoked God’s anger: and so he adds, <em>that nothing should be left of them: nothing, says he, should remain safe, either of themselves or of their opulence: </em>for so I interpret <span class="lang he-il">המון</span><em>, hemon: </em>then, of their noise or multitude; either will do moderately well; <em>and there shall not be wailing for them </em>Jerome reads, <span class="lang he-il">נה</span>, <em>neh, </em>and hence translates — there shall not be rest among them: but the Prophet means that there shall be neither sorrow nor lament, because the slaughter of all would be promiscuous.
