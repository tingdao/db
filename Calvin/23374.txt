There is probability in the conjecture of <em>Augustine, </em>who thinks that there were two, but accounts for not more than one being mentioned here by saying, that this one was more generally known, and that the aggravation of his disease made the miracle performed on him the more remarkable. And, indeed, we see that Luke and Mark employ many words in describing the extraordinary rage of the devil, so as to make it evident that the wretched man, of whom they speak, was grievously fomented. The circumstance of their holding up to commendation one singular instance of Christ’s divine power is not inconsistent with the narrative of Matthew, in which another, though less known man, <span class="cite-ref">(547)</span> is also mentioned. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(547)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien qu'il ne lust pas rant eognu que le premier</span>;” — “though he was not so well known as the former.” </p></div></div>
