<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong>What follows, <em>God shall bruise Satan, etc.</em>, is a promise to confirm them, rather than a prayer. He indeed exhorts them to fight manfully against Satan, and promises that they should shortly be victorious. He was indeed once conquered by Christ, but not in such a way but that he renews the war continually. He then promises ultimate defeat, which does not appear in the midst of the contest. At the same time he does not speak only of the last day, when Satan shall be completely bruised; but as Satan was then confounding all things, raging, as it were, with loose or broken reins, he promises that the Lord would shortly subdue him, and cause him to be trodden, as it were, under foot. Immediately a prayer follows, â€” that the grace of Christ would be with them, that is, that they might enjoy all the blessings which had been procured for them by Christ. </p></div>
