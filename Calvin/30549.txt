<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>If we confess </em>He again promises to the faithful that God will be propitious to them, provided they acknowledge themselves <em>to be sinners</em>. It is of great moment to be fully persuaded, that when we have sinned, there is a reconciliation with God ready and prepared for us: we shall otherwise carry always a hell within us. Few, indeed, consider how miserable and wretched is a doubting conscience; but the truth is, that hell reigns where there is no peace with God. The more, then, it becomes us to receive with the whole heart this promise which offers free pardon to all who confess their sins. Moreover, this is founded even on the justice of God, because God who promises is true and just. For they who think that he is called <em>just</em>, because he justifies us freely, reason, as I think, with too much refinement, because justice or righteousness here depends on fidelity, and both are annexed to the promise. For God might have been just, were he to deal with us with all the rigor of justice; but as he has bound himself to us by his word, he would not have himself deemed just, except he forgives. <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span></p><p>But this confession, as it is made to God, must be in sincerity; and the heart cannot speak to God without newness of life. It then includes true repentance. God, indeed, forgives freely, but in such a way, that the facility of mercy does not become an enticement to sin. </p><p><em>And to cleanse us </em>The verb, <em>to cleanse</em>, seems to be taken in another sense than before; for he had said, that we are cleansed by the blood of Christ, because through him sins are not imputed; but now, having spoken of pardon, he also adds, that God cleanses us from iniquity: so that this second clause is different from the preceding. Thus he initiates that a twofold fruit comes to us from confession, — that God being reconciled by the sacrifice of Christ, forgives us, — and that he renews and reforms us. </p><p>Were any one to object and say, that as long as we sojourn in the world, we are never cleansed from all unrighteousness, with regard to our reformation: this is indeed true; but John does not refer to what God now performs in us. He is faithful, he says, to cleanse us, not today or tomorrow; for as long as we are surrounded with flesh, we ought to be in a continual state of progress; but what he has once begun, he goes on daily to do, until he at length completes it. So Paul says, that we are chosen, that we may appear without blame before God, (<span class="bvs">Col_1:22</span>;) and in another place he says, that the Church is cleansed, that it might be without spot or wrinkle. (<span class="bvs">Eph_5:27</span>.) </p><p>If yet any one prefers another explanation, that he says the same thing twice over, I shall not object. <span class="cite-ref">(62)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(61)</span> “Faithful” and “just” are nearly of the same import, having both a regard to God’s <em>promise</em>, only the latter affords a stronger or an additional ground of confidence, inasmuch as the fulfillment of God’s gracious promise is set forth as an act of justice. So that the penitent has here two of God’s attributes, faithfulness and justice, to encourage and support his faith. </p><p>We may, at the same time, consider “just” as having reference to forgiveness, and “faithful” to cleansing, according to a very common mode of stating things both in the Old and New Testament, the order in the second clause being reversed. Then “<em>just </em>” means the same as when Paul says, “that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus,” <span class="bvs">Rom_3:26</span>. Forgiveness is thus an act of justice, then, not to us, but to Christ, who made an atonement for sins. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(62)</span> That is, that he refers to forgiveness in the two clauses. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
