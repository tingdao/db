<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_12:39</span><strong>.</strong><em>A wicked generation </em>He does not merely charge that age with malice, but pronounces the Jews—or at least the scribes, and those who resembled them—to be a <em>wicked nation; </em>thus declaring that they labored under a hereditary disease of obstinacy. The word <span class="lang el-gr">γενεά</span> sometimes denotes an <em>age, </em>and sometimes a <em>people </em>or <em>nation. </em>He calls them <em>adulterous, </em>that is, spurious or illegitimate, <span class="cite-ref">(165)</span> because they were degenerated from the holy fathers; as the prophets reproach the men of their age with being not the descendants of Abraham, but the ungodly seed of Canaan. </p><p><em>Seeks a sign. </em>This leads to the inquiry, Does Christ address them with such harshness of language, because they wished to have a sign given them? for on other occasions God manifests that He is not so much displeased on this account. Gideon asks <em>a sign, </em>(<span class="bvs">Jud_6:17</span>,) and God is not angry, but grants his request; and though Gideon becomes importunate and asks another sign, yet God condescends to his weakness. Hezekiah does not ask a <em>sign, </em>and it is offered to him, though unsolicited, (<span class="bvs">Isa_38:7</span>.) Ahaz is severely blamed for refusing to ask a sign, as the prophet had enjoined him to do, (<span class="bvs">Isa_7:11</span>.) It is not solely, therefore, because they <em>ask a sign, </em>that Christ makes this attack upon the scribes, but because they are ungrateful to God, wickedly despise so many of his wonderful works, and try to find a subterfuge for not obeying his word. What a display was this, I do not say of indifference, but of malice, in shutting their eyes against so many <em>signs! </em>There was, therefore, no proper ground for this annoyance; and they had no other object in view than to appear to have a good reason for rejecting Christ. Paul condemns their posterity for the same crime, when he says that the Jews <em>require a sign, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_1:22</span>) </p><p><em>A sign shall not be given to it. </em>They had already been convicted by various miracles, and Christ does not abstain from exerting his power among them, for the purpose of rendering them inexcusable, but only means that <em>one sign </em>would stand for all, because they were unworthy of having their ungodly desire granted. “Let them rest satisfied,” says he, “with this sign, that as Jonah, brought up from the bottom of the sea, preached to the Ninevites, so they will hear the voice of a prophet risen from the dead.” The most of commentators, I am aware, display greater ingenuity in expounding this passage; but as the resemblance between Christ and Jonah does not hold at every point, we must inquire in what respect Christ compares himself to Jonah. For my own part, leaving the speculations of other men, I think that Christ intends to mark out that single point of resemblance which I have already hinted, that he will be their prophet after that he is risen from the dead. “You despise,” he says, “the Son of God, who has come down to you from heaven: but I am yet to die, and to rise from the grave, and to speak to you after my resurrection, as Jonah came from the bottom of the sea to Nineveh.” In this manner our Lord cuts off every pretense for their wicked demands, by threatening that he will be their Prophet after his resurrection, since they do not receive him while clothed with mortal flesh. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(165)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il entend qu’ils sont enfans bastars</span>;” — “he means that they are bastard children.” </p></div></div>
