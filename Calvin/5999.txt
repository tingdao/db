<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>So Joshua sent messengers, </em>etc Although it is not singular for messengers to prove their obedience by running and making haste, yet the haste which is here mentioned, shows how intent all were to have the work of expiation performed as speedily as possible, as they had been filled with the greatest anxiety in consequence of the stern denunciation — I will not be with you until you are purged of the anathema. They therefore ran swiftly, not merely to execute the commands of Joshua, but much more to appease the Lord. The things carried off by stealth, when placed before their eyes, were more than sufficient to explain the cause of the disgrace and overthrow which had befallen them. </p><p>It had been said that they had turned their backs on the enemy, because, being polluted with the accursed thing, they were deprived of the wonted assistance of God; it is now easy to infer from the sight of the stolen articles, that the Lord had deservedly become hostile to them. At the same time, they were reminded how much importance God attached to the delivery of the first-fruits of the whole land of Canaan in an untainted state, in order that his liberality might never perish from their memory. They also learned that while the knowledge of God penetrates to the most hidden recesses, it is in vain to employ concealment’s for the purpose of eluding his judgment. <span class="cite-ref">(73)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(73)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est folie de chercher couverture et deguisement pour eschapper son jugement et l’abuser</span>;” “It is folly to seek cover and disguise in order to escape his judgement and deceive him.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
