<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents. </em>The Psalmist still continues, as in the preceding verse, to speak of the extent of the kingdom. The Hebrews apply the appellation of <em>Tarshish </em>to the whole coast, which looks towards Cilicia. By <em>the isles, </em>therefore, is denoted the whole coast of the Mediterranean Sea, from Cilicia to Greece. As the Jews, contenting themselves with the commodities of their own country, did not undertake voyages to distant countries, like other nations; God having expressly required them to confine themselves within the limits of their own country, that they might not be corrupted by the manners of strangers; they were accustomed, in consequence of this, to apply the appellation of <em>isles </em>to those countries which were on the other side of the sea. I indeed admit that Cyprus, Crete, and other islands, are comprehended under this name; but I also maintain that it applies to all the territories which were situated beyond the Mediterranean Sea. By the words <span class="lang he-il">מנחה</span>, <em>minchah, a present, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">אשכר</span>, <em>eshcar, a gift, </em>must be understood any tribute or custom, and not voluntary offerings; for it is vanquished enemies, and the mark or token of their subjection, which are spoken of. These terms appear to be used intentionally in this place, in order to mitigate the odium attached to such a mark of subjugation; <span class="cite-ref">(137)</span> as if the inspired writer indirectly reproved subjects, if they defrauded their kings of their revenues. By <span class="lang he-il">שבא</span>, <em>Sheba, </em>some think Arabia is intended, and by <span class="lang he-il">שבא</span>,<em>Seba, </em>Ethiopia. Some, however, by the first word understand all that part of the Gulf of Arabia which lies towards Africa; and by the second, which is written with the letter <span class="lang he-il">ס</span>,<em>samech, </em>the country of Sabea, <span class="cite-ref">(138)</span> the more pleasant and fruitful country. This opinion is probably the more correct of the two. It is unnecessary here to remark how foolishly this passage has been wrested in the Church of Rome. They chant this verse as referring to the philosophers or wise men who came to worship Christ; as if, indeed, it were in their power of philosophers to make kings all upon a sudden; and in addition to this, to change the quarters of the world, to make of the east the south or the west. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(137)</span><span class="lang he-il">מנחה</span>,<em>minchah</em>, properly signifies a <em>friendly offering</em>; and <span class="lang he-il">אשכר</span>, <em>eshcar</em>, <em>a compensative present </em>made on account of benefits received, — a gift which a person presents as a token of gratitude. — See Appendix. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(138)</span> Supposed to be in Arabia Felix. “The Septuagint reads, ‘The kings of the Arabs, and Sabaeans, shall bring gifts.’ So that anciently, perhaps, Sheba was the general name of Arabia; and Seba, or Sabaea, was that particular province of it called Arabia Felix, lying to the South, between the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea.” — <em>Hewlett</em>. </p></div></div>
