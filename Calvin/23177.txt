<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Then Herod, having secretly called the Magi </em>The tyrant did not dare to avow his fear and uneasiness, lest he might give fresh courage to a people, by whom he knew that he was hated. In public, therefore, he pretends that this matter does not concern him, but <em>inquires secretly, </em>in order to meet immediate danger. Though a bad conscience made him timid, there can be no doubt that God struck his mind with an unusual fear, which for a time made him incapable of reflection, and almost deprived him of the use of reason. For nothing was more easy than to send one of his courtiers as an escort, under the pretense of courtesy, who would investigate the whole matter, and immediately return. Herod certainly was a man of no ordinary address, and of great courage. It is the more surprising that, in a case of extremity, and when the remedy is at hand, he remains in a state of amazement, and almost dead. Let us learn, that a miracle was effected, in rescuing the Son of God from the jaws of the lion. Not less at the present day does God infatuate his enemies, so that a thousand schemes of injuring and ruining his Church do not occur to their minds, and even the opportunities which are at hand are not embraced. The trick which Herod practiced on the <em>Magi, </em>by pretending that he also would come for the purpose of worshipping Christ, was avoided by the Lord, as we shall see, in another way. But as Herod’s dread of arousing the people against him deprived him of the use of his reason, so again he is driven by such madness, that he does not hesitate or shudder at the thought of provoking God. For he knew that, if a King were born, it was ordained by God, that he should raise up the throne “of David, which was fallen,” (<span class="bvs">Amo_9:11</span>.) He does not therefore attack men, but furiously dares to fight with God. Two things claim our attention. He was seized with a spirit of giddiness, to attack God; and, on the other hand, his manner of acting was childish: for his design was frustrated, so that he was like a “blind man groping in darkness.” <span class="cite-ref">(185)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(185)</span> Like many others of his scriptural allusions, this is not marked by our Author. It approaches very nearly to the language of one of the curses pronounced by Moses on the people of Israel, “If they should not hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God;” — “thou shalt grope at noon-day as <em>the blind gropeth in darkness,” </em>(<span class="bvs">Deu_28:15</span>.) But it is more likely that he had in his eye a passage from the book of Job. In the opening description of “the devices of the crafty,” <em>Herod, </em>who is pronounced by Calvin to have been “a man of no ordinary address, and another <em>Herod, </em>whom our Lord designates <em>that fox, </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_13:32</span>,) are so exactly delineated, that it might almost be imagined they had sat for the picture. He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. <em>They meet with darkness in the day-time, and grope in the noon-day as in the night,” </em>(<span class="bvs">Job_5:12</span>.) — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
