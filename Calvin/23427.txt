<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_10:9</span><strong>.</strong><em>Do not provide. </em>As the embassy <span class="cite-ref">(575)</span> was of such a nature, that Christ wished the disciples to traverse the whole of Judea within a few days, and immediately to return to him, he forbids to carry luggage with them, by which this speed may be retarded. Some have ignorantly supposed that the rule here laid down for the ministers of the word, or for the apostles, is perpetual. We shall presently meet with a few sentences which have a more extensive reference: but the present injunctions not to carry baggage must undoubtedly be restricted to that temporary commission of which I have already spoken. The whole of the prohibition of <em>gold, silver, a scrip, </em>and two <em>coats, </em>which is given by Matthew, must be read in immediate connection, as is evident from the other two Evangelists. </p><p>I have therefore chosen to translate <span class="lang el-gr">υὴ κτήσησθε</span>, <em>do not provide: </em>for our Lord simply intended to forbid them to <em>take any thing for the journey </em>They might have <em>scrips, </em>and <em>shoes, </em>and <em>a change of coats, </em>at home; but that they may be better prepared for the journey, he orders them to leave every thing that would be burdensome. Such too is the import of what Mark says, <em>to be shod with sandals </em>There is an appearance of contradiction as to the <em>staff, </em>or <em>stick </em>for, according to Mark, the <em>staff </em>is allowed, while according to Matthew and Luke it is refused. But there is an ambiguity in the use of the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שבט</span>, <em>(shebet;) </em>and the Evangelists, though they wrote in Greek, used the word <span class="lang el-gr">ῥάβδος</span> in various senses. Matthew and Luke mean by it a <em>rod </em>which would be burdensome to the person who carries it: while Mark means by it a <em>walking-stick </em>to support and relieve a traveler. It is evident, that in making a journey it was customary to carry a <em>staff; </em>and hence those words of Jacob, <em>With my staff, I passed over this Jordan, </em>(<span class="bvs">Gen_32:10</span>,) by which he acknowledges that he came empty and without money into Syria. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(575)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La commission et ambassade</span>;” — “the commission and einbassy.” </p></div></div>
