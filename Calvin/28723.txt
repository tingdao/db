<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>That he was seen by Cephas </em>He now brings forward <em>eye witnesses, ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">αὐτόπτας</span><em>) </em>as they are called by Luke, (<span class="bvs">Luk_1:2</span>,) who saw the accomplishment of what the Scriptures had foretold would take place. He does not, however, adduce them all, for he makes no mention of women. When, therefore, he says that he appeared first to Peter, you are to understand by this that he is put before all the <em>men, </em>so that there is nothing inconsistent with this in the statement of Mark (<span class="bvs">Mar_16:9</span>) that <em>he appeared to Mary. </em></p><p>But how is it that he says, that <em>he appeared to the twelve, </em>when, after the death of Judas, there were only eleven remaining? Chrysostom is of opinion that this took place after Matthias had been chosen in his room. Others have chosen rather to correct the expression, looking upon it as a mistake <span class="cite-ref">(15)</span> But as we know, that there were <em>twelve </em>in number that were set apart by Christ’s appointment, though one of them had been expunged from the roll, there is no absurdity in supposing that the name was retained. On this principle, there was a body of men at Rome that were called Centumviri, <span class="cite-ref">(16)</span> while they were in number 102. <span class="cite-ref">(17)</span> By <em>the twelve, </em>therefore, you are simply to understand the chosen Apostles. </p><p>It does not quite appear <em>when </em>it was that this <em>appearing to more than five hundred </em>took place. Only it is possible that this large multitude assembled at Jerusalem, when he manifested himself to them. For Luke (<span class="bvs">Luk_24:33</span>) makes mention in a general way of the disciples who had assembled with the eleven; but how many there were he does not say. Chrysostom refers it to the ascension, and explains the word <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπάνω</span> to mean, <em>from on high. </em><span class="cite-ref">(18)</span> Unquestionably, as to what he says in reference to his having appeared to James apart, this may have been subsequently to the ascension. </p><p>By <em>all the Apostles </em>I understand not merely the <em>twelve, </em>but also those disciples to whom Christ had assigned the office of preaching the gospel. <span class="cite-ref">(19)</span> In proportion as our Lord was desirous that there should be many witnesses of his resurrection, and that it should be frequently testified of, let us know that it should be so much the more <em>surely believed among us. </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_1:1</span>.) Farther, inasmuch as the Apostle proves the resurrection of Christ from the fact that he appeared to many, he intimates by this, that it was not figurative but true and natural, for the eyes of the body cannot be witnesses of a spiritual resurrection. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(15)</span><em>Granville Penn </em>supposes that the common reading <span class="lang el-gr">εἶτα τοῖς δώδεκα</span><em>then to the twelve, </em>is a corruption for <span class="lang el-gr">εἶτα τοῖς δε δεκα</span> — <em>and then to the ten, </em>understanding the Apostle as meaning, that Christ appeared first to Cephas, and then to the other <em>ten. </em>Dr. Adam Clarke, after stating that “instead of <span class="lang el-gr">δώδεκα</span><em>, twelve, </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἓνδεκα</span><em>, eleven </em>is the reading of D* E F G, <em>Syriac </em>in the margin, some of the <em>Slavonic, Armenian, Vulgate, Itala, </em>and several of the <em>Fathers,” </em>and that “this reading is supported by <span class="bvs">Mar_16:14</span><em>,” </em>remarks: “Perhaps the term <em>twelve </em>is used here <em>merely </em>to point out the <em>society of the Apostles. </em>who, though at this time they were only <em>eleven, </em>were still called the <em>twelve, </em>because this was their <em>original number, </em>and a number which was <em>afterwards filled up.” </em>“The <em>twelve </em>was a name not of number, but of office. — <em>McKnight. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(16)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, les Cents</span>;” — “That is to say, the Hundred.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(17)</span> The reader will find the same term referred to by Calvin when commenting on <span class="bvs">1Co_10:8</span>. (See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 324, n. 3.) — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(18)</span> “This peculiar use of <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπάνω</span> for <span class="lang el-gr">πλωῖον</span>, (which seems to have been popular or provincial, not being found in the Classical writers,) occurs also in <span class="bvs">Mar_14:5</span>, but with a genitive. Perhaps, however, it has properly no regimen, but is used parenthetically, like the Latin <em>plus trecentos </em><em>, </em>300 and more.” — <em>Bloomfield. </em>The word <span class="lang el-gr">ὠπάνω </span> is used in a similar way in the Septuagint. Thus in <span class="bvs">Exo_30:14</span><span class="lang el-gr">ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς και ἐπάνω </span> — <em>from twenty years old and above, </em>and in <span class="bvs">Lev_27:7</span>, <span class="lang el-gr">ἀπὸ ἑξήκονταἐτῶν και ἐπάνω</span> — <em>from sixty years old and above. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(19)</span> Calvin’s view accords with that of Chrysostom, who says, <span class="lang el-gr">ἦσαν γὰρ καὶ ἄλλοι ἀπόστολοι ὡς ὁι ἑιβδομήκοντα</span> — “for there were also other Apostles, such as the seventy.” — Ed. </p></div></div>
