<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>For I have eaten ashes like bread </em>Some think that the order is here inverted, and that the letter <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>, <em>caph, </em>the sign of similitude, which is put before <span class="lang he-il">לחם</span>, <em>lechem, </em>the word for <em>bread, </em>ought to be placed before <span class="lang he-il">אפר</span>, <em>epher, </em>the word for<em>ashes; </em>as if it had been said, I find no more relish for my bread than I do for ashes; and the reason is, because sorrow of heart produces loathing of food. But the simpler meaning is, that lying prostrate on the ground, they licked, as it were, the earth, <em>and so did eat ashes instead of bread. </em>It was customary for those who mourned to stretch themselves at full length with their faces on the ground. The prophet, however, intended to express a different idea — to intimate, that when he partook of his meals, there was no table set before him, but his bread was thrown upon the ground to him in a foul and disgusting manner. Speaking, therefore, in the person of the faithful, he asserts that he was so fixed to the ground that he did not even rise from it to take his food. The same sentiment is expressed in the last part of the verse<em>, I have mingled my drink with weeping; </em>for while mourners usually restrain their sorrow during the short time in which they refresh themselves with food, he declares that his mourning was without intermission. Some, instead of reading in the first clause, <em>as bread, </em>read, <em>in bread; </em><span class="cite-ref">(144)</span> and as the two letters, <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>, <em>caph, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, <em>beth, </em>nearly resemble each other, I prefer reading <em>in bread, </em>which agrees better with the second clause. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(144)</span> Supposing the reading to be <span class="lang he-il">בלחם</span>, <em>balechem</em>, instead of <span class="lang he-il">כלחם</span>, <em>calechem</em>; and from the similarity in form between the letters <span class="lang he-il">ב</span> and <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>, transcribers might readily have mistaken the latter for the former. </p></div></div>
