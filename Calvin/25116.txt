<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_5:8</span><strong>.</strong><em>Depart from me, O Lord. </em>Although men are earnest in seeking the presence of God, yet, as soon as God appears, they must be struck with terror, and almost rendered lifeless by dread and alarm, until he administers consolation. They have the best reason for calling earnestly on God, because they cannot avoid feeling that they are miserable, while he is absent from them: and, on the other hand, his presence is appalling, because they begin to feel that they are nothing, and that they are overpowered by an immense mass of evils. In this manner, Peter views Christ with reverence in the miracle, and yet is so overawed by his majesty, that he does all he can to avoid his presence. Nor was this the case with Peter alone: for we learn, from the context, that <em>astonishment had overpowered all who were with him. </em>Hence we see, that it is natural to all men to tremble at the presence of God. And this is of advantage to us, in order to humble any foolish confidence or pride that may be in us, provided it is immediately followed by soothing consolation. And so Christ relieves the mind of Peter by a mild and friendly reply, <em>saying to him, Fear not. </em>Thus Christ sinks his own people in the grave, that he may afterwards raise them to life. <span class="cite-ref">(339)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(339)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et c'est la coustume du Seigneur d'abbattre les siens, et comme les plonger dedans le sepulcher, afin de les vivifier puis apres</span>.” — “And it is customary with the Lord to strike down his own people, and, as it were, to sink them in the grave, that he may raise them to life afterwards.” </p></div></div>
