<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>This I pray that your love </em>He returns to the prayer, which he had simply touched upon in one word in passing. He states, accordingly, the sum of those things which he asked from God in their behalf, that they also may learn to pray after his example, and may aspire at proficiency in those gifts. The view taken by some, as though the <em>love of the Philippians </em>denoted the Philippians themselves, as illiterate persons are accustomed very commonly to say, “Your reverence,” — “Your paternity,” is absurd. For no instance of such an expression occurs in the writings of Paul, nor had such fooleries come into use. Besides, the statement would be less complete, and, independently of this, the simple and natural meaning of the words suits admirably well. For the true attainments of Christians are when they make progress in <em>knowledge</em>, and <em>understanding</em>, and afterwards in <em>love</em>. Accordingly the particle <em>in</em>, according to the idiom of the Hebrew tongue, is taken here to mean <em>with</em>, as I have also rendered it, unless perhaps one should prefer to explain it as meaning <em>by</em>, so as to denote the instrument or formal cause. For, the greater proficiency we make in <em>knowledge</em>, so much the more ought our <em>love </em>to increase. The meaning in that case would be, “That your love may increase according to the measure of knowledge.” <em>All knowledge</em>, means what is full and complete — not a knowledge of all things. <span class="cite-ref">(48)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(48)</span> “The word rendered <em>judgment </em>is capable of being rendered <em>sense </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">πάσὟ αἰσθήσει</span>) <em>in all sense. </em>‘I pray that you may have your spiritual senses in excerise — that you may have a judicious distinguishing sense.’ For what?
