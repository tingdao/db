<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>According to the power </em>In the <em>first </em>place, he arms the strictness of which he speaks, with the authority of God, that it may not appear to be thunder without lightning, or a rashly excited onset. <span class="cite-ref">(970)</span> Farther, he lets them know, that he would rather employ his power to another purpose, for which it was peculiarly designed — the promoting of their edification. “I shall not rashly have recourse to cruel remedies, nor will I give indulgence to my passion, but will simply execute the commission that the Lord has given me.” </p><p>When he speaks of <em>power given him for edification, and not for destruction, </em>he employs these terms for a somewhat different purpose from what he had done previously in <span class="bvs">2Co_10:8</span>. For in that passage there was a commendation of the Gospel from the advantage it yields — because what is for our advantage is wont to be agreeable, and is willingly received by us. Here, however, he simply means to declare, that although he might justly inflict upon the Corinthians a severe blow, yet it was much more his inclination to exercise his power for their <em>advantage, </em>than for their <em>destruction </em>— the former being its proper design. For as the Gospel, in its own nature, is the <em>power of God unto salvation, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_1:16</span>,) and an <em>odor of life unto life, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_2:15</span>,) but in a way of contingency, is an <em>odor of death; </em>so the authority, which is conferred upon the Ministers of it, ought to be salutary to the hearers. If, on the other hand, it turns out to their condemnation, that is contrary to its nature. The meaning, therefore, is this: “Do not, through your own fault, allow <em>that </em>to turn to your destruction, which God has appointed for salvation.” In the mean time, the Apostle admonishes all pastors by his example, in what manner they should limit the use of their power. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(970)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Vne escarmouche d’vn homme qui se soit cnflambe sans raison</span>;” — “A skirmishing on the part of a man who has kindled himself up without any just cause.” </p></div></div>
