<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>I have commanded my sanctified ones. </em><span class="cite-ref">(198)</span> Here the Prophet introduces the Lord as speaking and issuing his commands. He calls the Medes and Persians <em>sanctified ones</em>, that is, those whom he has <em>prepared</em>. The verb <span class="lang he-il">קדש</span> (<em>kadash</em>) is used in various senses; for sometimes it refers to the spirit of regeneration, and this belongs peculiarly to the elect of God. But sometimes it means to <em>wish </em>or <em>prepare</em>, and that meaning is more appropriate to this passage. All who are created by the Lord are likewise <em>appointed </em>by him for a fixed purpose. He does not throw down men at random on the earth, to go wherever they please, but guides all by his secret purpose, and regulates and controls the violent passions of the reprobate, so as to drive them in whatever manner he thinks fit, and to check and restrain them according to his pleasure. He therefore calls them <em>sanctified ones</em>, “set apart and prepared to execute his will,” though they had no such intention. Hence also we are taught to ascribe to the secret judgment of God all violent commotions, and this yields wonderful consolation; for whatever attempts may be made by wicked men, yet they will accomplish nothing but what the Lord has decreed. </p><p><em>I have also called my mighty ones. </em>The phrase, <em>I have called</em>, conveys more than the phrase, <em>I have commanded</em>, which he had used in the former clause. It means that they will be roused to action, not only at the bidding of God, but by the very sound of his voice; as if I were to <em>call </em>a person to me, and he were immediately to follow. He threatens, therefore, that <em>Babylon </em>shall be destroyed by the Medes and Persians, in the same manner as if they obeyed the call of God; for though they were prompted to battle by their own ambition, pride, and cruelty, yet God directed them, without knowing it, to execute his judgment. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(198)</span> “<em>My appointed ones</em>. ” <span class="lang he-il">קדש</span> (<em>kadash</em>) is to select and set apart for a work, particularly for one of God’s appointment.
