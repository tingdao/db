<div class="comment-content"><p>But God, on the contrary, says, <em>Behold I will </em>come <em>to thee, </em>or<em>against thee, </em>and <em>will visit </em>thee. There is, indeed, a change of number; for he says, <em>I will visit you, </em>for he had begun by saying, “Ye who say,” <span class="lang he-il">האמרים</span>, <em>eamrim. I will visit upon you, </em>he says, <em>the fruit of your doings; </em>that is, </p><p>“I will deal with you according to what you have done, as your works deserve.” Merit is to be taken for reward. Then God threatens that he would render to the Jews what they merited, because they had not ceased to provoke his wrath. </p><p>He adds, lastly, <em>I will kindle a fire in its forest </em>Some take “forest” metaphorically for the neighboring towns; but this seems foreign to the Prophet’s meaning. I do not, indeed, deny but that there is a metaphor in the words; but then the word forest is not to be applied to towns and villages, but to the buildings of the city itself, according to a mode of speaking elsewhere used by the Prophets. As their houses were built of a large quantity of wood, of tall and most choice trees, the Prophet compares this mass of wood to a forest. We may, however, give a simpler explanation, and I know not whether it be more suitable that the Prophet points out Lebanon. He then means by the <em>forest </em>of the city the trees of Lebanon, which we know were particularly fine, for their loftiness were everywhere known; and we know also that they were very large. As, then, a part of their false glory was Mount Lebanon, the Prophet distinctly intimates that it would serve as a help to burn the city itself; for when God burned Jerusalem, he would take from the vicinity materials for the purpose. <span class="cite-ref">(31)</span></p><p>Now, as we understand the meaning of the Prophet, let us learn how to apply this passage. We have said elsewhere that nothing is more hateful to God than false confidence; when men, relying on their own resources, promise to themselves a happy and a safe condition, they become torpid in their own security. Thus it comes, that they despise God, and never flee to him; they scorn his judgments, and at length are carried away by a mad impulse to every kind of insolence. This is the reason why the Prophets so often and so sharply reprove secure men, for they become presumptuous towards God when they are touched by no regard for him, and with no fear of him. They then not only dishonor God by transferring the hope of their safety to mere means or such helps as they foolishly depend on, but they also think that they are not under the authority of God. Hence it is, that they promise themselves impunity, and thus become wholly hardened in their sins. Now follows — </p><p><strong>(31)</strong> “The Word ‘forest’ is often metaphorically taken for a city in the prophetical writings, because its stately buildings, or its principal inhabitants, resemble tall cedars standing in their several ranks. See <span class="bvs">Jer_22:7</span>; <span class="bvs">Isa_37:24</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_20:46</span>; Zecheriah. 11:1.” — <em>Lowth</em>. </p></div>
