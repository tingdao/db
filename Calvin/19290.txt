<div class="comment-content"><p>God declares in this verse, that the people were so hardened in their wickedness, that there was no hope of their repentance. This is the sum of what is said. But it was a very bitter reproof for the Prophet to say that his own nation were past hope — that they had so entirely given themselves up to their vices that they were no longer healable. </p><p>But he uses a comparison<em>, </em>— <em>Can the Ethiopian, </em><span class="cite-ref">(94)</span> he says, <em>change his skin? </em>Blackness is inherent in the skin of the Ethiopians, as it is well known. Were they then to wash themselves a hundred times daily, they could not put off their blackness. The same also must be said of leopards or panthers, and we know that these animals are besprinkled with spots. Such then is the spotted character of the leopard or panther, <span class="cite-ref">(95)</span> that whatever might be done to him he would still retain his color. We now then see what the Prophet means — that the Jews were so corrupted by long habit that they could not repent, for the devil had so enslaved them that they were not in their right mind; they no longer had any discernment, and could not discriminate between good and evil. </p><p>Learned men in our age do not wisely refer to this passage, when they seek to prove that there is no free-will in man; for it is not simply the nature of man that is spoken of here, but the habit that is contracted by long practice. Aristotle, a strong advocate of free will, confesses that it is not in man’s power to do right, when he is so immersed in his own vices as to have lost a free choice, (<em>7. Lib. Ethicon) </em>and this also is what experience proves. We hence see that this passage is improperly adduced to prove a sentiment which is yet true, and fully confirmed by many passages of Scripture. </p><p>Jeremiah, then, does not here refer to man’s nature as he is when he comes from the womb; but he condemns the Jews for contracting such a habit by long practice. As, then, they had hardened themselves in doing evil, he says that they could not repent, that wickedness had become inherent, or firmly fixed in their hearts, like the blackness which is inherent in the skin of the Ethiopians, or the spots which belong to the leopards or panthers. </p><p>We may at the same time gather from this passage a useful doctrine — that men become so corrupt, by sinful habits and sinful indulgence, that the devil takes away from them every desire and care for acting rightly, so that, in a word, they become wholly irreclaimable, as we see to be the case with regard to bodily diseases; for a chronic disease, in most instances, so corrupts what is sound and healthy in the body, that it becomes by degrees incurable. When, therefore, the body is thus infected for a long time, there is no hope of a cure Life may indeed be prolonged, but not without continual languor. Now, as to spiritual diseases it is also true, that when putridity has pervaded the inward parts, it is impossible for any one to repent. And yet it must be observed, that we do not speak here of the power of God, but only shew, that all those who harden themselves in their vices, as far as their power is concerned, are incurable, and past all remedy. Yet God can deliver, even from the lowest depths, such as have a hundred times past all recovery. But here, as I have already said, the Prophet does not refer to God’s power, but only condemns his own nation, that they might not complain that God treated them with too much severity. </p><p>The meaning then is, that they ought not to have thought it strange that God left them no hope; for they became past recovery, through their own perverseness, as they could not adopt another course of life after having so long accustomed themselves to everything that was evil: <em>Wilt thou also, </em>he says, <em>be able to do good? </em>that is, wilt thou apply thy mind to what is just, <em>who hast been accustomed to evil, </em>or who hast hitherto learnt nothing but to do evil? <span class="cite-ref">(96)</span> We now perceive the design of the Prophet — that they unreasonably sought pardon of God, who had contracted such hardness by a long course of sinning that they were become incurable. It afterwards follows — </p><p><strong>(94)</strong> The word in Hebrew is <em>“Cushite;” </em>and many learned men contend that the “Ethiopian” is not meant, though all the early versions so render it except the <em>Syriac, </em>which has “Indian.” <em>Blayney </em>agrees with <em>Bochart </em>and others in thinking that the Cushites were the inhabitants of Arabia, on the borders of the Red Sea, and he refers in proof of this to <span class="bvs">2Ch_21:16</span>. The skin is not said here to be black, but it was no doubt of a particular color, different from that of the Jews. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(95)</strong> ”Panther,” <span class="lang el-gr">πάρδαλις</span> — pardus, is the rendering of the <em>Septuagint </em>and the other versions. The word rendered “spots,” found only here, is translated “varieties” by the <em>Septuagint </em>and <em>Vulgate, </em>but “spots” by the <em>Syriac </em>and <em>Targum. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(96)</strong> Neither this sentence nor the preceding is put interrogatively in the <em>Septuagint, </em>the <em>Syriac, </em>and the <em>Vulgate, </em>but in this way, — “If the Ethiopian,” etc.; “Even so can ye,” etc. The <em>Arabic </em>and the <em>Targum </em>have both sentences in an interrogative form, and more consistently with the Hebrew. <em>Blayney </em>renders the first part interrogatively, as in our version, but not the second, and he gives a meaning to the second part which the original will not bear, and which is not countenanced by any of the versions. The most literal version is as follows, — </p><p>Can the Cushite change his skin, Or the panther his spots? — Also ye, can ye do good, Who have learned evil? </p><p>The future tense in Hebrew ought often to be rendered potentially, and sometimes subjunctively. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
