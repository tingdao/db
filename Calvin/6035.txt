<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>And he wrote there upon the stones, </em>etc A different rule is applicable to the stones here mentioned, on which God wished that a memorial of his Law should always appear, in order that, a kind of barrier might be interposed to protect the pure religion against the superstitions of Egypt. They were therefore covered with lime, that they might be more conspicuous, and the writing upon them more distinct. I willingly subscribe to the opinion of those who understand by the repeated Law a written form, or what is commonly called a copy or duplicate. I cannot, however, believe that the whole volume was traced upon it; for no stones however large could suffice to contain all the details. I therefore think that by the term Law only its substance and sanctions <span class="cite-ref">(79)</span> are denoted. This made it palpable even to strangers entering the land what God was worshipped in it, and all excuse for error was taken away, when the Law was not treasured up in a book, but made manifest to the eyes of all. In short, though the priests should have been dumb, the stones themselves spoke clearly. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(79)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le sommaire, et les defenses et commandemens</span>;” “The summary, and the prohibitions and commands.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
