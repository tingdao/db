<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_25:15</span><strong>.</strong><em>To every one according to his own ability. </em>By this term Christ does not distinguish between natural gifts and the gifts of the Spirit; for we have neither power nor skill <span class="cite-ref">(688)</span> which ought not to be acknowledged as having been received from God; and, therefore, whoever shall determine to give God his share will leave nothing for himself. What then is meant by saying, that the master of the house gives to each person more or less, <em>according to his own ability? </em>It is because God, as he has assigned to every one his place, and has bestowed on him natural gifts, gives him also this or the other injunction, employs him in the management of affairs, raises him to various offices, furnishes him with abundant means of eminent usefulness, and presents to him the opportunity. </p><p>It is absurd, however, in the Papists to infer from this, that the gifts of God are conferred on every man according to the measure which he deserves. For, though the old translator, <span class="cite-ref">(689)</span> employed the word <em>virtus</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(690)</span> he did not mean that God bestows his gifts, according as men have acquitted themselves well, and obtained the praise of <em>virtue</em>, but only so far as the master of the house has judged them to be suitable. Now we know that no man is found by God to be suitable till He has made him so; and the Greek word <span class="lang el-gr">δύναμις</span>, <em>(power</em>, <em>ability</em>, <em>) </em>which Christ employed, is free from all ambiguity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(688)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’y a ne puissance, ne industrie, ou dexterit</span>;” — “there is neither power, nor industry, nor skill.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(689)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le translateur Latin ancien</span>;” — “the old Latin translator.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(690)</span> An interpreter who was willing to twist a passage, so as to bring out of it any meaning that he chose, would find the vagueness of the Latin word <em>virtus </em> to be well suited to his purpose. Its derivation from <em>vir </em>,<em>a </em>man, shows that it originally signified <em>manliness</em>, from which it easily passed to denote <em>courage</em>, and, from the high estimation in which <em>courage </em>was held among warlike nations, became the general expression for <em>moral excelle </em>n<em>ce</em>, out of which arose the application of it to other kinds of <em>excellence</em>, as in the phrase, <em>virtutes orationis </em>,<em>the ornaments of style</em>. Again, from denoting <em>manly vigor </em>it came naturally to denote <em>ability; </em>and it is undoubtedly in this sense, with which our English version accords, that <em>rirtus </em> is employed by the Vulgate in this passage. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
