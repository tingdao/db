<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_19:23</span><strong>.</strong><em>A rich man will with difficulty enter. </em>Christ warns them, not only how dangerous and how deadly a plague avarice is, but also how great an obstacle is presented by riches. In Mark, indeed, he mitigates the harshness of his expression, by restricting it to those only <em>who place confidence in riches </em>But these words are, I think, intended to confirm, rather than correct, the former statement, as if he had affirmed that they ought not to think it strange, that he made the <em>entrance into the kingdom of heaven so difficult for the rich, </em>because it is an evil almost common to all to <em>trust in their riches </em>Yet this doctrine is highly useful to all; to <em>the rich</em>, that, being warned of their danger, they may be on their guard; to the poor, that, satisfied with their lot, they may not so eagerly desire what would bring more damage than gain. It is true indeed, that <em>riches </em>do not, in their own nature, hinder us from following God; but, in consequence of the depravity of the human mind, it is scarcely possible for those who have a great abundance to avoid being intoxicated by them. So they who are exceedingly <em>rich </em>are held by Satan bound, as it were, in chains, that they may not raise their thoughts to heaven; nay more, they bury and entangle themselves, and became utter slaves to the earth. The comparison of the <em>camel</em>. , which is soon after added, is intended to amplify the <em>difficulty; </em>for it means that <em>the rich </em>are so swelled with pride and presumption, that they cannot endure to be reduced to the straits through which God makes his people to pass. The word <em>camel </em>denotes, I think, a rope used by sailors, rather than the animal so named. <span class="cite-ref">(633)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(633)</span> “ Vray est que le mot CAMELUS, dont a use l’Evangeliste, significant un chameau qu’un chable: mats i’aime mieux le prendre en la derniere signification pour une grosse carde de nayire.” — “It is true that the word <span class="lang el-gr">κάμηλος</span> which the Evangelist has employed, means both a <em>camel </em>and a <em>cable; </em>but I prefer taking it in the latter signification for <em>a large rope used by sailors</em>. ” The two English words <em>camel </em>and <em>cable </em>closely resemble each other, and the corresponding Greek words differ only by a single vowel; <span class="lang el-gr">κάμηλος</span>, denoting a <em>camel</em>, and <span class="lang el-gr">κάμιλος</span> a <em>cable </em>or <em>rope </em>It does not appear that Calvin; relied on certain Manuscripts of no good authority, which substitute <span class="lang el-gr">καμίλον</span>, for <span class="lang el-gr">καμήλον</span>. But he adopted the notion equally unfounded, that Greek writers sometimes used <span class="lang el-gr">κάμηλος</span>, in the sense of <span class="lang el-gr">κάμιλος</span>. Had due allowance been made for the boldness of Eastern imagery, the supposed difficulty would have disappeared, and the most refined taste would have been fully gratified. The poet Southey has seized the true spirit of the passage: — “S. The <em>camel </em>and the <em>needle</em>, Is that then in your mind? “T. Even so. The text Is gospel wisdom. I would ride the <em>camel</em>, — Yea leap him flying, through the <em>needle’s eye</em>, As easily as such a pampered soul Could pass the narrow gate.” At one period, critics showed a strong leaning to the idea of <em>cable</em>, which our Author favors, but have now very generally abandoned it, and returned to the true <em>reading</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
