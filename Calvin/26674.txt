<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>I am the way. </em>Though Christ does not give a direct reply to the question put to him, yet he passes by nothing that is useful to be known. It was proper that Thomas’ curiosity should be checked; and, therefore, Christ does not explain what would be his condition when he should have departed out of this world to go to the Father, <span class="cite-ref">(62)</span> but dwells on a subject far more necessary. Thomas would gladly have heard what Christ intended to do in heaven, as we never become weary of those intricate speculations; but it is of greater importance to us to employ our study and labor in another inquiry, how we may become partakers of the blessed resurrection. The statement amounts to this, that whoever obtains Christ is ill want of nothing; and, therefore, that whoever is not satisfied with Christ alone, strives after something beyond absolute perfection. </p><p><em>The way, the truth, and the life. </em>He lays down three degrees, as if he had said, that he is the beginning, and the middle, and the end; and hence it follows that we ought to begin with him, to continue in him, and to end in him. We certainly ought not to seek for higher wisdom than that which leads us to eternal <em>life, </em>and he testifies that this <em>life </em>is to be found in him. Now the method of obtaining <em>life </em>is, to become new creatures. He declares, that we ought not to seek it anywhere else, and, at the same time, reminds us, that <em>he is the way</em>, by which alone we can arrive at it. That he may not fail us in any respect, he stretches out the hand to those who are going astray, and stoops so low as to guide sucking infants. Presenting himself as a leader, he does not leave his people in the middle of the course, but makes them partakers of <em>the truth</em>. At length he makes them enjoy the fruit of it, which is the most excellent and delightful thing that can be imagined. </p><p>As Christ is <em>the way</em>, the weak and ignorant have no reason to complain that they are forsaken by him; and as he is <em>the truth and the life, </em>he has in himself also what is fitted to satisfy the most perfect. In short, Christ now affirms, concerning happiness, what I have lately said concerning the object of faith. All believe and acknowledge that the happiness of man lies in God alone: but they afterwards go wrong in this respect, that, seeking God elsewhere than in Christ, they tear him — so to speak — from his true and solid Dignity. </p><p><em>The truth </em>is supposed by some to denote here the saving light of heavenly wisdom, and by others to denote the substance of <em>life </em>and of all spiritual blessings, which is contrasted with shadows and figures; as it is said, <em>grace and truth came by Jesus Christ</em>, (<span class="bvs">Joh_1:17</span>.) My opinion is, that <em>the truth </em>means here the perfection of faith as <em>the way </em>means its beginning and first elements. The whole may be summed up thus: “If any man turn aside from Christ, he will do nothing but go astray; if any man do not rest on him, he will feed elsewhere on nothing but wind and vanity; if any man, not satisfied with him alone, wishes to go farther, <span class="cite-ref">(63)</span> he will find death instead of life.” </p><p><em>No man cometh to the Father. </em>This is an explanation of the former statement’, for he is <em>the way</em>, because he leads us <em>to the Father</em>, and he is <em>the truth </em>and<em>the life</em>, because in him we perceive <em>the Father</em>. As to calling on God, it may indeed be said, with truth, that no prayers are heard but through the intercession of Christ; but as Christ does not now speak about prayer, we ought simply to understand the meaning to be, that men contrive for themselves true labyrinths, whenever, after having forsaken Christ, they attempt <em>to come to God</em>. For Christ proves that he is <em>the life</em>, because God, <em>with whom is the fountain of life</em>, (<span class="bvs">Psa_36:9</span>,) cannot be enjoyed in any other way than in Christ. Wherefore all theology, when separated from Christ, is not only vain and confused, but is also mad, deceitful, and spurious; for, though the philosophers sometimes utter excellent sayings, yet they have nothing but what is short-lived, and even mixed up with wicked and erroneous sentiments. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(62)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand il seroit parti hors de ce monde pour aller a son Pere</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(63)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si quel qu’un ne se contentant point de luy seul, vent passer outre</span>.” </p></div></div>
