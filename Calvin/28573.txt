<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Now these things were types to us. </em>He warns us in still more explicit terms, that we have to do with the punishment that was inflicted upon them, so that they are a lesson to us, that we may not provoke the anger of God as they did. “God,” says he, “in punishing them has set before us, as in a picture, his severity, that, instructed by their example, we may learn to fear.” Of the term <em>type </em>I shall speak presently. Only for the present I should wish my readers to know, that it is not without consideration that I have given a different rendering from that of the old translation, <span class="cite-ref">(540)</span> and of Erasmus.

I am of opinion, that the history that is here referred to is what is recorded in <span class="bvs">Num_11:4</span>, etc., though others refer it to what is recorded in <span class="bvs">Num_26:64</span>. The people, after having been for some time fed with manna, at length took a dislike to it, and began to desire other kinds of food, which they had been accustomed to partake of in Egypt. Now they sinned in two ways, for they despised the peculiar gift of God, and they eagerly longed after a variety of meats and delicacies, contrary to the will of God. The Lord, provoked by this lawless appetite, inflicted upon the people a grievous blow. Hence the place was called the </p><p>graves of lust, <span class="cite-ref">(541)</span> because there they buried those whom <LineBreak />the Lord had smitten. (<span class="bvs">Num_11:34</span>.) </p><p>The Lord by this example testified how much he hates those lusts that arise from dislike of his gifts, and from our lawless appetite, for whatever goes beyond the measure that God has prescribed is justly reckoned evil and unlawful. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(540)</span> The rendering of the Vulgate <em>is </em>— <em>in figura </em> — (<em>in figure</em>.)
