<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_3:10</span><strong>; </strong><span class="bvs">Luk_3:9</span><strong>.</strong><em>And now also the axe. </em>After having stripped hypocrites of the covering of a vain confidence, John announces the approaching judgment of God. He had formerly said that, though they were rejected, God would not want a people: and he now adds, that God is just about to drive out unworthy persons from the Church, as barren <em>trees </em>are wont to be <em>cut down. </em>His statement amounts to this, that God has already displayed his power for purifying the Church. The grace of God is never manifested for the salvation of the godly, till his judgment first appears for the destruction of the world: and for two reasons; because God then separates his own people from the reprobate, and because his wrath is kindled anew by the ingratitude of the world. So that we have no reason to wonder, if the preaching of the gospel and the coming of Christ laid <em>the axe </em>for <em>cutting down </em>barren trees, or if the same causes <span class="cite-ref">(271)</span> daily advance the wrath of God against the wicked. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(271)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ces deux choses mesme</span>;” — “these very two things.” </p></div></div>
