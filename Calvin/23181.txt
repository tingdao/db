<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>They found the young child </em>So revolting a sight might naturally have created an additional prejudice; for Christ was so far from having aught of royalty surrounding him, that he was in a meaner and more despised condition than any peasant child. But they are convinced that he is divinely appointed to be a King. This thought alone, deeply rooted in their minds, procures their reverence. They contemplate in the purpose of God his exalted rank, which is still concealed from outward view. <span class="cite-ref">(186)</span> Holding it for certain, that he will one day be different from what he now appears, they are not at all ashamed to render to him the honors of royalty. </p><p>Their presents show whence they came: for there can be no doubt that they brought them as the choicest productions of their country. We are not to understand, that each of them presented his own offering, but that the three offerings, which are mentioned by Matthew, were presented by all of them in common. Almost all the commentators indulge in speculations about those gifts, as denoting the kingdom, priesthood, and burial of Christ. They make <em>gold </em>the symbol of his <em>kingdom, </em>— <em>frankincense, </em>of his <em>priesthoods</em>, — and <em>myrrh, </em>of his <em>burial</em>. I see no solid ground for such an opinion. It was customary, we know, among the Persians, when they offered homage to their kings, to bring a present in their hands. The Magi select those three for the produce of which Eastern countries are celebrated; just as Jacob sent into Egypt the choicest and most esteemed productions of the soil. </p><p>“Take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Gen_43:11</span>.) </p><p>Again, in rendering homage, according to the custom of Persia, to him whom they still regarded as an earthly King, they offered the productions of the soil. Our duty is, to adore him in a spiritual manner: for the lawful and reasonable worship which he demands is, that we consecrate first ourselves, and then all that we have, to his service. </p><p><strong>(186)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car ils considerent et contemplent au conseil de Dieu sa dignite et magnificence royale, laquelle n'apparoissoit point encores</span>;” — “for they consider and contemplate in the purpose of God his royal dignity and splendor, which did not yet appear,” </p></div>
