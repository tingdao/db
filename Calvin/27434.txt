<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>As the disciples. </em>Though no man defended Paul, yet Luke showeth that the godly were desirous of his life;<span class="cite-ref">(42)</span> yet they did so moderate themselves, lest they should attempt anything with great danger to no end, seeing they could not help him unless it were done privily. And surely we must always mark what the Lord hath brought to our hand. If I, standing upon the bank, shall see a man in the midst of the water, and cannot reach him my hand when he is like to be drowned,<span class="cite-ref">(43)</span> what is remaining for me to do but to commend him to the Lord? And [but] if there be any hope to help him, then must I endanger myself.<span class="cite-ref">(44)</span> Therefore, we will not say that Saint Paul was left alone by the disciples through sloth, seeing they could not help him; and they declare their love and care when they stand about him after he is cast out.</p><p><em>They went to Derbe </em>It appeareth plainly by this that Paul was miraculously saved, seeing that, on the morrow, after he was cast out for dead, he taketh his journey, being fresh and sound; whence it is also gathered what an invincible heart he bare against all evils and afflictions. For he creepeth not into a corner, where, like an overworn soldier, he may live idly; but he goeth to the same places where he was uncourteously and cruelly handled but a little before. Notwithstanding Luke showeth that the church was first planted among the men of Derbe, he addeth afterward, that Paul and Barnabas returned unto the churches which they had ordained, that they might confirm the disciples; whereby by he giveth us to understand that the use of the Word consisteth not in instruction only, whereby the hearer is only taught, but that it is also available for confirmation of faith, in admonishing, exhorting, and reproving. And Christ doth not only command his ministers to teach, but also to exhort; and Paul saith that the Scripture is profitable not only to teach, but also to exhort, ( <span class="bvs">Tit_3:16</span>.) Wherefore, let not pastors think that they have done their duty as they ought, when they have well trained up their people in true knowledge, unless they employ themselves to this part also. Again, let not the faithful neglect the Word of God, as if the reading and preaching thereof were unnecessary; because there is no man who hath not need of continual confirmation.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(42)</span></p><p>“ De ejus vita sollicitos,” were anxious for his life. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(43)</span></p><p>“ Naufrago,” when shipwrecked. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(44)</span></p><p>“ Periculum subire,” run the risk. </p></div></div>
