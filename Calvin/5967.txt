<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And the city shall be accursed, </em>etc Although God had determined not only to enrich his people with spoil and plunder, but also to settle them in cities which they had not built, yet there was a peculiarity in the case of the first city; for it was right that it should be consecrated as a kind of first fruits. Accordingly, he claims the buildings, as well as all the moveable property, as his own, and prohibits the application of any part of it to private uses. It may have been an irksome and grievous task for the people voluntarily to pull down houses in which they might have commodiously dwelt, and to destroy articles which might have been important for use. But as they had not been required to fight, it behooved them to refrain, without grudging, from touching the prey, and willingly yield up the rewards of the victory to God, as it was solely by his nod that the walls of the city had fallen, and the courage of the citizens had fallen along with them. God was contented with this pledge of gratitude, provided the people thereby quickly learned that everything they called their own was the gift of his free liberality. For with equal right all the other cities might have been doomed to destruction, had not God granted them to his people for habitations. </p><p>As to the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">חרס</span>, I will now only briefly repeat from other passages. When it refers to sacred oblations, it becomes, in respect of men, equivalent to <em>abolitions, </em>since things devoted in this manner are renounced by them as completely as if they were annihilated. The equivalent Greek term is<span class="lang el-gr">ἀνάθημα</span><em>, </em>or <span class="lang el-gr">ἀνάθεμα</span><em>, </em>meaning <em>set apart, </em>or as it is properly expressed in French, <em>interdicted. </em>Hence the exhortation to beware of what was under anathema, inasmuch as that which had been set apart for God alone had perished, in so far as men were concerned. It is used in a different sense in the following verse, where caution is given not to place the camp of Israel in anathema. Here its simple meaning is, excision, perdition, or death. Moreover, God destined vessels made of metals for the use of the sanctuary; all other things he ordered to be consumed by fire, or destroyed in other manners. </p></div>
