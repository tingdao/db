<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>49.</strong><em>Now they that died in the plague. </em>Already three hundred, or thereabouts, had been destroyed on account of the conspiracy made with Korah; now a much larger number was added. And this, forsooth, is what the wicked reap from their obstinacy, that God being more and more provoked redoubles His punishments; even as He threatens that, unless those whom He chastises shall repent, he will deal “seven times more” severely with them. (<span class="bvs">Lev_26:18</span>.) Wherefore let us learn, when we are warned by His rebukes, to humble ourselves betimes beneath His mighty hand, since nothing is worse than to kick against the pricks; and let us always bear in mind what the psalm says, </p><p>“Be ye not as the horse or as the mute, whose mouth must be held with bit and bridle; (because) many sorrows shall be to the wicked.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_32:9</span>.) </p><p>They rebelliously exclaimed that the people of the Lord were slain, when three hundred had perished; they now experience how much better it would have been to be dumb before God, and to give glory to His holy severity, than, instead of three hundred, to devote to destruction nearly fifty times as many. Let us, then, remember the admonition of Paul: </p><p>“Let us beware lest we murmur, lest perchance the destroyer should destroy us,” <span class="cite-ref">(102)</span> (<span class="bvs">1Co_10:10</span>;) </p><p>for nothing is less tolerable in us than that we should frowardly presume to speak evil of God, when Scripture so often exhorts us to be silent in His presence. </p><p><strong>(102)</strong> It will be seen that he gives the substance, and not the actual words, of St. Paul’s exhortation. </p></div>
