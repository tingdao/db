<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh, etc. </em>This comparison has several parts: the first is, that if we showed so much reverence to the fathers from whom we have descended according to the flesh, as to submit to their discipline, much more honor is due to God who is our spiritual Father; another is, that the discipline which fathers use as to their children is only useful for the present life, but that God looks farther, having in view to prepare us for an eternal life; and the third is, that men chastise their children as it seems good to them, but that God regulates his discipline in the best manner, and with perfect wisdom, so that there is nothing in it but what is duly ordered. He then, in the first place, makes this difference between God and men, that they are the fathers of the flesh, but he of the spirit; and on this difference he enlarges by comparing the flesh with the spirit. </p><p>But it may be asked, Is not God the Father also of our flesh? For it is not without reason that Job mentions the creation of men as one of the chief miracles of God: hence on this account also he is justly entitled to the name of Father. Were we to say that he is called the Father of spirits, because he alone creates and regenerates our souls without the aid of man, it might be said again that Paul glories in being the spiritual father of those whom he had begotten in Christ by the Gospel. To these things I reply, that God is the Father of the body as well as of the soul, and, properly speaking, he is indeed the only true Father; and that this name is only as it were by way of concession applied to men, both in regard of the body and of the soul. As, however, in creating souls, he does use the instrumentality of men, and as he renews them in a wonderful manner by the power of the Spirit, he is peculiarly called, by way of eminence, the Father of spirits. <span class="cite-ref">(250)</span></p><p>When he says, <em>and we gave them reverence, </em>he refers to a feeling implanted in us by nature, so that we honor parents even when they treat us harshly. By saying, <em>in subjection to the Father of spirits, </em>he intimates that it is but just to concede to God the authority he has over us by the right of a Father. By saying, <em>and live, </em>he points out the cause or the end, for the conjunction “and” is to be rendered <em>that, </em>— “that we may live.” Now we are reminded by this word <em>live, </em>that there is nothing more ruinous to us than to refuse to surrender ourselves in obedience to God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(250)</span> Here is an instance, among many others, in which men’s ingenuity is allowed unnecessarily to involve things in difficulties. The comparison here is founded on two palpable facts: there are fathers of our flesh, i.e., the body, and they have for a short time a duty to perform as such; but God, being the Father of our Spirits, which are to continue forever, deals with us in a way corresponding to our destiny. The question of instrumentality has nothing to do with the subject. Nor can anything be fairly drawn from this passage as to the useless question of the non-traduction of souls, as some have thought; and it may be justly be called useless, as it is a question beyond the range of human inquiry. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
