<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>But fornication. </em>This chapter, and the <span class="bvs">Col_3:0</span>, contain many parallel passages, which an intelligent reader will be at no loss to compare without my assistance. Three things are here enumerated, which the apostle desires Christians to hold in such abhorrence, that they shall not even be named, or, in other words, shall be entirely unknown among them. By <em>uncleanness </em>he means all base and impure lusts; so that this word differs from <em>fornication, </em>only as the whole class differs from a single department. The third is <em>covetousness, </em>which is nothing more than an immoderate desire of gain. To this precept he adds the authoritative declaration, that he demands nothing from them but that which <em>becometh saints, </em>â€” manifestly excluding from the number and fellowship of the saints all fornicators, and impure and covetous persons. </p></div>
