<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>42</strong><em>I will make my arrows drunk with blood. </em>In these words He describes a horrible massacre, as though He had said, There shall be no end to my vengeance, until the earth shall be full of blood and corpses. Elsewhere <span class="cite-ref">(296)</span> also, God’s sword is said to be “drunk with blood,” as here His arrows, when His wrath proceeds to inflict great acts of carnage; and in the same sense it is here said to “devour flesh.” </p><p>The second <span class="lang he-il">מדם</span>, <em>midam, </em>some render, “on account of the blood;” and I admit that <span class="lang he-il">מ</span>, <em>mem, </em>is sometimes the causalparticle. They understand it, then, that this would be the just recompense of their cruelty, when the wicked, who had slain the Israelites, or led them away captive, should be cut off by God. But I do not see why the same word should be expounded in two different senses; and I have no doubt but that it is a repetition of the same thing, that God will make His “arrows drunk with blood;” <span class="cite-ref">(297)</span> but He says, “the blood both of the slain and of the captives,” since, when an army is put to the sword, some fall in the battle itself, whilst others, maimed and wounded, make an effort to escape. </p><p>The conclusion of the verse is twisted into various senses; some expound the word “head” by change of number, “heads,” as though it were said, “I will cut off the heads of the enemies;” it would, however, be more plausible to apply it metaphorically to the leaders. But others translate it more correctly, “the beginning,” not, indeed, with reference to time, but as though it were said, the flower, or best of the multitude, according to the common phrase, “from the first to the last.” My interpretation of “the revenges of the enemy” is, not those which God will inflict upon His enemies, but such as are capital, or deadly, as though He had said that He would deal as an enemy with the wicked, so that there should be no place for mercy. <span class="cite-ref">(298)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(296)</span><span class="bvs">Jer_46:10</span>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(297)</span> Addition in <em>Fr., </em>“pour confermer le propos avee plus grand vehemence;” to confirm the point in question with greater vehemence. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(298)</span><span class="lang he-il">מראש פרעות אויב</span><em>A.V</em>. , “From the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.” <em>S.M</em>. ,”From the head of revenges of the enemy.” <em>V</em>. and Luther,” Of the bare head of the enemies.’ <em>LXX., </em>“From the head of the chief enemies.” The word <span class="lang he-il">ראש</span> is either the <em>head </em>of a body, or the <em>beginning of </em>an event. <span class="lang he-il">פרעות</span> comes from a verb signifying to <em>deal out retribution, </em>and has therefore been taken by some to mean <em>revenge, </em>and by others to mean <em>chiefs </em>or <em>rulers, </em>whose office it is to avenge wrongs; there are, however, instances in which <span class="lang he-il">פרע</span> is acknowledged to be the <em>hair of the head. </em>—<em>W. </em></p></div></div>
