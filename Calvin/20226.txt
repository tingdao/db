<div class="comment-content"><p>The word <span class="lang he-il">שכנתי</span>, <em>shekenti, </em>is to be taken here for <span class="lang he-il">שכנת</span>, <em>shekenet, </em>a dweller; and the passage is more clear when we take it as the title of Babylon. And he says that she was <em>a dweller among waters, </em>because the Euphrates not only flowed by the city, (and we know that it was a very large river,) but it surrounded it; and it, was indeed divided above Babylon into many streams, so that it made as it were many islands, and thus access to the city was more difficult. This circumstance served not only for a defense to it, but also for other advantages.: For these streams or channels were navigable; and the land also was made more fertile by the irrigation they supplied. Thus these streams contributed to its wealth as well as to its defense in time of war. And though Babylon was deemed on this account impregnable, and was also a very fertile land, yet the Prophet says here that its <em>end was come </em></p><p>Now, except he had made this preface, that Babylon was situated among the rivers or many waters, and that it was also a city full of wealth, all this might have seemed a hindrance to prevent God from executing on it his vengeance; for this objection was ready at hand, “How can Babylon be taken, which is seated between many waters? for without great force and number of soldiers it cannot but remain in safety, since it is protected by so many rivers.” Then another objection might have been brought forward, that Babylon was an opulent city, so that it could hire auxiliaries on every side, and that having such abundance of money, it would never be unprotected. Hence the Prophet here mentions these two things; but what he says ought to be taken adversatively, as if he said, “Though thou dwellest among many waters, and art great in treasures, that is, hast large treasures, yet <em>thine end is come.” </em></p><p>He adds, <em>the measure of thy cupidity</em>. Some render <span class="lang he-il">אמת</span>, <em>amet, </em>“<em>end</em>, ” but improperly; and the Prophet has not without reason introduced the word <span class="lang he-il">אמת</span>, <em>amet, </em>which properly means a cubit, but is to be taken here for measure. <em>Jerome </em>renders it “a foot,” a word in use in his age. But the meaning is sufficiently clear, that though Babylon had exhausted all the wealth of the world as an insatiable gulf, yet <em>the measure of her cupidity </em>would come. For the cupidity of that nation was unlimited, but God at length brought it to an end — not that they were amended, but that God checked their coveting. And according to this sense the Prophet says, that though they had been hitherto devouring the wealth of many countries, yet the <em>measure of her cupidity was come, </em>even because the Lord would take away, together with the monarchy, the power and opportunity of doing wrong. For the Chaldeans were able to act licentiously, when they had so many nations subject to them; but the <em>measure </em>of their cupidity was come, when God in a manner cut off their strength, not that they then desisted, or that their rapacious disposition was amended — for they changed not their nature; but cupidity is to be referred here to its exercise, even because their power was then taken from them, so that they could not carry on their plunders as they had used to do. He afterwards adds, — </p></div>
