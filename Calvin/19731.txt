<div class="comment-content"><p>He afterwards adds, <em>Yet go forth shall the line of measure before him </em>Some apply this to the gate, because from the gate the line was to be extended to <em>the hill Gareb, and go round to Goath </em>Of these names of places I cannot say much, for we do not know the ancient situation of the city; and the Jews themselves, when they make conjectures about these uncertain things, shew only their own ignorance. However, the greater part of interpreters understand this, — that the city was to be large, as though God promised that he would extend it beyond the walls; and this they illicit from the verb <span class="lang he-il">יצא</span><em>itsa, go forth shall the line, </em>or cord, <em>of measure </em>But when the Prophet says <em>yet, </em>he compares the ancient greatness of the city with that which he perceives it to be hereafter. Then Zechariah seems to promise that it would be such a city as would contain the same measure; for he says, </p><p>“Inhabited shall the city be under itself,” </p><p>or in its own place. (<span class="bvs">Zec_12:6</span>) As then Zechariah promises that the city would occupy the same place as formerly, I do not conclude anything else from the words of our Prophet, especially as the particle <em>yet </em>intimates the same thing. When it is said <em>before him, </em>I apply this to God and not to the gate; for mention is previously made of God, <em>Built shall be the city to Jehovah; </em>and then he adds, <em>before him </em>I have no doubt but that the Prophet here bids the Israelites to raise up their eyes to God, that they might expect from him what was incredible according to the comprehension of men and of the flesh: then <em>before him, </em>that is, when God restores the city, then <em>Go forth shall the line, </em>that is, he will extend the line to <em>the hill Gareb, and surround Goath </em></p></div>
