<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29</strong><em>If a man or woman. </em>What is here spoken of is not the baldness which so often occurs in old age; but that loss of hair, which is the consequence of leprosy, is distinguished from any other, the cause of which may be some indisposition, and which yet does not pollute a man. But, inasmuch as some kinds of baldness do not so greatly differ at first sight from leprosy, — such, for instance, as <em>ophiasis </em>and <em>alopecia </em><span class="cite-ref">(8)</span> — it is therefore necessary to distinguish them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(8)</span> “Ophiasis, (<span class="lang el-gr">ὀφιασις </span><em>Gr.</em>,) a disease, in which the hair grows thin, and falls off, leaving the parts smooth and winding like the folds of a serpent.” </p><p>"Alopecia, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀλωπεκια </span> of <span class="lang el-gr">ἀλωπηξ</span>, a fox, <em>Gr., </em>the fox-evil,) a disease called the scurf, when the hairs fall from the head by the <em>roots. </em>” — <em>Bailey’s Dictionary. </em></p><p><em>"These </em>regulations will be better understood from the fact, that the Orientals distinguish two sorts of baldness. The first is that which begins from the forehead, and the other that which begins from behind. The Hebrew has a distinct name for each of these. By the Arabian poets also, the former is distinguished as the ‘noble baldness,’ because it generally proceeded from the wearing of a helmet; whilst the latter was stigmatized as ‘servile baldness.’ With this understanding, let us read the terms ‘bald’ <span class="lang he-il">קרח</span>, (<em>kareach</em>) in verse 40, and ‘forehead-bald’ <span class="lang he-il">גבח</span><span class="cite-note">(</span><em>gibeach</em>) in verse 41.
