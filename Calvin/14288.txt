<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>When the wicked, etc. </em>There is no reason for translating this sentence, as some interpreters do, into the future tense. <span class="cite-ref">(579)</span> But while we retain the past tense which the prophet employs, the words may be explained in a twofold manner. The meaning but in the prophetic writings it is often used for the future. There does not, however, as Calvin remarks, appear to be any necessity for translating the verbs into the future tense in this passage, in which David may be considered as contemplating the past evidences of the goodness of God towards him, and from them taking encouragement with respect to the future. either is, that David celebrates the victory which he had obtained by the blessing of God; or there is a reference to the manner in which he had encouraged himself to hope the best, even in the midst of his temptations, namely, by thinking of God’s former favors. The latter is the exposition which I prefer. They both, however, amount to the same thing, and imply that David had no reason henceforth to doubt of God’s assistance when he considered his former experience; for nothing is of greater use to confirm our faith, than the remembrance of those instances in which God has clearly given us a proof not only of his grace, but of his truth and power. I connect this verse, accordingly, with the following one. In the former, David recalls to mind the triumphs which, by God’s help, he had already obtained; and from this he concludes, that by what hosts soever he may be environed, or whatever mischief his enemies may devise against him, he would fearlessly stand up against them. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">קרב</span><em>karab, </em>signifies <em>to approach; </em>but here it refers to the irruption that David’s enemies made upon him when they assaulted him. Some translate it <em>to fight, </em>but this translation is flat. To testify his innocence, he calls them <em>wicked or froward, </em>and by saying that they <em>came upon him to eat up his flesh, </em><span class="cite-ref">(580)</span> he expresses their savage cruelty. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(579)</span> The rendering of the learned <em>Castellio </em>is, “Si invadant — offensuri sunt atque casuri;” — “If they invade me they shall stumble and fall The Hebrew verbs for “stumble” and “fall” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(580)</span><em>French </em>and <em>Skinner </em>read, “to devour my flesh;” and observe, that “this image is taken from a wild beast.
