<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>And ye are puffed up </em>“<em>Are </em>ye not ashamed,” says he, “to glory in what affords so much occasion for humiliation?” He had observed previously, that even the highest excellence gives no just ground of glorying, inasmuch as mankind have nothing of their own, and it is only through the grace of God that they possess any excellence. (<span class="bvs">1Co_4:7</span>.) Now, however, he attacks them from another quarter. “You are,” says he, “covered with disgrace: what ground have you, then, for pride or haughtiness? For there is an amazing blindness in glorying in the midst of disgrace, in spite, as it were of angels and men.” </p><p>When he says, <em>and have not rather mourned</em>, he argues by way of contrast; for where there is grief there is no more glorying. It may be asked: “Why ought they to have <em>mourned </em>over another man’s sin?” I answer, for two reasons:<em>first</em>, in consequence of the communion that exists among the members of the Church, it was becoming that all should feel hurt at so deadly a fall on the part of one of their number; and <em>secondly</em>, when such an enormity is perpetrated in a particular Church, the perpetrator of it is all offender in such a way, that the whole society is in a manner polluted. For as God humbles the father of a family in the disgrace of his wife, or of his children, and a whole kindred in the disgrace of one of their number, so every Church ought to consider, that it contracts a stain of disgrace whenever any base crime is perpetrated in it. Nay, farther, we see how the anger of God was kindled against the whole nation of Israel on account of the sacrilege of one individual — Achan. (<span class="bvs">Jos_7:1</span>.) It was not as though God had been so cruel as to take vengeance on the innocent for another man’s crime; but, as in every instance in which anything of this nature has occurred among a people, there is already some token of his anger, so by correcting a community for the fault of one individual, he distinctly intimates that the whole body is infected and polluted with the contagion of the offense. Hence we readily infer, that it is the duty of every Church to <em>mourn </em>over the faults of individual members, as domestic calamities belonging to the entire body. And assuredly a pious and dutiful correction takes its rise in our being inflamed with holy zeal through displeasure at the offense; for otherwise severity will be felt to be bitter. <span class="cite-ref">(271)</span></p><p><em>That he might be taken away from among you. </em>He now brings out more distinctly what he finds fault with in the Corinthians — remissness, inasmuch as they connived at such an abomination. Hence, too, it appears that Churches are furnished with this power <span class="cite-ref">(272)</span> — that, whatever fault there is within them, they can correct or remove it by strictness of discipline, and that those are inexcusable that are not on the alert to have filth cleared away. For Paul here condemns the Corinthians. Why? Because they had been remiss in the punishment of one individual. Now he would have accused them unjustly, if they had not had this power. Hence the power of excommunication is established from this passage. On the other hand, as Churches have this mode of punishment put into their hands, those commit sin, <span class="cite-ref">(273)</span> as Paul shows here, that do not make use of it, when it is required; for otherwise he would act unfairly to the Corinthians in charging them with this fault. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(271)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et ne profitera pas</span>;” — “And will do no good.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(272)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et authorite</span>;” — “And authority.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(273)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Offensent Dieu</span>;” — “Offend God.” </p></div></div>
