<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face </em>Moses will hereafter be dignified by this distinction, where God would declare the difference between him and other Prophets. (<span class="bvs">Num_12:8</span>.) Familiar intercourse is therefore described in this phrase, as if it were said that God appeared to Moses by an extraordinary mode of revelation. If any object that there is a contradiction between this statement and what we shall presently see, “Thou canst not see my face,” the solution is easy, viz., that although God revealed Himself to Moses in a peculiar manner, still He never appeared in the fullness of His glory, but only so far as man’s infirmity could endure. For this expression contains an implied comparison, <em>i.e., </em>that no man was ever equal to Moses, or arrived at such a pitch of dignity. And this tends to magnify the Law, that Moses its minister reported what he had familiafly learnt, so that no ambiguity might be suspected. When it is said that Joshua departed not from the tabernacle, we gather that the dwelling-place of Moses was in the camp; and perhaps the fact of his being a young man is mentioned, <span class="cite-ref">(365)</span> in order more highly to illustrate God’s grace, in choosing that he should have the charge of the sanctuary. It is true that Joshua at this time was of mature age; but God’s special blessing was manifested in him, in that God passed over many old men, and set him who was younger to be the keeper of His tabernacle. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(365)</span> “So called (says Ainsworth) in respect of his service, not of years, for he was now above fifty years old, as may be gathered by <span class="bvs">Jos_24:29</span>. But because ministry and service are usually by the younger sort, all servants are called young men. See <span class="bvs">Gen_14:24</span>.” “Perhaps, (adds Adam Clarke,) <span class="lang he-il">נער</span><em>naghar, </em>here translated <em>young man, </em>means a <em>single person, </em>one <em>unmarried.” </em>Others suppose that he was so called as being <em>integer, </em>upright, and without guile; and De Lyra, as being young in respect to Moses. </p></div></div>
