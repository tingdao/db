<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_15:36</span><strong>.</strong><em>Saying, Let him alone, let us see if Elijah will come to save him. Mark </em>relates these words as having been spoken by the soldier, while holding out the vinegar; but Matthew tells us that others used the same language. There is no inconsistency here, however; for it is probable that the jeering was begun by one person, but was eagerly seized by others, and loudly uttered by the multitude. The phrase, <em>let him alone, </em>appears to have implied not restraint, but ridicule; accordingly, the person who first mocked Christ, ironically addressing his companions, says, <em>Let us see if Elijah will come. </em>Others quickly followed, and every one sung the same song to his next neighbor, as usually happens with men who are agreed about any course. Nor is it of any importance to inquire if it was in the singular or plural number; for in either case the meaning is the same, the word being used in place of an interjection, as if they had said, <em>Hush! Hush! </em></p></div>
