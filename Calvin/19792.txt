<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet extends the benefits of the kingdom to all the Jews, and shews how much was to be expected fromthat kingdom which he had promised; for in it would be found perfect happiness and safety. Had not this been added, what we have heard of the righteous king would have appeared cold and uninteresting; for it sometimes happens, that however much the king may exercise justice and judgment, yet the people continue still miserable. But the Prophet testifies here that the people would be in every way blessed and happy, when governed by the King promised to come. Hence he says, <em>In those days Judah shall be saved </em>He promises salvation to the Jews, though under that name are included also, as it is often the case, the ten tribes. He adds <em>Jerusalem, </em>but in a similar sense, <em>Jerusalem shall dwell safely, </em>that is, shall be in a peaceable state. This mode of speaking is taken from Moses; for the Prophets, whenever they spoke of God’s blessings, are wont to borrow their doctrine from that fountain. He then says, that the people would be saved, and then that they would be in peace and quietness. </p><p>It may now be proper to repeat what I have already touched upon, — that the salvation mentioned here belongs to the kingdom of Christ. Had he been speaking of some earthly or temporal government, the salvation must also have been temporal. But as the spiritual and celestial kingdom of Christ is the object of the promise, the salvation mentioned must reach to the very heavens. Hence its limits are far wider than the whole world. In short, the salvation of which Jeremiah now prophesies, is not to be confined to the boundaries of a fading life, nor is it to be sought in this world, where it has no standing; but if we wish to know what it is, we must learn to raise our thoughts upwards, and above the world and everything that exists here. It is an eternal salvation. In the meantime, Christ gives us some foretaste of this salvation in this life, according to what is said, </p><p>“godliness has the promises of the present as well <LineBreak />as of the future life.” (<span class="bvs">1Ti_4:8</span>) </p><p>But as this promise ought to be applied to the kingdom of Christ, there is no doubt but it is perpetual, and ought to raise up our thoughts to heaven itself. </p><p>To salvation is added <em>safety; </em>for were the faithful ever to fear and tremble, where would be their salvation? And we know that the happiness brought to us by Christ cannot be otherwise received, except through peace, according to what Scripture so often teaches us: </p><p>“Having been justified,” says Paul, “we have peace with God.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_5:1</span>.) </p><p>And then when he speaks in the fourteenth chapter of the same Epistle of the kingdom of God, he says that it consists in joy and peace; and in another place he says, </p><p>“May the peace of God, which surpasses all conception, obtain the victory in your hearts.” (<span class="bvs">Phi_4:7</span>) </p><p>Hence these things are connected together, salvation and peace, not that we enjoy this joyful and peaceful state in the world; for they greatly deceive themselves who dream of such a quiet state here, as we have to engage in a perpetual warfare, until God at length gathers us to the fruition of a blessed rest. We must, therefore, contend and fight in this world. Thus the faithful shall ever be exposed to many troubles; and hence Christ reminds his disciples, “In me ye have peace; but in theworld” — what? Sorrows and troubles. (<span class="bvs">Joh_16:33</span>) </p><p>We now, then, see why the Prophet joined safety or security to salvation, even because we cannot otherwise know that we shall be saved, except we be fully persuaded that God so cares for our salvation as to protect us by his power, and that his aid will be always ready whenever needed. </p><p>He in the last place adds, <em>And this is the name by which they shall call her, Jehovah our righteousness </em>In chapter 23 (<span class="bvs">Jer_23:0</span>) this name is given to Christ, and to him alone it properly belongs; but it is here transferred to the Church, for whatever belongs to the head, is made common to all the members. For we indeed know that Christ has nothing as his own, for as he is made righteousness, it belongs to us, according to what Paul says, </p><p>“He is made to us righteousness, and redemption, and sanctification, and wisdom.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_1:30</span>) </p><p>As, then, the Father conferred righteousness on his own Son for our sake, it is no wonder that what is in his power is transferred to us. What, then, we found in the twenty-third chapter was rightly declared, for it belongs peculiarly to Christ, that he is God our righteousness. But as we partake of this righteousness, when he admits us into a participation of all the blessings by which he is adorned and enriched by the Father, it hence follows, that this also belongs to the whole Church, even that God is its righteousness. <span class="cite-ref">(91)</span> Hence it is wisely said by the Prophet, that this would be the name of the whole Church, which could not be, except it had put on Christ, so that God might reign there in righteousness, for the righteousness of Christ extends to all the faithful; and Christ also dwells in them, so that they are not only the temples of Christ, but, as it were, a part of him; and even the Church itself is by Paul called Christ, </p><p>“As there are,” he says, “many members in the human body, <LineBreak />so is Christ.” (<span class="bvs">1Co_12:12</span>) </p><p>This cannot be applied to Christ personally, but he thus calls the Church by a metonymy, on account of that participation which I have mentioned. </p><p><strong>(91)</strong> See Preface to the third volume. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
