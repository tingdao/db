<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And thou shalt make an altar. </em>The altar of whole burnt-offerings (<em>holocaustorum</em>) is here described, which, however, it was called by <em>synecdoche, </em>for not only entire victims were burnt there, but also parts of them only, as we shall see in Leviticus. The burnt-offerings received their name from their <em>ascending, </em><span class="cite-ref">(147)</span> whereby the Israelites were reminded that they had need to be purified, that they might ascend to God; and at the same time were instructed that whatever corruption there might be in the flesh did not prevent the sacrifices from being acceptable and of a sweet savor to God. It is clear that from the first beginning of the human race there were burnt-sacrifices, suggested by the secret inspiration of God’s Spirit, since there was no written Law; nor can we doubt but that by this symbol they were taught that the flesh must be burnt by the Spirit, in order that men may duly offer themselves to God; and thus they acknowledged, under this type, that the flesh of Christ must receive this from the divine power, so as to become a perfect victim for the propitiation of God; thus, as the Apostle testifies, he offered himself through the Spirit. (<span class="bvs">Heb_9:14</span>.) But fuller mention of this subject will be made elsewhere. The altar was so constructed that the sacrifices might be cast upon a grate placed within it, and thus they were covered by its external surface. The ashes were received into a pan, so that they should not fall about upon the ground and be trodden under foot, but that reverence might be inculcated even towards the very remnants of their holy things. <span class="cite-ref">(148)</span> That the victims were bound to the four horns, which stood out from the four corners, is plain from the words of <span class="bvs">Psa_118:27</span>, “Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.” And this also is the beginning of a proper offering of spiritual sacrifices, that all the lusts of the flesh should be subdued, and held captive as it were unto the obedience of God. Wherefore even Christ, although in Him there was nothing which was not duly regulated, was nevertheless bound, in order to prove His obedience; as He had said, “Not as I will, but as thou wilt.” (<span class="bvs">Mat_26:39</span>.) The altar was carried on staves, to obviate the necessity of having more than one; else there would have been danger of their being compelled, by the very difficulty of carrying it, to leave it behind after it was made, if they were setting about a long journey; and this would have been the seed or ground of superstition, whilst no other could be built which was not spurious. </p><p><strong>(147)</strong><em>C</em>. alludes to their Hebrew name, <span class="lang he-il">עלה</span>, the primary signification of which is mounting upwards. — <em>W </em></p><p><strong>(148)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais que la sainctete des </span><em class="lang fr-fr">sacremens </em><em>,” </em>etc. — <em>Fr</em>. be an hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits <em>of </em>fine twined linen, and their sockets <em>of </em>brass. </p></div>
