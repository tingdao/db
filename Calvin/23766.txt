<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_19:3</span><strong>.</strong><em>And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him. </em>Though the Pharisees lay snares for Christ, and cunningly endeavor to impose upon him, yet their malice proves to be highly useful to us; as the Lord knows how to turn, in a wonderful manner, to the advantage of his people all the contrivances of wicked men to overthrow sound doctrine. For, by means of this occurrence, a question arising out of the liberty of divorce was settled, and a fixed law was laid down as to the sacred and indissoluble bond of marriage. The occasion of this quibbling was, that the reply, in whatever way it were given, could not, as they thought, fail to be offensive. </p><p>They ask, <em>Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever? </em>If Christ reply in the negative, they will exclaim that he wickedly abolishes the Law; and if in the affirmative, they will give out that he is not a prophet of God, but rather a pander, who lends such countenance to the lust of men. Such were the calculations which they had made in their own minds; but the Son of God, who knew how to <em>take the wise in their own craftiness</em>, (<span class="bvs">Job_5:13</span>,) disappointed them, sternly opposing unlawful divorces, and at the same time showing that he brings forward nothing which is inconsistent with the Law. For he includes the whole question under two heads: that the order of creation ought to serve for a law, that the husband should maintain conjugal fidelity during the whole of life; and that <em>divorces </em>were <em>permitted</em>, not because they were lawful, but because Moses had to deal with a rebellious and intractable nation. </p></div>
