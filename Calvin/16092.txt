<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Our feet shall be standing within thy gates, O Jerusalem! </em>In the Hebrew text the verb is indeed in the past tense, which it would not be unsuitable to retain; but as it makes little <em>difference </em>as to the meaning whether the one reading or the other is adopted, I have no difficulty in leaving my readers to their own <em>choice. </em>David rehearses the language in which all the godly in common expressed themselves — that they should at length stand with sure footing in Jerusalem, because it was the will of God there to establish his Sanctuary, which hitherto had often changed its lodgings, and had been carried from place to place. By such a pilgrimage state of the ark, God reminded the people that he had not without cause spoken by Moses what I have a little ago adverted to. Thus, whenever the ark of the covenant was conveyed from one place to another, God thereby stirred up the hearts of his servants to desire and pray that a certain settled place might be appointed to it. Moreover, this fixing of its seat was not a matter of small moment. As while it was frequently changing its abode, the faith of the people hung in suspense, so after God had chosen for it a permanent residence, he by this testified more unequivocally that he would be the ever, lasting and unchangeable protector of his people. It is, therefore, not surprising to find the faithful gratefully acknowledging that their feet, which had hitherto been wont to run from place to place, should henceforth stand steadfast within the gates of Jerusalem. The ark, it is true, dwelt a long time in Shiloh, (<span class="bvs">1Sa_1:3</span>,) but God having made no promise concerning that place, it could not be the permanent abode of that symbol of the divine presence. On the contrary, since, as we shall see on <span class="bvs">Psa_132:14</span>, it was said of mount Zion — “This is my rest for ever,” the faithful, depending upon that promise, confidently boast that their feet shall hereafter be at rest and stand firm. Farther, as Christ, </p><p>“in whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,” (<span class="bvs">Col_2:9</span>,) </p><p>and who is our true Immanuel, (<span class="bvs">Isa_7:14</span>,) now resides amongst us, he has furnished us with matter of more abundant joy. We are, therefore, ungrateful and stupid, if that promise — </p><p>“Lo, I am wit you always, even unto the end of the world,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_28:20</span>,) </p><p>does not ravish us with exceeding joy, and especially if we see it in any place received publicly and with common consent. What I have just now quoted concerning the rest or repose of the Lord, has been at length accomplished in the person of Christ, as is evident from <span class="bvs">Isa_11:10</span> — “His rest shall be glorious;” where the Prophet does not speak of the burial of Christ, as some interpreters erroneously suppose, but of the future distinction of the Church. </p></div>
