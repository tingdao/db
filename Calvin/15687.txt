Had they exclusively inhabited the land of Canaan, they would have more easily retained the pure worship of God. Allured by the influence of such neighbors, it is not wonderful that they soon degenerated from the footsteps of their fathers, for we are more inclined to follow the example of the bad than of the good. And now he speaks of the descendants of those who had so frequently provoked God’s anger in the wilderness, and declares, that as the same unbelief, rebellion, and ingratitude, were rampant in the succeeding race, they were no better than their fathers. </p><p>In mingling with the heathens they openly rejected the distinguishing loving-kindness of God, who adopted them as his children, under the express condition that they should be separated from these profane nations. Therefore, in associating with them indiscriminately, they render this holy covenant of no effect. When he adds, <em>that they learned their works, </em>he warns us, that nothing is more dangerous than associating with the ungodly; because, being more prone to follow vice than virtue, it cannot but be, that the more conversant we are with corruption, the more widely will it spread. In such circumstances, the utmost care and caution are requisite, lest the wicked, with whom we come into contact, infect us by their vitiated morals; and particularly where there is danger of relapsing into idolatry, to which we are all naturally prone. What, then, will be the effect produced upon us when instigated by others to commit sin, but to add sin to sin? <span class="cite-ref">(267)</span> The prophet, therefore, declares that the Jews were already so much under the tuition of the heathen as to abandon themselves to the practice of their idolatrous rites. In employing the word <em>to serve, </em>he confutes the contemptible evasion of the Papists, who pretend that they do not give to images the worship that is due to God alone, but only a sort of honorary adoration. <span class="cite-ref">(268)</span> But if the worshipping of images be lawful, the prophet had no sufficient cause to condemn his own nation for serving strange gods. Despicable, therefore, is the distinction, that Divine homage is to be paid to God alone, and that a kind of honorary adoration is to be given to images. He adds, that this <em>issued in their overthrow, </em>in order that their obstinate attachment to their follies, and their despising the chastisements of God, may more palpably appear. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(267)</span> “Quid igitur fief ubi oleum camino adder aliena instigatio ?” — <em>Lat. </em>“<span class="lang fr-fr">Que sera-ce donc quand l’instigation d’autruy iettera (comme l’on dit) de l’huile dedans le feu</span> ?” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(268)</span> “Dum adoratione duliae, non latriae, se imagines colere excusant.” — <em>Lat</em>. — See volume 2, page 272, note. </p></div></div>
