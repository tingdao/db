<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And Abraham called the name</em>. Moses does not mean that Abraham was the inventor of the name; but that he adhered to the name which before had been given by the angel. This act of obedience, however, was worthy of commendation, since he not only ratified the word of God, but also executed his office as Godâ€™s minister. For, as a herald, he proclaimed to all, that which the angel had committed to his trust. </p></div>
