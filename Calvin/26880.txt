<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Woman, why weepest thou? </em>From the statements of the Evangelists, it may be readily concluded, that the angel held a long conversation; but John gives a brief summary of what was spoken, because this was sufficient for proving the resurrection of Christ. The conversation consists of reproof mingled with comfort. The angel reproves Mary for her excessive <em>weeping, </em>but, at the same time, mingles joy, when he says that there is no reason to weep, since Christ has risen. </p></div>
