<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21</strong><em>Wherefore lay apart</em>. He concludes by saying how the word of life is to be received. And first, indeed, he intimates that it cannot be rightly received except it be implanted, or strike roots in us. For the expression, <em>to receive the implanted word</em>, ought to be thus explained, “to receive it, that it may be really implanted.” For he alludes to seed often sown on and ground, and not received into the moist bosom of the earth; or to plants, which being cast on the ground, or laid on dead wood, soon wither. He then requires that it should be a living implanting, by which the word becomes as it were united with our heart. </p><p>He at the same time shews the way and manner of this reception, even <em>with meekness</em>. By this word he means humility and the readiness of a mind disposed to learn, such as Isaiah describes when he says, </p><p>“On whom does my Spirit rest, except on the humble and meek?” (<span class="bvs">Isa_57:15</span>.) </p><p>Hence it is, that so far profit in the school of God, because hardly one in a hundred renounces the stubbornness of his own spirit, and gently submits to God; but almost all are conceited and refractory. But if we desire to be the living plantation of God, we must subdue our proud hearts and be humble, and labor to become like lambs, so as to suffer ourselves to be ruled and guided by our Shepherd. </p><p>But as men are never thus tamed, so as to have a calm and meek heart, except they are purged from depraved affections, so he bids us to <em>lay aside uncleanness and redundancy of wickedness</em>. And as James borrowed a comparison from agriculture, it was necessary for him to observe this order, to begin by rooting up noxious weeds. And since he addressed all, we may hence conclude that these are the innate evils of our nature, and that they cleave to us all; yea, since he addresses the faithful, he shews that we are never wholly cleansed from them in this life, but that they are continually sprouting up, and therefore he requires that care should be constantly taken to eradicate them. As the word of God is especially a holy thing; to be fitted to receive it, we must put off the filthy things by which we have been polluted. </p><p>Under the word <span class="lang el-gr">κακία</span>, he comprehends hypocrisy and obstinacy as well as unlawful desires or lusts. Not satisfied with specifying the seat of wickedness as being in the soul of man, he teaches us that so abounding is the wickedness that dwells there, that it overflows, or that it rises up as it were into a heap; and doubtless, whosoever will well examine himself will find that there is within him an immense chaos of evils. <span class="cite-ref">(109)</span></p><p><em>Which is able to save</em>. It is a high eulogy on heavenly truth, that we obtain through it a sure salvation; and this is added, that we may learn to seek and love and magnify the word as a treasure that is incomparable. It is then a sharp goad to chastise our idleness, when he says that the word which we are wont to hear so negligently, is the means of our salvation, though for this purpose the power of saving is not ascribed to the word, as if salvation is conveyed by the external sound of the word, or as if the office of saving is taken away from God and transferred elsewhere; for James speaks of the word which by faith penetrates into the hearts of men, and only intimates that God, the author of salvation, conveys it by his Gospel. </p><p><strong>(109)</strong> What renders this passage unsatisfactory is the meaning given to <span class="lang el-gr">περισσεία</span>, rendered by some “superfluity,” and by others “redundancy.” The verb <span class="lang el-gr">περισσεύω</span> means not only to abound, but also to be a residue, to remain, to be a remnant. See <span class="bvs">Mat_14:20</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_9:17</span>. And its derivative <span class="lang el-gr">περίσσευμα</span> is used in the sense of a remnant or a remainder, <span class="bvs">Mar_8:8</span>; and this very word is used in the <em>Sept.</em>, for <span class="lang he-il">יתר</span> which means <em>a residue, a remnant, </em>or <em>what remains, </em><span class="bvs">Eze_6:8</span>. Let it have this meaning here, and the sense will not only be clear, but very striking. James was addressing those who were Christians; and he exhorted them to throw away every uncleanness and remnant of wickedness, or evil, as the word <span class="lang el-gr">κακία</span> more properly means. See <span class="bvs">Act_8:22</span>; <span class="bvs">1Pe_2:16</span></p><p>“Every uncleanness,” or filthiness, means every kind of uncleanness arising from lustful and carnal indulgences; and the “remnant of wickedness,” in thought and in deed, most suitably follows. </p></div>
