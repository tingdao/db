<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet again teaches us, that whatever he prophesied respecting the destruction of the city Nineveh, was for this end, — that God, by this remarkable evidence, might show that he had a care for his people, and that he was not unmindful of the covenant he had made with the children of Abraham. This prophecy would have otherwise produced no salutary effect on the Israelites; they might have thought that it was by chance, or by some fatal revolution, or through some other cause, that Nineveh had been overthrown. Hence the Prophet shows, that the ruin of the city, and of the monarchy of Nineveh, would be a proof of the paternal love of God towards his chosen people, and that such a change was to be made for the sake of one people, because God, though he had for a time punished the Israelites, yet purposed that some seed should remain, for it would have been inconsistent, that the covenant, which was to be inviolate, should be entirely abolished. We now then understand the Prophet’s object, and how this verse is to be connected with the rest of the context. </p><p><em>Behold, </em>he says, <em>on the mountains the feet of him who announces peace </em><span class="cite-ref">(222)</span> Some think that the Prophet alludes to the situation of Jerusalem. We indeed know that mountains were around it: but the Prophet speaks more generally, — that heralds of peace shall ascend to the tops of mountains, that their voice might be more extensively heard: <em>Behold, </em>he says<em>, on the mountains the feet of him who announces peace; </em>for all the roads had been before closed up, and hardly any one dared to whisper. If any one inquired either respecting peace or war, there was immediate danger lest he should fall under suspicion. As then the Assyrians, by their tyrannical rule, had deprived the Israelites of the freedom of speech, the Prophet says now, that the feet of those who should announce peace would be on the mountains; that is, that there would be now free liberty to proclaim peace on the highest places. By <em>feet, </em>he means, as we have explained, coming; and Isaiah speaks a similar language, </p><p>‘How beautiful are the feet of those who announce peace, <LineBreak />who announce good things!’ (<span class="bvs">Isa_52:7</span>.) </p><p>Arise, then, he says, shall heralds of peace everywhere: and the repetition in other words seems to express this still more clearly; for he says, <em>of him who announces and causes to hear </em>He might have simply said <span class="lang he-il">מבשר</span>, <em>mebesher</em>, but he adds <span class="lang he-il">משמיע</span>, <em>meshemio</em>; not only, he says, he will announce peace, but also with a clear and loud voice, so that his preaching may be heard from the remotest places. We now perceive what the Prophet had in view, and what his words import. </p><p>Now he adds, <em>Celebrate, Judah, thy festal days</em>. It is indeed a repetition of the same word, as if we were to say in Latin<em>, Festiva festivitates, </em>feast festivities; but this has nothing to do with the meaning of the passage. I am disposed to subscribe to the opinion of those who think, that there is here an intimation of the interruption of festal days; for so disordered were all things at Jerusalem and in the country around, that sacrifices had ceased, and festal days were also intermitted; for sacred history tells us, that the Passover was celebrated anew under Hezekiah, and also under Josiah. This omission no doubt happened, owing to the wars by which the country had been laid waste. Hence the Prophet now intimates, that there would be quietness and peace for the chosen people, so that they might all without any fear ascend to Jerusalem, and celebrate their festal days, and give thanks to the Lord, and rejoice before him, according to the language often used by Moses. At the same time, the Prophet no doubt reminds the Jews for what end the Lord would break off the enemy’s yoke, and exempt them from servile fear, and that was, that they might sacrifice to God and worship him, while enjoying their quiet condition. And that he addresses Judah is not done without reason; for though the kingdom of Israel was not as yet so rejected, that God did not regard them as his people, yet there were no legitimate sacrifices among them, and no festal days which God approved: we indeed know that the worship which prevailed there was corrupt and degenerated. Inasmuch then as God repudiated the sacrifices which were offered in Israel, Nahum addresses here his discourse to Judah only; but yet he intimates, that God had been thus bountiful to the Israelites, that they, remembering their deliverance, might give him thanks. </p><p>Let us then know, that when the Lord grants us tranquillity and preserves us in a quiet state, this end ought ever to be kept in view, — that it is his will, that we should truly serve him. But if we abuse the public peace given us, and if pleasures occasion a forgetfulness of God, this ingratitude will by no means be endured. We ought, indeed, in extreme necessities to sacrifice to God, as we have need then especially of fleeing to his mercy; but as we cannot so composedly worship him in a disturbed state of mind, he is pleased to allow us peaceable times. Now, if we misapply this leisure, and indulge in sloth, yea, if we become so heedless as to neglect God, this as I have said will be an intolerable evil. Let us then take notice of the Prophet’s words in setting forth the design of God, — that he would free his people from the power of the Assyrians, that they might celebrate their festal days. </p><p>He adds, <em>Pay thy vows </em>He not only speaks here of the ordinary sacrifices and of the worship which had been prescribed; but he also requires a special proof of gratitude for having been then delivered by the hand of God; for we know what paying of vows meant among the Hebrews: they were wont to offer peace-offerings, when they returned victorious from war, or when they were delivered from any danger, or when they were relieved from some calamity. The Prophet therefore now shows, that it was right to pay vows to God, inasmuch as he had dealt so bountifully with his people; as it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_116:0</span>, ‘What shall I return to the Lord for all his benefits which he has bestowed on me? The cup of salvation will I take, and on the name of the Lord will I call.’ We also find it thus written in Hosea, </p><p>‘The calves of thy lips to me shalt thou render,’ <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Hos_14:2</span>.) </p><p>We now perceive what Nahum substantially meant, — that when peace was restored, the people were not to bury so great and so remarkable a kindness of God, but to pay their vows; that is, that the people were to testify that God was the author of their deliverance, and that the redemption which they had obtained was the peculiar work of God. </p><p>It follows, “Add no more to pass through thee shall Belial, for utterly is he cut off.” This passage must not be explained in a general sense; for we know that the Chaldeans became more grievous to the Jews than the Assyrians had been; but the Prophet here refers especially to the Ninevites, that is, to the Assyrians, whose metropolis, as it has been said, was Nineveh. <em>That wicked one then shall not add any more to pass through thee. </em>—<em>Why? for he is entirely cut off. </em>This reason given by the Prophet clearly proves, that he speaks not of the wicked generally, but that he especially points out the Assyrians. Now follows — </p><p><strong>(222)</strong><em>Calvin </em>gives to <span class="lang he-il">מבשר</span> only the sense of announcing or declaring. To spread or to bring news or tidings is its meaning; for it is used to designate bad as well as good tidings. See <span class="bvs">1Sa_4:17</span>; <span class="bvs">2Sa_1:20</span>; and <span class="bvs">2Sa_4:10</span>; <span class="bvs">Isa_3:7</span>. It is commonly rendered <span class="lang el-gr">ευαγγελιζεσθαι</span> by the Septuagint. It may be regarded here as a participle in the same predicament with the participle which follows. The same mode of construction we find in <span class="bvs">Isa_52:7</span>; where it evidently appears that the word means strictly to bring or to declare tidings, for <em>good </em>is added to it. That passage is as follows: — </p><p>How beautiful on the mountains <LineBreak />Are the feet of him who announceth, <LineBreak />Who proclaimeth peace, — <LineBreak />Of him who announceth good, ( בוט רשבמ) <LineBreak />Who proclaimeth salvation! <LineBreak />Saying to Zion, Reign doth thy God. </p><p>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
