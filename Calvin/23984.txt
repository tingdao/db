<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Lo, he is in the desert. </em>Luke connects this discourse with another reply of Christ; for, having been interrogated by the Pharisees <em>about the coming of the kingdom of God, </em>he replied, that<em>it would not come with observation; </em>and then follows in Luke’s narrative that, turning <em>to his disciples, </em>he informed them that <em>the days would come when they would no longer see a day of the Son of man. </em>By these words he intended to charge them </p><p>to walls in the light before the darkness of the night overtook them, (<span class="bvs">Joh_12:35</span>;) </p><p>for this ought to have been a very powerful excitement to endeavor to make progress, so long as they enjoyed the presence of Christ, when they 1earned that very serious disturbances were at hand. Whether or not Christ admonished his disciples twice on this subject is uncertain; but I think it. probable that Luke, while he was speaking of <em>the coming of the kingdom of God </em>introduced sentences taken from a different occasion, which he frequently does, as we have seen in other instances. </p><p>But as this passage has been, through ignorance, tortured in various ways, that the reader may ascertain the true meaning, he must attend to the contrast between a state of concealment and that extension of the kingdom of Christ far and wide, and which would be sudden and unexpected, <em>as the lightning dashes from the east to the west. </em>For we know that the <em>false Christs </em>—in accordance with the gross and foolish hope of that nation—drew along with them as large bodies of men as they could collect into the recesses of the desert, or into caverns, or other places of retirement, in order to throw off the yoke of the Roman government by force and by arms. The meaning therefore is, that every one who collects his forces into a secret place, in order to regain the freedom of the nation by arms, falsely pretends to be <em>the Christ; </em>for the Redeemer is sent to diffuse his grace suddenly and unexpectedly through every quarter of the world. But these two things are quite contrary, to shut up redemption within some corner, and to spread it through the whole world. The disciples were thus reminded that they must no longer seek a Redeemer within the small enclosure of Judea, because he will suddenly extend the limits of his kingdom to the uttermost ends of the world. And, indeed, this astonishing rapidity, with which the gospel flew through every part of the world, was a manifest testimony of divine power. For it could not be the result of human industry, that the light of the gospel, as soon as it appear, darted from one side of the world to the opposite side <em>like lightning; </em>and therefore it is not without reason that Christ introduces this circumstance for demonstrating and magnifying his heavenly glory. Besides, by holding out this vast extent of his kingdom, he intended to show that the desolation of Judea would not hinder him from reigning. </p></div>
