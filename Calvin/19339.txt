<div class="comment-content"><p>This is a new discourse, which yet is not unlike many others, except in this particular, that the Prophet was <em>not to marry a wife nor beget children in the land </em>But as to the general subject, he repeats now what he had often said before and confirmed in many places. But the prohibition to marry was full of meaning; it was to shew that the people were wholly given up to destruction. The law of man’s creation, we know, was this, </p><p>“Increase and multiply.” (<span class="bvs">Gen_1:22</span>; <span class="bvs">Gen_8:17</span>; <span class="bvs">Gen_9:1</span>) </p><p>As then mankind are perpetuated by marriage, here on the contrary God shews that that land was unworthy of this common and even general blessing enjoyed by the whole race of man. It is the same as if he had said, “They indeed as yet live, but a quick destruction awaits them, for I will deprive them of the universal favor which I have hitherto shewed to all mankind.” </p><p>Marriage is the preservation of the human race: <em>Take not to thee a wife and beget no children </em>We hence see that in the person of Jeremiah God intended to shew the Jews that they deserved to be exterminated from the earth. This is the import of this prophecy. </p><p>It may however be asked, whether the Prophet was unmarried? But this has nothing to do with the subject, for he received this command in a vision; and though he might not have been unmarried, he might still have proclaimed this prophecy, that God had forbidden him to marry and to beget children. At the same time, I think it were probable that the Prophet. was not married, for as he walked naked, and as he carried on his neck a yoke, so also his celibacy might have been intended to be, as it were, a living representation, in order to produce an effect on the Jews. But, as I have already said, we need not contend about this matter. Every one then is at liberty to judge as he pleases, only I suggest what I deem most probable. </p></div>
