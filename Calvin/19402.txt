<div class="comment-content"><p>Though no word of comparison is expressed, if we read <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, <em>beth</em>, and not <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>, <em>caph</em>, yet the Prophet employs a comparison, for God did not drive away the Jews by an eastern wind, but as the force of that wind is violent in Judea, the eastern wind often means a storm or a whirlwind, as though he had said, “As by a whirlwind or a storm will I cast them out.” <span class="cite-ref">(203)</span><em>I will disperse </em>or dissipate <em>them</em>, he says, <em>before the face of the enemy. </em>He means that enemies would come to exterminate the Jews from the land; and he adds another thing, that these enemies would be full of terror, for God would give them the force of a whirlwind or a storm to disperse and scatter the Jews, for being terrified by God they would not dare to withstand. </p><p>Then follows a commination, that God would <em>turn to them the neck</em>, or the back, <em>and not the face in the day of calamity</em>. It sometimes happens that we are severely chastised by God, he thus often tries his faithful people when he subjects them to the will of the ungodly; but yet all remedy is not taken away from them, as they find consolation in God’s mercy, for as he casts down so he raises up, as he puts to death so he gives life, according to what is said in <span class="bvs">1Sa_2:6</span>. But God here denounces a punishment without any prospect of pardon or alleviation, <em>I will scatter them</em>, he says, as by an east wind before their enemies. Then he adds, “In vain shall they flee to me and seek my mercy, though otherwise it is offered to all, yet then they shall implore it in vain, for it is decreed not to pardon them. I will shew to them my back, (or neck, for <span class="lang he-il">ערף</span>, <em>oreph</em>, is the hinder part of the head, but here it means the back,) they shall then find that I am turned away from them, so that they shall not be set before my eyes.” For it is an invaluable consolation when God is pleased to look on our miseries, but he deprives the Jews of this hope, for he would turn to them his back in the <em>day of slaughter</em>. I cannot proceed farther now. </p><p><strong>(203)</strong> Many copies read <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, though all the versions retain the <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>; “As a burning wind will I scatter them,” is the version of the <em>Septuagint </em>and the <em>Vulgate</em>; “As a hot wind,” etc, is the <em>Syriac</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
