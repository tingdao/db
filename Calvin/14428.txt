<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>O Lord! how long wilt thou look on? </em>The meaning of the word which I have translated <em>how long, </em>is ambiguous in the Hebrew. In Latin it signifies, How long wilt thou see it, and suffer it without uttering a word? But the other interpretation is equally appropriate, namely, After having seemed to take no notice of the matter for a long time, when wilt thou at length begin to see it? The meaning, however, is substantially the same, for David complains of Godâ€™s long forbearance, declaring that while the wicked are running to every excess, God connives at them, and delays too much to take vengeance. And although God inculcates upon the faithful the duty of quietly and patiently waiting till the time arrive when he shall judge it proper to help them, yet he allows them to bewail in prayer the grief which they experience on account of his delay. At the same time, David shows, that in so speaking he is not carried headlong merely by the importunity of his desire, but that he is constrained to it by the extremity of his distress. For he says that they tumultuously rush upon him to take away his life, and he compares them to <em>lions, </em>and calls <em>his soul solitary, </em>or <em>alone. </em>Some think that the expression, <em>only soul, </em>means <em>clear and precious, </em>or <em>well beloved; </em>but such do not sufficiently consider the design of David, as has been stated in the 22<span class="cite-ref">nd</span> Psalm at the twenty-first verse. </p></div>
