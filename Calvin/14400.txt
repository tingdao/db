<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Come, children, </em><span class="cite-ref">(696)</span><em>hearken unto me. </em>The Psalmist continues, with increased earnestness, to exhort the faithful, that they may know that nothing can be more profitable for them than to conduct themselves justly and harmlessly towards all men. As the greater part of men imagine that the best and the shortest way to attain a life of happiness and ease consists in striving to surpass other men in violence, fraud, injustice, and other means of mischief, it is necessary frequently to repeat this doctrine. Moreover, as it is necessary that the minds of men should be brought to a chastened and humble state, by calling them <em>his children, </em>he endeavors, by this gentle and courteous appellation, to allay all froward affections. None will stand unmoved amidst so many assaults, but those who have been endued by the Spirit of meekness with the greatest modesty. The prophet, therefore, tells them at the outset, that the rule of life which he prescribes can be observed and obeyed by those only who are meek and submissive. To the same purpose is the word <em>come, </em>and the command <em>to hearken; </em>and they imply, that men laying aside all wilfulness of spirit, and having subdued the ardor and impetuosity of their minds, should become docile and meek. He has put <em>the fear of the Lord </em>for the rule of a pious and holy life: as if he had said, Whilst virtue and righteousness are in every manâ€™s mouth, there are few who lead a holy life, and live as they ought; because they know not what it is to serve God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(696)</span> By this affectionate appellation, Hebrew teachers were wont to address their scholars. </p></div></div>
