<div class="comment-content"><p>In the following verse, that he may cherish still greater confidence in God, David again declares, that he has to do with enemies of an irreconcilable character, and who are fully bent upon cruelty. Of this we ought to be firmly persuaded, that the more grievously we are oppressed, so much the more certainly ought we to expect deliverance. He therefore says, that they speak of nothing but of tumults and slaughter. The meaning of the latter clause is somewhat obscure, arising from the ambiguous signification of the word <span class="lang he-il">רגע</span><em>, rige. </em>As the word from which it is derived sometimes signifies <em>to cut, </em>and sometimes <em>to rest, </em>or <em>to be quiet and peaceable, </em>there are some who translate it <em>the meek and peaceable of the earth: </em>others translate it, <em>with the tranquil and easy of the earth; </em>meaning by this, those who live in the midst of riches and abundance, in the enjoyment of undisturbed repose. Both these seem to me to be forced interpretations. Others, too, though not more correctly, expound the word <em>in caves </em>or <em>secret places, </em>in order that, as they say, the wicked and deceitful counsels of such persons may not come to light. But it may be very appropriately rendered, <em>the clefts of the earth, </em>and by this metaphor are meant the miserable and afflicted, who are, as it were, broken and maimed. David, therefore, declares that as soon as his enemies see any opening, that is to say, some calamity befall him, they instantly put forth all their efforts to accomplish his destruction. Those who, in the time of his prosperity and power, never dared even to utter a word against him, began now, when they saw that his influence was feeble, to plot his ruin, just as we know that the wicked are for the most part persons of a servile and cowardly disposition, and assume not the tone of insolence save when an advantageous opportunity presents itself, as when the good and simple are in adversity. To the same purpose he represents them in the next verse, as crying out with open mouth, Aha! aha! and clapping their hands for joy that they saw David overcome, and, as it were, laid prostrate in the dust, a spectacle in which they took great delight. </p></div>
