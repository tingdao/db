<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>But if this thing be true</em>. If the punishment should seem to anybody to be somewhat too severe, let him reflect that no kind of fraud is more intolerable. A false sale of a field or a house shall be accounted a crime, as also the utterance of false money; and, therefore, she who abuses the sacred name of marriage for deception, and offers an unchaste body instead of a chaste one, much less deserves to be pardoned. The cause of severity, however, which is expressly mentioned, is much more extensive, <em>i e</em>. , because she hath wrought wickedness, or filthiness in Israel. The translation which some. give, <em>folly</em>, is poor; for although the word. is derived from <span class="lang he-il">נבל</span>, <em>nabal</em>, it still means something more atrocious than folly; just as Simeon and Levi, in excuse for their slaughter of the Shechemites, call the defilement of their sister <span class="cite-ref">(83)</span><span class="lang he-il">נבלה</span>, <em>nebalah</em>, that is, filthiness in Israel. ( <span class="bvs">Gen_34:7</span>.) Whence it appears once more how greatly acceptable to God is chastity. </p><p><strong>(83)</strong> “Folly, that which is contrary to sound reason, wickedness.” — Simon’s Heb. Lex. — <em>W</em>. Taylor, in his Concordance, says, “Folly, rather <em>vice</em>: , <em>villany</em>, or what can be supposed in bad morals to be answerable to sapless, withered flowers, leaves, or fruit. <span class="bvs">Gen_34:7</span>; <span class="bvs">Jos_7:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Jud_19:23</span>.” </p></div>
