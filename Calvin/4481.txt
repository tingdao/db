<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And those that died in the plague. </em>Paul, when he says that only twenty-three thousand died, appears to differ from Moses; but we know that the exact account of numbers is not always observed, and it is probable that <em>about </em>twenty-four thousand were slain. Paul, therefore, subtracted one thousand, and was content with the lesser number; <span class="cite-ref">(185)</span> from which, however, we may perceive how severe and terrible was the punishment, teaching us to beware of provoking God by fornication. For, as it is a monstrous thing that so great a multitude should have been infected by this foul and shameful sin, so God’s fearful judgment against adulterers and fornicators is set before us. We have already seen that, although they were guilty of a wicked rebellion, still the punishment is justly ascribed to their lust, which impelled them to idolatry. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(185)</span><em>C</em>. in his Commentary on <span class="bvs">1Co_10:8</span>, enlarges somewhat more on this point: “There perished in one day twenty-three thousand, or, as Moses says, twenty-four thousand. Though they differ as to number, it is easy to reconcile them, as it is no unusual thing, when it is not intended to number exactly and minutely each head, to put down a number that comes near it, as among the Romans there were those that received the name of <em>ceatumviri, </em>(the <em>hundred,) </em>while in reality there were two above the hundred. As there were, therefore, about twenty-four thousand that were overthrown by the Lord’s hand — that is, above twenty-three thousand, Moses has set down the number <em>above </em>the mark, and Paul the number <em>below </em>it, and in this way there is in reality no difference.” — Cal. Soc. Edit., vol. 1, p. 324. </p></div></div>
