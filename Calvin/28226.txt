<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And if some of the branches, etc. </em>He now refers to the present dignity of the Gentiles, which is no other than to be of the branches; which, being taken from another, are set in some noble tree: for the origin of the Gentiles was as it were from some wild and unfruitful olive, as nothing but a curse was to be found in their whole race. Whatever glory then they had was from their new insition, not from their old stock. There was then no reason for the Gentiles to glory in their own dignity in comparison with the Jews. We may also add, that Paul wisely mitigates the severity of the case, by not saying that the whole top of the tree was cut off, but that some of the branches were broken, and also that God took some here and there from among the Gentiles, whom he set in the holy and blessed trunk. <span class="cite-ref">(356)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(356)</span> There is a difference of opinion as to the precise meaning of the words<span class="lang el-gr">ἐνεκεντρίσθης ἐν αὐτοις </span> [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] <em>’s </em>version is, “insitus es pro ipsis — thou hast been ingrafted for them,” or in their stead; that of [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] is the same, and also that of [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>]; but [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] has “inter illos — between them,” that is, the remaining branches; and [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] renders the words “among them,” according to our version. What is most consonant with the first part of the verse, is the rendering of [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>]; what is stated is the cutting off of some of the branches, and the most obvious meaning is, that others were put in for them, or in their stead. It has been said, that it was not the practice to graft a wild olive in a good olive, except when the latter was decaying, such may have been the case; but the Apostle’s object was no so much to refer to what was usual, as to form a comparison suitable to his purpose; and this is what our Savior in his parables had sometimes done. Contrary to what the case is in nature, the Apostle makes the stock good and the graft bad, and makes the stock to communicate its goodness to the graft and to improve the quality of its fruit. But his main object is to show the fact of incision, without any regard to the character of the stock and of the graft in natural things; for both <em>his </em>stock and <em>his </em>graft are of a different character. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
