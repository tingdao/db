<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here confirms what he had said before, namely, that there was no intrinsic motion in the wheels, but that they were drawn by a secret instinct wherever the cherubim moved themselves. Hence we gather that the events of things are not accidental, nor excited in various directions by <em>any </em>blind impulse, but directed by the hidden energy of God, and that too by means of angels. First he says, <em>when the cherubim set out, the wheels set out at the same time: </em>then <em>when the cherubim raised their wings upwards, the wheels followed the same course, and did not return; </em>that is, were not drawn aside from that agreement of which he had spoken before; but how the wheels were not reversed, we shall explain more clearly to-morrow. </p></div>
