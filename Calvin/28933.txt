<div class="comment-content"><p>As, in the event of the Corinthians retaining any feeling of offense, occasioned by the severity of the preceding Epistle, that might stand in the way of Paul’s authority having influence over them, he has hitherto made it his endeavor to conciliate their affections. Now, after clearing away all occasion of offense, and regaining favor for his ministry, he recommends to them the brethren at Jerusalem, that they may furnish help to their necessities. He could not, with any great advantage, have attempted this in the commencement of the Epistle. Hence, he has prudently deferred it, until he has prepared their minds for it. Accordingly, he takes up the whole of this chapter, and the next, in exhorting the Corinthians to be active and diligent in collecting alms to be taken to Jerusalem for relieving the indigence of the brethren. For they were afflicted with a great famine, so that they could scarcely support life without being aided by other churches. The Apostles had intrusted Paul with this matter, (<span class="bvs">Gal_2:10</span>,) and he had promised to concern himself in reference to it, and he had already done so in part, as we have seen in the former Epistle. <span class="cite-ref">(659)</span> Now, however, he presses them still farther. </p><p><strong>1.</strong><em>I make known to you. </em>He commends the Macedonians, but it is with the design of stimulating the Corinthians by their example, although he does not expressly say so; for the former had no need of commendation, but the latter had need of a stimulus. And that he may stir up the Corinthians the more to emulation, he ascribes it to the<em>grace of God </em>that the Macedonians had been so forward to give help to their brethren. For although it is acknowledged by all, that it is a commendable virtue to give help to the needy, they, nevertheless, do not reckon it to be a gain, nor do they look upon it as the <em>grace of God </em>Nay rather, they reckon, that it is so much of what was theirs taken from them, and lost. Paul, on the other hand, declares, that we ought to ascribe it to the grace of God, when we afford aid to our brethren, and that it ought to be desired by us as a privilege of no ordinary kind. </p><p>He makes mention, however, of a twofold favor, that had been conferred upon the Macedonians. The <em>first </em>is, that they had endured afflictions with composure and cheerfulness. The <em>second </em>is, that from their slender means, equally as though they had possessed abundance, <span class="cite-ref">(660)</span> they had taken something — to be laid out upon their brethren. Each of these things, Paul affirms with good reason, is a work of the Lord, for all quickly fail, that are not upheld by the Spirit of God, who is the Author of all consolation, and distrust clings to us, deeply rooted, which keeps us back from all offices of love, until it is subdued by the grace of the same Spirit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(659)</span> “See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 2, pp. 67-70. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(660)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’aussi bon coeur qu’ils eussent este bien riches</span>;” — “As heartily as if they had been very rich.” </p></div></div>
