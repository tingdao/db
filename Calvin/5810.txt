Hence those mournful complaints of David and Hezekiah, and others elsewhere, when their life is taken from them by all angry God: </p><p>“the grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_38:18</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_6:5</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_115:17</span>.) </p><p>Surely it was not so formidable a thing for them to die, but that they would have calmly and cheerfully departed from the world when their time came; but what they deprecated was the awful judgment of God, at the thoughts of which they were alarmed. The same grief might have overwhelmed the mind of Moses, had it not been alleviated. </p><p>But since none, however eminent, have been altogether exempt from temporal punishments, let us learn to bear them patiently. God did not spare Moses; what wonder if our condition is no better than his? Moreover, in the opinion of men it was a trifling offense, for the sake of which he was so severely chastised; for, carried away by indignation, he had been so irritated against the people that he had attributed less power to God that was due to Him. Now, those errors, into which we fall through thoughtless impetuosity, are more easily pardoned; but hence it is manifest; how precious to God is His glory, when He does not suffer it to be obscured with impunity even by inadvertence. At the same time, also, we are taught that nothing is more irrational than to assume to ourselves the judgment respecting sins, and to weigh them in our own balance, when God is their only legitimate assessor. </p><p>But, although He declares that Moses and Aaron revolted, and were rebellious “to His mouth,” <span class="cite-ref">(303)</span> still, lest it should be thought that they studiously refused credence to God’s word, a kind of qualification is added, viz., that they did not <em>sanctify </em>God in the midst, or <em>before the eyes, </em>of the children of Israel. Hence it. is plain that they were only condemned for the excessive violence of their passion, whereby they did not uphold God’s glory before the people with sufficient energy. </p><p>As to the rest, it may be looked for under <span class="bvs">Num_20:0</span>. </p><p><strong>(302)</strong> “Que nous avons veu;” as we have seen. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(303)</strong><span class="bvs">Num_27:11</span>. “Against my commandment.” — <em>A.
