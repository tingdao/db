<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>For </em><span class="cite-ref">(39)</span><em>the righteousness of God, etc. </em>This is an explanation and a confirmation of the preceding clause — that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation. For if we seek salvation, that is, life with God, righteousness must be first sought, by which being reconciled to him, we may, through him being propitious to us, obtain that life which consists only in his favor; for, in order to be loved by God, we must first become righteous, since he regards unrighteousness with hatred. He therefore intimates, that we cannot obtain salvation otherwise than from the gospel, since nowhere else does God reveal to us his righteousness, which alone delivers us from perdition. Now this righteousness, which is the groundwork of our salvation, is revealed in the gospel: hence the gospel is said to be the power of God unto salvation. Thus he reasons from the cause to the effect. </p><p>Notice further, how extraordinary and valuable a treasure does God bestow on us through the gospel, even the communication of his own righteousness. I take the righteousness of God to mean, that which is approved before his tribunal; <span class="cite-ref">(40)</span> as that, on the contrary, is usually called the righteousness of men, which is by men counted and supposed to be righteousness, though it be only vapor. Paul, however, I doubt not, alludes to the many prophecies in which the Spirit makes known everywhere the righteousness of God in the future kingdom of Christ. </p><p>Some explain it as the righteousness which is freely given us by God: and I indeed confess that the words will bear this sense; for God justifies us by the gospel, and thus saves us: yet the former view seems to me more suitable, though it is not what I make much of. Of greater moment is what some think, that this righteousness does not only consist in the free remission of sins, but also, in part, includes the grace of regeneration. But I consider, that we are restored to life because God freely reconciles us to himself, as we shall hereafter show in its proper place. </p><p>But instead of the expression he used before, “to every one who believeth,” he says now, <em>from faith; </em>for righteousness is offered by the gospel, and is received by faith. And he adds, <em>to faith</em>: for as our faith makes progress, and as it advances in knowledge, so the righteousness of God increases in us at the same time, and the possession of it is in a manner confirmed. When at first we taste the gospel, we indeed see God’s smiling countenance turned towards us, but at a distance: the more the knowledge of true religion grows in us, by coming as it were nearer, we behold God’s favor more clearly and more familiarly. What some think, that there is here an implied comparison between the Old and New Testament, is more refined than well-founded; for Paul does not here compare the Fathers who lived under the law with us, but points out the daily progress that is made by every one of the faithful. </p><p><em>As it is written</em>, <em>etc. </em>By the authority of the Prophet Habakkuk he proves the righteousness of faith; for he, predicting the overthrow of the proud, adds this — that the life of the righteous consists in faith. Now we live not before God, except through righteousness: it then follows, that our righteousness is obtained by faith; and the verb being future, designates the real perpetuity of that life of which he speaks; as though he had said, — that it would not be momentary, but continue forever. For even the ungodly swell with the false notion of having life; but when they say, “Peace and safety,” a sudden destruction comes upon them, (<span class="bvs">1Th_5:3</span>.) It is therefore a shadow, which endures only for a moment. Faith alone is that which secures the perpetuity of life; and whence is this, except that it leads us to God, and makes our life to depend on him? For Paul would not have aptly quoted this testimony had not the meaning of the Prophet been, that we then only stand, when by faith we recumb on God: and he has not certainly ascribed life to the faith of the godly, but in as far as they, having renounced the arrogance of the world, resign themselves to the protection of God alone. <span class="cite-ref">(41)</span></p><p>He does not indeed professedly handle this subject; and hence he makes no mention of gratuitous justification: but it is sufficiently evident from the nature of faith, that this testimony is rightly applied to the present subject. Besides, we necessarily gather from his reasoning, that there is a mutual connection between faith and the gospel: for as the just is said to live by faith, he concludes that this life is received by the gospel. </p><p>We have now the principal point or the main hinge of the first part of this Epistle, — that we are justified by faith through the mercy of God alone. We have not this, indeed as yet distinctly expressed by Paul; but from his own words it will hereafter be made very clear — that the righteousness, which is grounded on faith, depends entirely on the mercy of God. </p><p><strong>(39)</strong> “The causative<span class="lang el-gr">, γὰρ, </span> indicates a connection with the preceding, that the gospel is the power of God: the reason is, because by the gospel is revealed the righteousness of God, that is, made known by it is a way of righteousness and of obtaining life before God, which neither the law, nor philosophy, nor any other doctrine, was able to show.” — [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] </p><p><strong>(40)</strong> “The righteousness of God<span class="lang el-gr">,” δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ, </span> has been the occasion of much toil to critics, but without reason: the very context is sufficient to show its meaning, it being what the gospel reveals, and what the gospel reveals is abundantly known from other passages. Whether we saw, it is the righteousness which is approved of God, as [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] says, or provided by God, or contrived by God, or imputed by God, the meaning does not materially differ, and indeed all these things, as it is evident from Scripture, are true respecting it. </p><p>There is more difficulty connected with the following words<span class="lang el-gr">, ἐκ πίστεως εἰς πίστιν. </span> The view which [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] gives was adopted by some of the Fathers, such as [<span class="bvs">Theophylact </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Clemens Alexandrinus </span>]; and it is that of [<span class="bvs">Melancthon </span>], [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>], [<span class="bvs">Scaliger </span>], [<span class="bvs">Locke </span>], and many others. From [<span class="bvs">Poole </span>] we find that [<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>] gave this exposition, “From the obscure and inchoate faith of the Old Testament to the clear and full faith of the New;” and that [<span class="bvs">Ambrose </span>] <em>’s </em>exposition was the following, “From the faith or fidelity of God who promises to the faith of him who believes.” But in all these views there is not that which comports with the context, nor the construction very intelligible-”revealed from faith,” What can it mean? To render the passage intelligibly<span class="lang el-gr">, ἐκ πίστεως </span> must be connected with <span class="lang el-gr">δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ, </span> as suggested by [<span class="bvs">Hammond </span>], and followed by [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>]. Then it would be, “The righteousness of God by faith or, <em>which is </em>by faith:” this is revealed in the gospel “to faith,” that is, in order that it may be believed; which is often the force of<span class="lang el-gr">εἰς </span> before a noun; as, <span class="lang el-gr">εἰς τὴν ἀνομίαν </span> — in order to do wickedness; or, <span class="lang el-gr">εἰς ἁγιασμόν </span> in order to practice holiness, <span class="bvs">Rom_6:19</span> [<span class="bvs">Chalmers </span>], [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>], [<span class="bvs">Barnes </span>], and [<span class="bvs">Haldane </span>] take this view. The verse may be thus rendered, — </p><p>For the righteousness of God by faith is in it revealed in order to be believed, as it is written, “The just shall by faith live.” The same truth is conveyed in <span class="bvs">Rom_3:22</span>; and similar phraseology is found in <span class="bvs">Phi_3:9</span>. </p><p>[<span class="bvs">Barnes </span>] seems fully to express the import of the passage in these words, “God’s plan of justifying men is revealed in the gospel, which plan is by faith, and the benefits of which plan shall be extended to all that have faith or that believe.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(41)</strong> Here is an instance in which Paul quotes the Old Testament, [<span class="bvs">Hab_2:4</span> ] neither exactly from the Hebrew nor the Septuagint. The Hebrew is “the just, — by his faith shall he live,” <span class="lang he-il">וצדיק באמונתו היה</span> : and the Septuagint, turns “his” into “my<span class="lang el-gr">,” ὁ δὲ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεως μοῦ ζήσεται </span> — “The just shall by my faith live,” — “by my faith,” that is, according to the tenor of the passage, “by faith in me.” The passage is quoted by him twice besides, in <span class="bvs">Gal_3:11</span>, and in <span class="bvs">Heb_10:38</span>, but exactly in the same words, without the pronoun “his” or “my.” His object in this, as in some similar instances, was to state the general truth contained in the passage, and not to give a strictly verbal quotation. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
