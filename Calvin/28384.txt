<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>For since the world knew not. </em>The right order of things was assuredly this, that man, contemplating the wisdom of God in his works, by the light of the understanding furnished him by nature, might arrive at an acquaintance with him. As, however, this order of things has been reversed through man’s depravity, God designs in the first place to make us see ourselves to be fools, before <em>he makes us wise unto salvation</em>, (<span class="bvs">2Ti_3:15</span>;) and secondly, as a token of his wisdom, he presents to us what has some appearance of folly. This inversion of the order of things the ingratitude of mankind deserved. By <em>the wisdom of God </em>he means the workmanship of the whole world, which is an illustrious token and clear manifestation of his wisdom: God therefore presents before us in his creatures a bright mirror of his admirable wisdom, so that every one that looks upon the world, and the other works of God, must of necessity break forth in admiration of him, if he has a single spark of sound judgment. If men were guided to a right knowledge of God by the contemplation of his works, they would know God in the exercise of wisdom, or by a natural and proper method of acquiring wisdom; but as the whole world gained nothing in point of instruction from the circumstance, that God had exhibited his wisdom in his creatures, he then resorted to another method for instructing men. <span class="cite-ref">(90)</span> Thus it must be reckoned as our own fault, that we do not attain a saving acquaintance with God, before we have been emptied of our own understanding. </p><p>He makes a concession when he calls the gospel<em>the foolishness of preaching</em>, having that appearance in the view of those foolish sages (<span class="lang el-gr">μωροσόφοις</span>) who, intoxicated with false confidence, <span class="cite-ref">(91)</span> fear not to subject God’s sacred truth to their senseless criticism. And indeed in another point of view nothing is more absurd in the view, of human reason than to hear that God has become mortal — that life has been subjected to death — that righteousness has been veiled under the appearance of sin — and that the source of blessing has been made subject to the curse, that by this means men might be redeemed from death, and become partakers of a blessed immortality — that they might obtain life — that, sin being destroyed, righteousness might reign — and that death and the curse might be swallowed up. We know, nevertheless, in the meantime, that the gospel is <em>the hidden wisdom</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Co_2:7</span>,) which in its height surmounts the heavens, and at which angels themselves stand amazed. Here we have a most beautiful passage, from which we may see how great is the blindness of the human mind, which in the midst of light discerns nothing. For it is true, that this world is like a theater, in which the Lord presents to us a clear manifestation of his glory, and yet, notwithstanding that we have such a spectacle placed before our eyes, we are stone-blind, not because the manifestation is furnished obscurely, but because we are <em>alienated in mind</em>, (<span class="bvs">Col_1:21</span>,)and for this matter we lack not merely inclination but ability. For notwithstanding that God shows himself openly, it is only with the eye of faith that we can behold him, save only that we receive a slight perception of his divinity, sufficient to render us inexcusable. </p><p>Accordingly, when Paul here declares that God is not known through means of his creatures, you must understand him to mean that a pure knowledge of him is not attained. For that none may have any pretext for ignorance, mankind make proficiency in the universal school of nature; so far as to be affected with some perception of deity, but what God is, they know not, nay more, they straightway become vain in their imaginations, (<span class="bvs">Rom_1:21</span>.) Thus the light shineth in darkness, (<span class="bvs">Joh_1:5</span>.) It follows, then, that mankind do not err thus far through mere ignorance, so as not to be chargeable with contempt, negligence, and ingratitude. Thus it holds good, that all </p><p>have known God, and yet have not glorified him, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_1:21</span>,) </p><p>and that, on the other hand, no one under the guidance of mere nature ever made such proficiency as to know God. Should any one bring forward the philosophers as exceptions, I answer, that in them more especially there is presented a signal token of this our <em>weakness. </em>For there will not be found one of them, that has not from that first principle of knowledge, which I have mentioned, straightway turned aside into wandering <span class="cite-ref">(92)</span> and erroneous speculations, and for the most part they betray a silliness worse than that of old wives. When he says, that <em>those are saved that believe</em>, this corresponds with the foregoing statement — that the gospel is<em>the power of God unto salvation </em>Farther, by contrasting believers, whose number is small, with a blind and senseless world, he teaches us that we err if we stumble at the smallness of their number, inasmuch as they have been divinely set apart to salvation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(90)</span> The reader will find the same train of thought as above in the <em>Institutes</em>, volume 1. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(91)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et outrecuidance</span>;” — “And presumption.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(92)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Extrauagantes</span>;” — “Extravagant.” </p></div></div>
