<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36</strong><em>Did the word of God come out from you? </em>This is a somewhat sharper reproof, but nothing more than was needful for beating down the haughtiness of the Corinthians. They were, beyond measure, self-complacent. They could not endure that either themselves, or what belonged to them, should be found fault with in anything. He asks, accordingly, whether they are the only Christians in the world; nay, farther, whether they are the first, or are to be the last? <em>“Did the word of God,” </em>says he, <em>“come out from you?” </em>that is, <em>“Did </em>it originate with you<em>?” “Has </em>it ended with you?” that is, <em>“Will </em>it spread no farther<em>?” </em>The design of the admonition is this — that they may not, without having any regard to others, please themselves in their own contrivances or customs. And this is a doctrine of general application; for no Church should be taken up with itself exclusively, to the neglect of others; but on the contrary, they ought all, in their turn, to hold out the right hand to each other, in the way of cherishing mutual fellowship, and accommodating themselves to each other, in so far as a regard to harmony requires. <span class="cite-ref">(883)</span></p><p>But here it is asked, whether every Church, according as it has had the precedence of another in the order of time, <span class="cite-ref">(884)</span> has it also in its power to bind it to observe its institutions. <span class="cite-ref">(885)</span> For Paul seems to intimate this in what he says. For example, Jerusalem was the mother of all the Churches, inasmuch as <em>the word of the Lord had come out from it </em>Was she then at liberty to assume to herself a superior right, so as to bind all others to follow her? I answer, that Paul here does not employ an argument of universal application, but one that was specially applicable to the Corinthians, as is frequently the case. He had, therefore, an eye to individuals, rather than to the thing itself. Hence it does not necessarily follow, that Churches that are of later origin must be bound to observe, in every point, the institutions of the earlier ones, inasmuch as even Paul himself did not bind himself by this rule, so as to obtrude upon other Churches the customs that were in use at Jerusalem. Let there be nothing of ambition — let there be nothing of obstinacy — let there be nothing of pride and contempt for other Churches — let there be, on the other hand, a desire to edify — let there be moderation and prudence; and in that case, amidst a diversity of observances, there will be nothing that is worthy of reproof. </p><p>Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that the haughtiness of the Corinthians is here reproved, who, concerned for themselves exclusively, <span class="cite-ref">(886)</span> showed no respect to the Churches of earlier origin, from which they had received the gospel, and did not endeavor to accommodate themselves to other Churches, to which the gospel had flowed out from them. Would to God that there were no Corinth in our times, in respect of this fault, as well as of others! But we see how savage men, who have <em>never tasted </em>the gospel, (<span class="bvs">Heb_6:5</span>,) trouble the Churches of the saints by a tyrannical enforcement of their own laws. <span class="cite-ref">(887)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(883)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Autant qu’il est requis pour nourrir paix et concorde</span>;” — “in so far as it is requisite for maintaining peace and harmony.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(884)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et est plus ancienne</span>;” — “And is more ancient.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(885)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A ses ordonnances et manieres de faire</span>;” — “To its ordinances and methods of acting.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(886)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne regardans qu’a eux mesmes, et se plaisans en leur facons de faire</span>;” — “Looking only to themselves, and pleasing themselves in their modes of acting.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(887)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En voulant d’vne faqon tyrannique contraindre tout le monde a receuoir leurs loix</span>;” — “By endeavoring, in a tyrannical way, to constrain every one to receive their laws.” </p></div></div>
