<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>What concord has Christ with Belial? </em>As to the etymology of the word <em>Belial, </em>even the Hebrews themselves are not agreed <span class="cite-ref">(612)</span> The meaning, however, is not doubtful. <span class="cite-ref">(613)</span> For Moses takes a word or thought of <em>Belial </em><span class="cite-ref">(614)</span> to mean a wicked and base thought, <span class="cite-ref">(615)</span> and in various instances <span class="cite-ref">(616)</span> those who are wicked and abandoned to iniquity, are called <em>men, </em>or <em>sons of Belial. </em>(<span class="bvs">Deu_13:13</span>; <span class="bvs">Jud_19:22</span>; <span class="bvs">1Sa_2:12</span>.) Hence it is, that Paul has employed the word here to mean the devil, the head of all wicked persons. For from what holds good as to the two heads, he comes down without delay to the members: “As there is an irreconcilable variance between Christ and Satan, so we also must keep aloof from partnership with the wicked.” When, however, Paul says that a Christian has no participation with an unbeliever, he does not mean as to food, clothing, estates, the sun, the air, as I have mentioned above, but as to those things that are peculiar to unbelievers, from which the Lord has separated us. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(612)</span><em>Beza</em>, when mentioning the different views which have been taken of the etymology of the term <em>Belial</em>, remarks, that some derive it from <span class="lang he-il">בלי יעל</span><em>beli jahal</em>, (<em>not profitable</em>,) or from <span class="lang he-il">בלי מועיל</span><em>beli mohil</em>, (<em>worthless</em>,) and that the term, viewed as having this derivation, is peculiarly appropriate to Satan, as being diametrically opposed to Christ, the Greatest and Best; while Jerome derives it from <span class="lang he-il">בלי</span><em>beli</em>, (<em>not</em>) and <span class="lang he-il">עיל</span><em>hol</em>, (<em>a yoke</em>,) as though you should say — <em>without a yoke, not subject to the yoke</em>. Beza gives the preference to the <em>former </em>etymology, while he observes that the <em>latter </em>is also most appropriate to Satan as an <em>apostate </em>spirit. — The original term <em>Belial </em>is rendered in various instances in the Septuagint <span class="lang el-gr">παράνομος</span>, <em>lawless</em>. — There is here a slight variation in reading.
