<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>47.</strong><em>If any man hear my words. </em>After having spoken concerning his grace, and exhorted his disciples to steady faith, he now begins to strike the rebellious, though even here he mitigates the severity due to the wickedness of those who deliberately — as it were — reject God; for he delays to pronounce <em>judgment </em>on them, because, on the contrary, he has come for the salvation of all. In the first place, we ought to understand that he does not speak here of all unbelievers without distinction, but of those who, knowingly and willingly, reject the doctrine of the Gospel which has been exhibited to them. Why then does Christ not choose to condemn them? It is because he lays aside for a time the office of a <em>judge</em>, and offers salvation to all without reserve, and stretches out his arms to embrace all, that all may be the more encouraged to repent. And yet there is a circumstance of no small moment, by which he points out the aggravation of the crime, if they reject an invitation so kind and gracious, for it is as if he had said, “Lo, I am here to invite all, and, forgetting the character of a judge, I have this as my single object, to persuade all, and to rescue from destruction those who are already twice ruined.” No man, therefore, is condemned on account of having despised the Gospel, except he who, disdaining the lovely message of salvation, has chosen of his own accord to draw down destruction on himself. </p><p>The word <em>judge, </em>as is evident from the word save, which is contrasted with it, here signifies to <em>condemn</em>. Now this ought to be understood as referring to the office which properly and naturally belongs to Christ; for that unbelievers are not more severely <em>condemned </em>on account of the Gospel is accidental, and does not arise from its nature, as we have said on former occasions. </p></div>
