<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>As a man </em><span class="cite-ref">(224)</span><em>whom his mother comforteth. </em>It is wonderful that the Prophet, who appeared to have already spoken enough about this renewal, dwells on it so largely. But, because he can neither express the greatness and warmth of the love which God bears toward us, nor satisfy himself with speaking about it, for that reason he mentions and repeats it frequently. </p><p><em>And you shall have consolation in Jerusalem. </em>There are two ways in which this may be explained. It may be said that believers shall have joyful hearts, when they shall behold the Church restored; or, that the Church, after having been restored, shall discharge her duty by gladdening her children. I prefer the latter interpretation, though either of them is admissible. The former appears to be a richer interpretation; but we must consider what the Prophet meant, and not what we think the most beautiful. In the first place, indeed, he makes God the author of the joy, and justly; but, in the second place, he adds that Jerusalem is his handmaid. But this is not addressed to irreligious scorners, who are not moved by any solicitude about the Church, but to those who, with holy zeal, declare that they are her children. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(224)</span> “The English version, which in multitudes of cases inserts ‘man’ where the original expression is indefinite, (translating <span class="lang el-gr">οὐδείς</span>, for example, always ‘no man’) here reverses the process, and dilutes ‘a man’ to ‘one.’ The same liberty is taken by many other versions, old and new, occasioned no doubt by a feeling of the incongruity of making a full-grown man the subject of maternal consolations. The difficulty might, if it were necessary, be avoided by explaining <span class="lang he-il">איש</span> (<em>ish</em>) to mean a man-child, as it does in <span class="bvs">Gen_4:1</span>; <span class="bvs">1Sa_1:11</span>; and in many other cases. But the truth is, that the solecism, which has been so carefully expunged by these translators, is an exquisite trait of patriarchal manners, in their primitive simplicity. Compare <span class="bvs">Gen_24:67</span>; <span class="bvs">Jud_17:2</span>; <span class="bvs">1Kg_2:19</span>, and the affecting scenes between Thetis and Achilles in the Iliad.” — <em>Alexander. </em></p></div></div>
