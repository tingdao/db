<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Last of all to me, as to one born prematurely, </em>He now introduces himself along with the others, for Christ had manifested himself to him as alive, and invested with glory. <span class="cite-ref">(20)</span> As it was no deceptive vision, it was calculated to be of use <span class="cite-ref">(21)</span> for establishing a belief in the resurrection, as he also makes use of this argument in <span class="bvs">Act_26:8</span>. But as it was of no small importance that his authority should have the greatest weight and influence among the Corinthians, he introduces, by the way, a commendation of himself personally, but at the same time qualified in such a manner that, while he claims much for himself, he is at the same time exceedingly modest. Lest any one, therefore, should meet him with the objection: “Who art thou that we should give credit to thee?” he, of his own accord, confesses his unworthiness, and, in the first place, indeed he compares himself to one that is <em>born prematurely, </em>and that, in my opinion, with reference to his sudden conversion. For as infants do not come forth from the womb, until they have been there formed and matured during a regular course of time, so the Lord observed a regular period of time in creating, nourishing, and forming his Apostles. Paul, on the other hand, had been cast forth from the womb when he had scarcely received the vital spark. <span class="cite-ref">(22)</span> There are some that understand the term rendered <em>abortive </em>as employed to mean <em>posthumous; </em><span class="cite-ref">(23)</span> but the former term is much more suitable, inasmuch as he was in one moment begotten, and born, and a man of full age. Now this premature birth renders the grace of God more illustrious in Paul than if he had by little and little, and by <em>successive </em>steps, grown up to maturity in Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(20)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En sa vie et gloire immortelle</span>;” — “In his life and immortal glory.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(21)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Elle estoit suffisante et receuable</span>;” — “It was sufficient and admissible.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(22)</span> In accordance with the view taken by Calvin, <em>Bloomfield </em>considers the original term. <span class="lang el-gr">ἔκτρωμα</span> to mean, <em>a child born before the due time, (in </em>which sense the term <em>abortivus, </em>is employed by Horace, Sat. 1:3.46,) the Apostle “calling himself so as being an Apostle not formed and matured by previous preparation and instruction.” <em>Penn, </em>after quoting the definition given by Eustathius of the term <span class="lang el-gr">ἔκτρωμα </span> — <span class="lang el-gr">τὸ μήπω τετυπώμενον</span> — <em>an unformed foetus, </em>remarks: “To all the other Apostles our Lord appeared after his resurrection, when they had attained their <em>adult form </em>in his ministry; but to St. Paul he appeared at the first moment of his spiritual conception, and <em>before he was formed or moulded.” </em>The same view, in substance, is given by <em>McKnight. </em>“Although he” (Paul) “calls himself <em>an abortive Apostle, </em>it was not on account of his being sensible of any imperfection in his commission, or of any weakness in his qualifications as an Apostle; for he affirms, <span class="bvs">2Co_11:5</span>, that he was <em>in nothing behind the very greatest of the Apostles; </em>but he called himself an <em>abortive Apostle, </em>because, as he tells us (<span class="bvs">1Co_15:9</span>,) he <em>had persecuted the Church of God, </em>and because he was made an Apostle without that previous course of instruction and preparation, which the other Apostles enjoyed who had attended Jesus Christ during his ministry on earth; so that, in the proper sense of the word, he was <span class="lang el-gr">ἔκτρωμα</span> — born before he was brought to maturity. That want, however, was abundantly supplied by the many revelations which his master gave him after he made him an Apostle.” — Ed. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(23)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire qui est nay apres la mort de son pete</span><em>;” </em>— <em>“ </em>That is to say, one that is born after the death of his father.” </p></div></div>
