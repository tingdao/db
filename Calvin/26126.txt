<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Unless a man be born of water. </em>This passage has been explained in various ways. Some have thought that the two parts of regeneration are distinctly pointed out, and that by the word <em>Water </em>is denoted the renunciation of the old man, while by <em>the Spirit </em>they have understood the new life. Others think that there is an implied contrast, as if Christ intended to contrast <em>Water and Spirit</em>, which are pure and liquid elements, with the earthly and gross nature of man. Thus they view the language as allegorical, and suppose Christ to have taught that we ought to lay aside the heavy and ponderous mass of the flesh, and to become like <em>water and air</em>, that we may move upwards, or, at least, may not be so much weighed down to the earth. But both opinions appear to me to be at variance with the meaning of Christ. </p><p><em>Chrysostom</em>, with whom the greater part of expounders agree, makes the word <em>Water </em>refer to baptism. The meaning would then be, that by baptism we enter into the kingdom of God, because in baptism we are regenerated by the Spirit of God. Hence arose the belief of the absolute necessity of baptism, in order to the hope of eternal life. But though we were to admit that Christ here speaks of baptism, yet we ought not to press his words so closely as to imagine that he confines salvation to the outward sign; but, on the contrary, he connects the <em>Water </em>with the <em>Spirit</em>, because under that visible symbol he attests and seals that newness of life which God alone produces in us by his Spirit. It is true that, by neglecting baptism, we are excluded from salvation; and in this sense I acknowledge that it is necessary; but it is absurd to speak of the hope of salvation as confined to the sign. So far as relates to this passage, I cannot bring myself to believe that Christ speaks of baptism; for it would have been inappropriate. </p><p>We must always keep in remembrance the design of Christ, which we have already explained; namely, that he intended to exhort Nicodemus to newness of life, because he was not capable of receiving the Gospel, until he began to be a new man. It is, therefore, a simple statement, that we must be born again, in order that we may be the children of God, and that the Holy Spirit is the Author of this second birth. For while Nicodemus was dreaming of the regeneration (<span class="lang el-gr">παλιγγενεσία</span>) or transmigration taught by Pythagoras, who imagined that souls, after the death of their bodies, passed into other bodies, <span class="cite-ref">(58)</span> Christ, in order to cure him of this error, added, by way of explanation, that it is not in a natural way that men <em>are born a second time</em>, and that it is not necessary for them to be clothed with a new body, but that they are <em>born </em>when they are renewed in mind and heart by the grace of the Spirit. </p><p>Accordingly, he employed the words <em>Spirit </em>and <em>water </em>to mean the same thing, and this ought not to be regarded as a harsh or forced interpretation; for it is a frequent and common way of speaking in Scripture, when <em>the Spirit </em>is mentioned, to add the word <em>Water </em>or <em>Fire</em>, expressing his power. We sometimes meet with the statement, that it is Christ who <em>baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and with fire</em>, (<span class="bvs">Mat_3:11</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_3:16</span>,) where <em>fire </em>means nothing different from the Spirit, but only shows what is his efficacy in us. As to the word <em>water </em>being placed first, it is of little consequence; or rather, this mode of speaking flows more naturally than the other, because the metaphor is followed by a plain and direct statement, as if Christ had said that no man is a son of God until he has been renewed by <em>water</em>, and that this <em>water </em>is <em>the Spirit </em>who cleanseth us anew and who, by spreading his energy over us, imparts to us the rigor of the heavenly life, though by nature we are utterly dry. And most properly does Christ, in order to reprove Nicodemus for his ignorance, employ a form of expression which is common in Scripture; for Nicodemus ought at length to have acknowledged, that what Christ had said was taken from the ordinary doctrine of the Prophets. </p><p>By <em>water</em>, therefore, is meant nothing more than the inward purification and invigoration which is produced by <em>the Holy Spirit</em>. Besides, it is not unusual to employ the word <em>and </em>instead of <em>that is</em>, when the latter clause is intended to explain the former. And the view which I have taken is supported by what follows; for when Christ immediately proceeds to assign the reason why we <em>must be born again</em>, without mentioning the <em>water</em>, he shows that the newness of life which he requires is produced by the <em>Spirit </em>alone; whence it follows, that <em>water </em>must not be separated from <em>the Spirit </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(58)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui imaginoit que los ames apres la mort de leurs corps cntroyent dedans des autres corps</span>.” </p></div></div>
