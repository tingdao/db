And in the first place, he makes mention of the glory of his <em>descent, </em>of which his rivals chiefly vaunted. “If,” says he, “they boast of illustrious <em>descent, </em>I shall be on a level with them, for I also am an <em>Israelite, </em>of the <em>seed of Abraham.” </em>This is a silly and empty boast, and yet Paul makes use of <em>three </em>terms to express it; nay more, he specifies, as it were, <em>three </em>different marks of excellence. By this repetition, in my opinion, he indirectly reproves their folly, inasmuch as they placed the sum-total <span class="cite-ref">(852)</span> of their excellence in a thing that was so trivial, <span class="cite-ref">(853)</span> and this boasting was incessantly in their mouth, so as to be absolutely disgusting, as vain men are accustomed to pour forth empty bravadoes as to a mere nothing. </p><p>As to the term <em>Hebrews, </em>it appears from <span class="bvs">Gen_11:15</span>, that it denotes descent, and is derived from <em>Heber; </em>and farther, it is probable, that Abraham himself is so called in <span class="bvs">Gen_14:13</span>, in no other sense than this — that he was descended from that ancestor. <span class="cite-ref">(854)</span> Not altogether without some appearance of truth is the conjecture of those, who explain the term to mean <em>those dwelling beyond the river. </em><span class="cite-ref">(855)</span> We do not read, it is true, that any one was called so before Abraham, who had <em>passed over the river, </em>when he quitted his native country, and afterwards the appellation came to be a customary one among his posterity, as appears from the history of Joseph. The termination, however, shows that it is expressive of descent, and the passage, that I have quoted, abundantly confirms it. <span class="cite-ref">(856)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(852)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Proram et puppim</span>;” — “The prow and stern.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(853)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Vne chose si vaine, et de si petite consequence</span>;” — “A thing so empty, and of so small importance.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(854)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il estoit descendu d’Heber de pere en fils</span>;” — “That he was descended from Heber, from father to son.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(855)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Vray est que la coniecture de ceux qui disent qu’ils sont ainsi appelez comme </span><em class="lang fr-fr">habitants outre la riuiere, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">n’est pas du tout sans eouleur</span>;” — “It is true, that the conjecture of those who say that they are so called, as <em>dwelling beyond the river, </em>is not without some appearance of truth.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(856)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>The word Hebrew signified properly <em>one who was from beyond, </em>(<span class="lang he-il">עכרי</span> from <span class="lang he-il">עכר</span> to <em>pass, </em>to <em>pass over,</em>) hence applied to Abraham, because he had come from a foreign land; and the word denoted properly a <em>foreigner </em>— <em>a </em>man from the land or country <em>beyond </em>(<span class="lang he-il">עכר</span>) the Euphrates. The name Israelite denoted properly one descended from Israel or Jacob, and the difference between them was, that the name Israelite, being a patronymic derived from one of the founders of their nation, was in use among themselves; the name <em>Hebrew </em>was applied by the Canaanite to them, as having come from <em>beyond </em>the river, and was the current name among foreign tribes and nations.” — <em>Barnes. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
