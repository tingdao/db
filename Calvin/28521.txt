<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>The unmarried woman and the virgin. </em>What he had laid down as to men he now declares in like manner as to women — that virgins and widows are not prevented by earthly things from devoting their whole cares and their whole affections to God. Not that all act this part, but that there is opportunity for it, if the mind is so disposed. When he says, <em>that she may be holy in body and in spirit</em>, he shows what kind of chastity is true and acceptable to God — when the mind is kept unpolluted in the sight of God. Would to God that this were more carefully attended to! As to <em>the body, </em>we see what kind of devotement to the Lord there commonly is on the part of monks, nuns, and the whole scum of the Papistical clergy, than whose celibacy nothing can be imagined that is more obscene. <span class="cite-ref">(435)</span> But not to speak at present of chastity of <em>body</em>, where is there one to be found among those that are held in admiration in consequence of their reputation for continency, that does not burn with base lusts? We may, however, infer from this statement of Paul, that no chastity is well pleasing to God that does not extend to the <em>soul </em>as well as to the <em>body </em>Would to God that those who prate in such haughty terms as to continency, did but understand that they have to do with God! They would not be so confident in their contendings with us. At the same time, there are none in the present day who dispute on the subject of continency in more magnificent style than those who are openly and in the most shameless manner guilty of fornication. But though they should conduct themselves ever so honorably in the sight of men, that is nothing, if they do not keep their minds pure and exempt from all uncleanness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(435)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Plus infame et puante</span>;” — “More infamous and abominable.” </p></div></div>
