<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>But as to times</em>. He now, in the third place, calls them back from a curious and unprofitable inquiry as to <em>times</em>, but in the mean time admonishes them to be constantly in a state of preparation for receiving Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(589)</span> He speaks, however, by way of <em>anticipation</em>, saying, that they have no need that he should write as to those things which the curious desire to know. For it is an evidence of excessive incredulity not to believe what the Lord foretells, unless he marks out the day by certain circumstances, and as it were points it out with the finger. As, therefore, those waver between doubtful opinions who require that moments of time should be marked out for them, as if they would draw a conjecture <span class="cite-ref">(590)</span> from some plausible demonstration, he accordingly says that discussions of this nature are not necessary for the pious. There is also another reason — that believers do not desire to know more than they are permitted to learn in God’s school. Now Christ designed that the day of his coming should be hid from us, that, being in suspense, we might be as it were upon watch. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(589)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand il viendra en iugement</span>;” — “When he will come to judgment.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(590)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De ce qu’ils en doyuent croire</span>;” — “Of what they must believe.” </p></div></div>
