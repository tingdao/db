He therefore declares that the highest honor in the Church is not government, but service. Whoever keeps himself within this limit, whatever may be the title which he bears, takes nothing away either from God or from Christ; as, on the other hand, it serves no good purpose to take the name of a <em>servant </em>for the purpose of cloaking that power which diminishes the authority of Christ as a <em>Master. </em>For of what avail is it that the Pope, when he is about to oppress wretched souls by tyrannical laws, begins with styling himself <em>the servant of servants of God, </em>but to insult God openly, and to practice shameful mockery on men? Now while Christ does not insist on words, he strictly forbids his followers to aspire or desire to rise any higher than to enjoy brotherly intercourse on an equal footing under the heavenly Father, and charges those who occupy places of honor to conduct themselves as the servants of others.
