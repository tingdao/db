<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>Who is he that overcometh the world </em>This is a reason for the previous sentence; that is, we conquer by faith, because we derive strength from Christ; as Paul also says, </p><p>“I can do all things through him that strengtheneth me,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Phi_4:13</span>.) </p><p>He only then can conquer Satan and the world, and not succumb to his own flesh, who, diffident as to himself, recumbs on Christ’s power alone. For by<em>faith </em>he means a real apprehension of Christ, or an effectual laying hold on him, by which we apply his power to ourselves. </p></div>
