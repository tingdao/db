<div class="comment-content"><p>In the fifteenth verse we have first an injunction to prayer, then a promise of its being answered, and afterwards a call to thanksgiving. We are enjoined to pray <em>in the day of trouble, </em>but not with the understanding that we are to pray only then, for prayer is a duty incumbent upon us every day, and every moment of our lives. Be our situation ever so comfortable and exempt from disquietude, we must never cease to engage in the exercise of supplication, remembering that, if God should withdraw his favor for a moment, we would be undone. In affliction, however our faith is more severely tried, and there is a propriety in specifying it as the season of prayer; the prophet pointing us to God as the only resort and means of safety in the day of our urgent necessity. A promise is subjoined to animate us in the duty, disposed as we are to be overwhelmed by a sense of the majesty of God, or of our own unworthiness. Gratitude is next enjoined, in consideration of God’s answer to our prayers. Invocation of the name of God being represented in this passage as constituting a principal part of divine worship, all who make pretensions to piety will feel how necessary it is to preserve the pure and uncorrupted form of it. We are forcibly taught the detestable nature of the error upon this point entertained by the Papists, who transfer to angels and to men an honor which belongs exclusively to God. They may pretend to view these in no other light than as patrons, who pray for them to God. But it is evident that these patrons are impiously substituted by them in the room of Christ, whose mediation they reject. It is apparent, besides, from the form of their prayers, that they recognize no distinction between God and the very least of their saints. They ask the same things from Saint Claudius which they ask from the Almighty, and offer the prayer of our Lord to the image of Catherine. I am aware that the Papists justify their invocation of the dead, by denying that their prayers to them amount to divine worship. They talk so much about the kind of worship which they call <em>latria, </em>that is, the worship which they give to God alone, as to make it appear, that in the invocation of angels and saints they give none of it to them. <span class="cite-ref">(250)</span> But it is impossible to read the words of the Psalmist, now under our consideration, without perceiving that all true religion is gone unless God alone is called upon. Were the Papists asked whether it were lawful to offer sacrifices to the dead, they would immediately reply in the negative. They grant to this day that sacrifice could not lawfully be offered to Peter or to Paul, for the common sense of mankind would dictate the profanity of such an act. And when we here see God preferring the invocation of his name to all sacrifices, is it not plain to demonstration, that those who call upon the dead are chargeable with the grossest impiety? From this it follows, that the Papists, let them abound as they may in their genuflections before God, rob him of the chief part of his glory when they direct their supplications to the saints. <span class="cite-ref">(251)</span> The express mention which is made in these verses of affliction is fitted to comfort the weak and the fearful believer. When God has withdrawn the outward marks of his favor, a doubt is apt to steal into our minds whether he really cares for our salvation. So far is this from being well founded, that adversity is sent to us by God, just to stir us up to seek him and to call upon his name. Nor should we overlook the fact, that our prayers are only acceptable when we offer them in compliance with the commandment of God, and are animated to them by a consideration of the promise which he has extended. The argument which the Papists have drawn from the passage, in support of their multiplied vows, is idle and unwarrantable. The Psalmist, as we have already hinted, when he enjoins the payment of their vows, refers only to solemn thanksgiving, whereas they trust in their vows as meriting salvation. They contract vows, beside, which have no divine warrant, but, on the contrary, are explicitly condemned by the word of God. </p><p><strong>(250)</strong> The Papists have different words by which they express different degrees of worship. The term <span class="lang el-gr">λατρεια</span>, or <em>latria </em>, they say, denotes the divine worship which exclusively belongs to God, and which they yield to him alone; while <span class="lang el-gr">δουλεια</span>, or <em>dulia </em>, signifies that inferior sort of worship which is due to angels and departed saints, and which alone they yield to them. They have also a third degree, which they call <span class="lang el-gr">ὑπερδουλεια</span>, or <em>hyperdulia </em>, that superior kind of inferior worship which they yield to the Virgin Mary. These distinctions are had recourse to, merely to evade the charge of idolatry. But if the Papists yield to angels and glorified saints the honor due only to God, it is of little consequence by what name it is called. Besides, the words <span class="lang el-gr">λατρεαι</span> and <span class="lang el-gr">δουλεαι</span> are used indifferently by classic Greek authors, by the Greek fathers, by the Septuagint, and in the New Testament, to express divine worship. In the New Testament, <span class="lang el-gr">δουλεια</span> frequently denotes divine worship. Thus we read, in <span class="bvs">1Th_1:9</span>, “Ye turned to God from idols, <span class="lang el-gr">δουλευειν τω Θεω ζῶντι</span>,<em>to serve </em>the living God;” and in <span class="bvs">Gal_4:8</span>, it is said of the Galatians in their heathen state, that “<span class="lang el-gr">ἐδουλευσαν</span>, <em>they did service </em>unto them which, by nature, are no gods.” — See <em>Calvin </em>’<em>s Institutes</em>, Book I. chap.12, sections 2 and 3; <em>Turretine </em>’<em>s Works</em>, <em>volume </em>4, <em>De Necessaria Secessione Nostra ab Ecclesia Romana </em>, pp. 50-53; and <em>M </em>’<em>Gavin </em>’<em>s Protestant</em>, <em>volume </em>1, No. 42, p. 334. </p><p><strong>(251)</strong> The subject of the invocation of departed saints is discussed at length in Calvin’s Institutes, Book III. chap. 20, sections 21-27. </p></div>
