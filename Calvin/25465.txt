<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_12:5</span><strong>.</strong><em>Yea, I say to you, Fear Him </em>This is an emphatic, <span class="cite-ref">(596)</span> repetition of the statement. Christ must be viewed as saying, that when we give way to the dread of men, we pay no respect to God; and that if on the contrary we <em>fear </em>God, we have an easy victory in our hands, so that no efforts of men will draw us aside from our duty. The experience of every age shows the great necessity of this exhortation to the ministers of Christ, and likewise to all believers in general: for there never was a period when men did not rise furiously against God, and endeavor to overwhelm the Gospel. <span class="cite-ref">(597)</span> All are not armed indeed with equal power to hold out to believers the dread of death, but the greater number are animated by that savage ferocity, which discovers itself as soon as an opportunity occurs. Frequently, too, Satan brings forward giants, in whose presence the servants of Christ would fall down lifeless, were it not that this doctrine fortifies them to maintain unshaken perseverance. </p><p>The two clauses being very closely related to each other, it is an incorrect view which some unskilful persons take, by reading separately this clause, <em>Fear them not </em>For Christ, (as we have already said,) in order to cure that wicked <em>fear </em>of men, which draws us aside from the right path contrasts with it a devout and holy fear of God: otherwise the consequence would not follow that, if we fear God, who is the Lord of body and soul, we have no reason to fear men, whose power goes no farther than the body. With regard to the statement that men <em>have power to kill the body, </em>Christ made it by way of concession. God allows wicked men to enjoy such a degree of liberty, that they are swelled with confidence in their own power, imagine that they may attempt any thing, and even succeed in terrifying weak minds, as if they could do whatever they pleased. Now the proud imaginations of wicked men, as if the life of the godly were placed at their disposal, is utterly unfounded: for God keeps them within limits, and restrains, whenever it pleases him, the cruelty and violence of their attacks. And yet they are said to <em>have power to kill </em>by his permission, for he often permits them to indulge their cruel rage. Besides, our Lord’s discourse consists of two parts. First, in order to instruct us to bear with composure the loss of the bodily life, he bids us contemplate both eternal life and eternal death, and then arrives gradually at this point, that the protection of our life is in the hand of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(596)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Emporte poids</span>;” — “carries weight. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(597)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">S'esforcans d'abattre et exterminer l'Evangile</span>;” — “laboring to destroy and exterminate the Gospel.” </p></div></div>
