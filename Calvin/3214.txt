<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And he shall take a censer full. </em>Before he takes the blood into the sanctuary, (the priest) is commanded to offer incense. There was, as we have seen, an altar of incense, on which the priest burnt it, but without the veil; but now he is ordered to go within the veil, to make <span class="cite-ref">(246)</span> an incense-offering in the very holy of holies. But it is worth noticing, that is said that the cloud of the incense should cover the mercy-seat — that the priest die not; for by this sign it was shewn how formidable is God’s majesty, the sight of which is fatal even to the priest; that all might learn to tremble at it, and to prostrate themselves as suppliants before Him; and again, that all audacity and temerity might be repressed. But it is uncertain whether he killed together the bullock for himself and the goat for the people, or whether, after he had sprinkled the sanctuary with his own offering, he killed the goat separately. Moses indeed seems to mark this distinct order in the words he uses; for after having spoken of the first sprinkling, he immediately adds, “Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering:” but since the narrative of Moses is not always consecutive, and it is a matter of little importance, let the reader choose which he pleases. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(246)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour faire ce perfum exquis et solennel</span> :” to make the exquisite and solemn incense-offering. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
