It is word for word <em>with them; </em>but according to the phrase of the Hebrew tongue, it is all one as if it had been said, <em>in them, </em>or <em>by them, </em>or <em>towards them, </em>or simply <em>to them, </em>in the dative case. Therefore Luke doth not say <span class="lang el-gr">συν αυτοις</span><em>, </em>but <span class="lang el-gr">μετα αυτων</span>; which I say for this cause, lest any unskillful man ascribe some part of the praise to Paul and Barnabas, as if they had been partners with God in the work; whereas he doth rather make him the only author of all those famous facts which they had done.</p><p>Luke addeth immediately after, that the Lord had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles; for though they were sent unto the Gentiles, yet the strangeness [novelty] of the matter causeth them to wonder not a little; and not only the sudden change did make the Jews astonished, but also because it was to them as it were a monster, that unclean men, and such as were strangers<span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> from the kingdom of God, should be mixed with the holy seed of Abraham, that they might both together make one and ‘the same Church of God. They are now taught by the event itself, that it was not for nothing that there were apostles sent to them. Moreover, it is said that the door of faith was set open to the Gentiles, not only because the gospel was preached to them with the external voice, but because, being illuminated by the Spirit of God, they were called effectually unto the faith. The kingdom of heaven is indeed set open to us by the external preaching of the gospel; but no man entereth in save he to whom God reacheth out his hand; no man draweth near unless he be drawn inwardly by the Spirit. Therefore, Paul and Barnabas show and prove by the effect that their calling was approved and ratified by God, because the faith of the Gentiles was, as it were, a seal engraven by the hand of God to establish the same, as Paul saith, ( <span class="bvs">Rom_16:25</span>; <span class="bvs">2Co_3:7</span>.) </p><p><strong>(66)</strong></p><p>“ Amplum materiam,” ample materials. </p><p><strong>(67)</strong></p><p>“ Impuros et alienos,” impure men, aliens. </p></div>
