Yet, as if those blessings were presently in our possession, he states that we have received them; and illustrates the change which has taken place in our condition, when we were led from Adam to Christ. It is as if we had been brought from the deepest hell to heaven itself. And certainly, although, as respects ourselves, our salvation is still the object of hope, yet in Christ we already possess a blessed immortality and glory; and therefore, he adds, <em>in Christ Jesus</em>. Hitherto it does not appear in the members, but only in the head; yet, in consequence of the secret union, it belongs truly to the members. Some render it, <em>through Christ; </em>but, for the reason which has been mentioned, it is better to retain the usual rendering, <em>in Christ. </em>We are thus furnished with the richest consolation. Of everything which we now want, we have a sure pledge and foretaste in the person of Christ. </p></div>
