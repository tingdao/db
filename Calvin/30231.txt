<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>They that heard entreated, etc. </em>This is the second clause, in which he shows that the Law was very different from the Gospel; for when it was promulgated there was nothing but terrors on every side. For everything we read of in the nineteenth chapter of <span class="bvs">Exo_19:1</span> was of this kind, and intended to show to the people that God had ascended his tribunal and manifested himself as a strict judge. If by chance an innocent beast approached, he commanded it to be killed: how much heavier punishment awaited sinners who were conscious of their guilt, nay, who knew themselves to be condemned to eternal death by the Law? But the Gospel contains nothing but love, provided it be received by faith. What remains to be said you may read in the <span class="bvs">2Co_3:1</span> of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. </p><p>But by the words the people <em>entreated, </em>etc., is not to be understood that they refused to hear God, but that they prayed not to be constrained to hear God himself speaking; for by the interposition of Moses their dread was somewhat mitigated. <span class="cite-ref">(264)</span> Yet interpreters are at a loss to know how it is that the Apostle ascribes these words to Moses, <em>I exceedingly fear and quake; </em>for we read nowhere that they were expressed by Moses. But the difficulty may be easily removed, if we consider that Moses spoke thus in the name of the people, whose requests as their delegate he brought to God. It was, then, the common complaint of the whole people; but Moses is included, who was, as it were, the speaker for them all. <span class="cite-ref">(265)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(264)</span> The words at the end of verse 20, “or thrust through with a dart,” are not deemed genuine, being not found in the best MSS., and none of any authority containing them. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(265)</span> It is supposed by some that the reference here is to what is found in <span class="bvs">Exo_19:16</span>. It is said in the former verse that all the people in the camp trembled; and it is concluded that Moses was at the time with them, for it is said in the next verse that he brought them forth out of the camp. But the passage that seems most evidently to intimate what is here said in the <span class="bvs">Exo_19:19</span>, where we are told, that when the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder. “Moses spake” and that “God answered him by a voice.” Now we are not told what he said, nor what the answer was which God gave. It is however, natural to conclude, that under the circumstances mentioned, Moses expressed his fears, and that God removed them. —<em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
