Nevertheless, Joseph does not cease to fix the eyes of his mind on God; as it is written in the Prophet, </p><p>“I will wait upon the Lord that hideth his face <LineBreak />from the house of Jacob.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_8:17</span>.) </p><p>This passage also clearly teaches what was the design of this anxious choice of his sepulcher, namely, that it might be a seal of redemption: for after he has asserted that God was faithful, and would, in his own time, grant what he had promised, he immediately adjures his brethren to carry away his bones. These were useful relics, the sight of which plainly signified that, by the death of men, the eternal covenant in which Joseph commands his posterity safely to rest, had by no means become extinct; for he deems it sufficient to adduce the oath of God, to remove all their doubts respecting their deliverance. </p><p>End of the Commentaries on the first book of Moses called Genesis. </p></div>
