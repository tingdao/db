<div class="comment-content"><p>He pursues, as I have said, the same subject, and sharply inveighs against the sottishness of men, that they call on wood and stone, as though there were some hidden power in them. <em>They say to the wood, Awake</em>; for they implored help from their idols. <em>Shall it teach? </em>Some render it thus as a question; but I take it in a simpler form, “It will teach;” that is, “It is a wonder that ye are so wilfully foolish; for were God to send to you no Prophet, were there no one to instruct you, yet the wood and the stone would be sufficient teachers to you: ask your idols, that is, ascertain rightly what is in them. Doubtless, the god that is made of wood or of stone, sufficiently declares by his silence that he is no god. For there is no motion in wood and stone. Where there is no vigor and no life, is it not right to feel assured, that there is no deity? There are, indeed, many creatures endued with feeling and motion; but the God who gives power, and motion, and feeling to the whole world, and to all its parts, does he not surpass in these respects all his creatures? Since, then, wood and stone are silent, they are teachers sufficient for you, provided ye be apt scholars.” </p><p>We hence see how the Prophet in this way amplifies the insensibility of men; for they did not perceive what was quite manifest. The design of what follows is the same. <em>Behold, it is covered over with gold and silver</em>; that is, it is made splendid: for idolaters think that their gods are better when adorned with gold and silver; but yet <em>there is no breath in the midst of them</em>. “Look,” he says, “within; look within, and ye shall see that they are dead.” <span class="cite-ref">(47)</span> The rest we shall dilate on to-morrow. </p><p><strong>(47)</strong> With the exception of the clause, “It will teach,” there is a general agreement in the mode of rendering this verse. “Shall it teach,” is <em>Newcome’s </em>version. <em>Henderson </em>considers it to be ironical, “It teach!” <em>Grotius </em>agrees with <em>Calvin</em>, “It will itself teach thee,” that is, that it is deaf, and no god. I regard the verse as capable of a simpler and more literal rendering, as follows: </p><p>19.<em>Woe to him who saith to the wood, “Awake, Arise;” </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>To the dumb stone, “It will teach:” </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Behold, it is covered with gold and silver! </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Yet there is no breath within it. </em></p><p>The two verbs, “Awake, Arise,” stand connected with “wood,” and they are so given in the Septuagint; and there is a striking contrast between the dumb stone and teaching.—<em>Ed. </em></p></div>
