<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Thy hand shall find. </em>Hitherto the internal happiness of the kingdom has been described. Now there follows, as it was necessary there should, the celebration of its invincible strength against its enemies. What is said in this verse is of the same import as if the king had been pronounced victorious over all his enemies. I have just now remarked, that such a statement is not superfluous; for it would not have been enough for the kingdom to have flourished internally, and to have been replenished with peace, riches, and abundance of all good things, had it not also been well fortified against the attacks of foreign enemies. This particularly applies to the kingdom of Christ, which is never without enemies in this world. True, it is not always assailed by open war, and there is sometimes granted to it a period of respite; but the ministers of Satan never lay aside their malice and desire to do mischief, and therefore they never cease to plot and to endeavor to accomplish the overthrow of Christ’s kingdom. It is well for us that our King, who lifts up his hand as a shield before us to defend us, is stronger than all. As the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">מצא</span>, <em>matsa, </em>which is twice repeated, and which we have translated, <em>to find, </em>sometimes signifies <em>to suffice; </em>and, as in the first clause, there is prefixed to the word <span class="lang he-il">כל</span>, <em>kal, </em>which signifies <em>all, </em>the letter <span class="lang he-il">ל</span>, <em>lamed, </em>which signifies <em>for, </em>or <em>against, </em>and which is not prefixed to the Hebrew word which is rendered <em>those that hate thee; </em>some expositors, because of this diversity, explain the verse as if it had been said, Thy hand shall be able for all thine enemies, thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. Thus the sentence will ascend by degrees, — Thy hand shall be able to withstand, thy right hand shall lay hold upon thy enemies, so that they shall not escape destruction. </p></div>
