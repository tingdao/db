He afterwards adds, <em>That veil remaineth even until this day. </em>By this he means, that that dulness of vision was not for a single hour merely, but prefigured what the condition of the nation would be in time to come. â€œThat <em>veil </em>with which Moses covered his face, when publishing the law, was the emblem of a stupidity, that would come upon that people, and would continue upon them for a long period. Thus at this day, when the law is preached to them, in </p><p>hearing they hear not, and in seeing they see not.<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_13:13</span>.) </p><p>There is no reason, however, why we should be troubled, </p><p>as though some new thing had happened. (<span class="bvs">1Pe_4:12</span>.) </p><p>God has shown long ago under the type of the <em>veil, </em>that it would be so. Lest, however, any blame should attach to the law, he again repeats it, that <em>their hearts were covered with a veil </em></p><p><em>And it is not removed, because it is done away through Christ</em>. He assigns a reason, why they are so long in blindness in the midst of light. For the law is in itself bright, but it is only when Christ. appears to us in it, that we enjoy its splendor. The Jews turn away their eyes as much as they can from Christ. It is not therefore to be wondered, if they see nothing, refusing as they do to behold the sun. This blindness on the part of the chosen people, especially as it is so long continued, admonishes us not to be lifted up with pride, relying on the benefits that God has conferred upon us. This point is treated of in <span class="bvs">Rom_11:20</span>. Let, however, the reason of this blindness deter us from contempt of Christ, which God so grievously punishes. In the mean time, let us learn, that without Christ, the Sun of righteousness, (<span class="bvs">Mal_4:2</span>,) there is no light even in the law, or in the whole word of God. </p></div>
