<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Redeeming the time. </em>By a consideration of the time he enforces his exhortation.<em>The days are evil. </em>Everything around us tends to corrupt and mislead; so that it is difficult for godly persons, who walk among so many thorns, to escape unhurt. Such corruption having infected the age, the devil appears to have obtained tyrannical sway; so that <em>time </em>cannot be dedicated to God without being in some way <em>redeemed. </em>And what shall be the price of its redemption? To withdraw from the endless variety of allurements which would easily lead us astray; to rid ourselves from the cares and pleasures of the world; and, in a word, to abandon every hinderance. Let us be eager to recover it in every possible way, and let the numerous offenses and arduous toil, which many are in the habit of alleging as an apology for indolence, serve rather to awaken our vigilance. </p></div>
