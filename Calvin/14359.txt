<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>When I kept silence, my bones wasted away. </em>Here David confirms, by his own experience, the doctrine which he had laid down; namely, that when humbled under the hand of God, he felt that nothing was so miserable as to be deprived of his favor: by which he intimates, that this truth cannot be rightly understood until God has tried us with a feeling of his anger. Nor does he speak of a mere ordinary trial, but declares that he was entirely subdued with the extremest rigour. And certainly, the sluggishness of our flesh, in this matter, is no less wonderful than its hardihood. If we are not drawn by forcible means, we will never hasten to seek reconciliation to God so earnestly as we ought. In fine, the inspired writer teaches us by his own example, that we never perceive how great a happiness it is to enjoy the favor of God, until we have thoroughly felt from grievous conflicts with inward temptations, how terrible the anger of God is. He adds, that whether he was silent, or whether he attempted to heighten his grief by his crying and roaring, <span class="cite-ref">(661)</span> his bones waxed old; in other words, his whole strength withered away. From this it follows, that whithersoever the sinner may turn himself, or however he may be mentally affected, his malady is in no degree lightened, nor his welfare in any degree promoted, until he is restored to the favor of God. It often happens that those are tortured with the sharpest grief who gnaw the bit, and inwardly devour their sorrow, and keep it enclosed and shut up within, without discovering it, although afterwards they are seized as with sudden madness, and the force of their grief bursts forth with the greater impetus the longer it has been restrained. By the term <em>silence, </em>David means neither insensibility nor stupidity, but that feeling which lies between patience and obstinacy, and which is as much allied to the vice as to the virtue. For his bones were not consumed with age, but with the dreadful torments of his mind. His silence, however, was not the silence of hope or obedience, for it brought no alleviation of his misery. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(661)</span> The translation of this verse in our English Bible is, “When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long;” on which <em>Street </em>observes, “I must own I do not understand how a man can be said <em>to keep silence </em>who <em>roars </em>all the day long.” Accordingly, instead of <em>When I kept silence, </em>he reads, <em>While I am lost in thought; </em>observing that, the verb <span class="lang he-il">חרש</span>, in the Hiphil conjugation, signifies <em>to ponder, to consider, to be deep in thought.” </em>But according to the translation and exposition of Calvin, there is no inconsistency between the first and the second clause of the verse. To avoid the apparent contradiction of being at once <em>silent </em>and yet <em>roaring </em>all the day long, <em>Dr Boothroyd</em>, instead of <em>roaring, </em>reads <em>pangs. </em></p></div></div>
