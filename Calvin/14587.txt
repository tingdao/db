<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>My reproach is daily before me. </em>The Hebrew words <span class="lang he-il">כלהיום</span>, <em>col-hayom, </em>mean all the day, and denote long continuance: but they may be understood in two ways, either for the whole or entire day, from morning to evening, or for continued succession of days. According to either of these interpretations, the meaning is, that there is no end to their misfortunes. As to the change of the number from the plural to the singular, it is not at all inconsistent that what is spoken in the name of the Church should be uttered, as it were, in the person of one man. The reason is added why they were so overwhelmed with shame, that they dared not to lift up their eyes and their <em>face, </em>namely, because they had no respite, but were incessantly subjected to the insolence and reproach of their enemies. Had they been allowed to hide themselves in some corner, they might have endured, as well as they were able, their calamities in secret; but when their enemies openly derided them with the greatest insolence, it served to redouble the wound inflicted upon them. They, therefore, complain that their calamities had accumulated to such an extent, that they were forced unceasingly to hear blasphemies and bitter reproaches. They describe their enemies by the epithet <em>avengers, </em>a term which, among the Hebrews, denotes barbarity and cruelty, accompanied with pride, as we have remarked on the 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span> Psalm </p></div>
