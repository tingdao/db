<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Then the disciples went away again to their own homes. </em>It is possible that their minds were still in a state of doubt and uncertainty, when they returned home; for, though John says that <em>they believed, </em>yet their faith was not strong, but was only some confused remembrance of the miracle and resembled a trance, until it was more fully confirmed; and indeed, a strong faith could not be produced merely by the sight which they had beheld. Besides, Christ did not present himself to their view, until they had been more fully awakened from their carnal stupidity. They had indeed given a praise worthy demonstration of their zeal, in hastening to the sepulcher; yet Christ hid himself from them, because they sought him with too great superstition. </p></div>
