<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong>Understand by <em>unrighteousness, </em>the violation of justice among men, by not rendering to each his due. I have rendered <span class="lang el-gr">πονηρίαν</span>, according to the opinion of Ammonium, <em>wickedness; </em>for he teaches us that <span class="lang el-gr">πονηρον</span>, the wicked, is <span class="lang el-gr">δραστίκον κακου</span>, the doer of evil. The word (<em>nequitia </em>) then means practiced wickedness, or licentiousness in doing mischief: but maliciousness (<em>malitia </em>) is that depravity and obliquity of mind which leads us to do harm to our neighbour. <span class="cite-ref">(54)</span> For the word <span class="lang el-gr">πορνείαν</span>, which Paul uses, I have put lust, (<em>libidinem </em>.) I do not, however, object, if one prefers to render it fornication; but he means the inward passion as well as the outward act. <span class="cite-ref">(55)</span> The words <em>avarice</em>, <em>envy</em>, and <em>murder</em>, have nothing doubtful in their meaning. Under the word <em>strife</em>, (<em>contentione </em>,) <span class="cite-ref">(56)</span> he includes quarrels, fightings, and seditions. We have rendered <span class="lang el-gr">κακοηθείαν</span>, <em>perversity</em>, (<em>perversitatem </em>;) <span class="cite-ref">(57)</span> which is a notorious and uncommon wickedness; that is, when a man, covered over, as it were, with hardness, has become hardened in a corrupt course of life by custom and evil habit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(54)</span> The two words are<span class="lang el-gr">πονηρία </span> and κακία [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] renders them “mischief and malignity.” [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] says that<span class="lang el-gr">κακία </span> is vice, opposed to <span class="lang el-gr">τη αρετη </span> — virtue. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(55)</span><span class="lang el-gr">“Πορνεία </span> has an extended sense, comprehending <em>all illicit intercourse</em>, whether fornication, adultery, incest, or any other <em>venus illicita </em>.” — [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] </p><p><span class="cite-note">(56)</span> Improperly rendered “debate” in our version<span class="lang el-gr">— ἔριδος, </span> “strife”, by [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] <em>, </em>and “contention,” by [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>]. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(57)</span> In our versions “malignity;” by [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] <em>, </em>“bad disposition;” and by [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>], “inveteracy of evil habits.” [<span class="bvs">Schleusner </span>] thinks that it means here “malevolence.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
