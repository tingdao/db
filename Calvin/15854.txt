<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>Jehovah is gracious. </em>He comes now to point out the fruits of that love of which he spoke, setting before him God’s titles, in order that they might serve to preserve his faith in him. First, he denominates him <em>gracious, </em>because he is so ready graciously to render assistance. From this source springs that <em>justice </em>which he displays for the protection of his own people. To this is subjoined <em>mercy, </em>without which we would not deserve God’s aid. And as the afflictions which overtake us frequently appear to preclude the exercise of his justice, hence it follows that there is nothing better than to repose upon him alone; so that his fatherly kindness may engross our thoughts, and that no voluptuous pleasure may steal them away to any thing else. He then accommodates the experience of God’s benignity and equity to the preserving of the simple, that is, of such as, being undesigning, do not possess the requisite prudence for managing their own affairs. The term, rendered <em>simple, </em>is often understood in a bad sense, denoting persons inconsiderate and foolish, who will not follow wholesome advice. But, in this place, it is applied to those who are exposed to the abuse of the wicked, who are not sufficiently subtle and circumspect to elude the snares which are laid for them, — in short, to those who are easily overreached; while, on the contrary, the children of this world are full of ingenuity, and have every means at their command for maintaining and protecting themselves. David, therefore, acknowledges himself to be as a child, unable to consult his own safety, and totally unfit to ward off the dangers to which he was exposed. Hence the LXX. have not improperly translated the Hebrew term by the Greek, <span class="lang el-gr">τὰ νήπια</span>, <em>little children. </em><span class="cite-ref">(378)</span> The amount is, that when those who are liable to suffering have neither the prudence nor the means of effecting their deliverance, God manifests his wisdom towards them, and interposes the secret protection of his providence between them and all the dangers by which their safety may be assailed. In fine, David holds forth himself as a personal example of this fact, in that, after being reduced to the greatest straits, he had, by the grace of God, been restored to his former state. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(378)</span> This rendering of the LXX. also suggests the idea of <em>weakness, </em>which Fry has adopted, who reads, “Jehovah preserveth the weak.” “The usual meaning of <span class="lang he-il">פתאים</span>,” says he, “is <em>simplices, fatui, persuasu faciles </em>; but I believe the Septuagint has preserved the true meaning of the passage, <span class="lang el-gr">Φυλάσσων τὰ νήπια ὁ κυριος</span>. The leading idea of <span class="lang he-il">פתה</span> is <em>laxity </em>or <em>yielding, </em>and may as well apply to the weakness of the body, or of the faculties of the mind, under the pressure of grief and pain, as to the relaxing of the powers of the understanding, in yielding to the seductions of folly or vice.” </p></div></div>
