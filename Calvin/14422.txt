<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Violent witnesses </em><span class="cite-ref">(709)</span><em>rise up. </em>The Hebrew is, <em>they shall rise up; </em>but in using the future tense, the Psalmist intimates that he is speaking of what he had suffered for a long time. And he complains that he was so oppressed with calumny that he had no opportunity of defending himself; than which nothing more grievous and painful can ever happen to those of an ingenuous mind, and who are conscious of no blame. Besides, he not only says that he had been falsely accused, but he also condemns the audacity and insolence of those who violently rose up to bear witness against him. To this belongs what he adds, <em>They charge me with things which I know not. </em>David then was not only spoiled of his worldly goods, and basely driven into exile, but was also accused and loaded with infamy under color of justice. Being involved in such distress, he resorted directly to God, hoping that he would maintain his innocence. So ought the children of God to walk through good report and bad report, and patiently suffer reproach, until he assert and declare their innocence from on high. In old times, it was a common proverb among the heathen, “There is no theater more beautiful than a good conscience;” and in this they uttered a noble sentiment; but no man can be sustained and supported by the purity of his conscience unless he has recourse to God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(709)</span> “<span class="lang he-il">עדי חמס</span><em>witnesses of wrong or violence; </em>i.e., witnesses deponing to acts of violence, as committed by the person accused.
