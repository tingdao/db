<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_26:51</span><strong>.</strong><em>And, lo, one of those who were with Jesus. </em>Luke says, that all the disciples made an agreement together to fight for their Master. Hence it is again evident, that we are much more courageous and ready for fighting than for bearing the cross; and, therefore, we ought always to deliberate wisely what the Lord commands, and what he requires from every one of us, lest the fervor of our zeal exceed the bounds of reason and moderation. When the disciples asked Christ, <em>Shall we strike with the sword? </em>they did so, not with the intention of obeying his injunction; but by these words they declared that they were prepared and ready to repel the violence of enemies. And, indeed, Peter did not wait till he was commanded or permitted to strike, but inconsiderately proceeded to unlawful violence. It appears, at first view, to be praiseworthy valor in the disciples, that, forgetting their own weakness, though they are unable to make resistance, they do not hesitate to present their bodies before their Master, and to encounter certain death; for they choose rather to perish with the Lord than to survive and look on while he is oppressed. But as they improperly attempt more than the calling of God commands or permits, their rashness is justly condemned; and therefore let us learn, that in order that our obedience may be acceptable to the Lord, we must depend on his will, so that no man shall move a finger, except so far as God commands. One reason ought, above all, to lead us to be zealous in cultivating this modesty; which is, that instead of a proper and well-regulated zeal, confused irregularity for the most part reigns in us. </p><p>Peter’s name is not mentioned here by the Evangelists; but John (<span class="bvs">Joh_18:10</span>) assures us—and from what occurs shortly afterwards in the narrative it is evident — that it was Peter who is here described, though the name is suppressed. Yet Luke enables us easily to infer that there were others also who took part in the same outrage; for Christ does not speak to one person only, but says to all alike, <em>Permit </em><span class="cite-ref">(217)</span><em>it to be thus far. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(217)</span> Our Author’s argument is obviously founded on the circumstance, that the verb <span class="lang el-gr">ἐα̑τε</span>, <em>permit, </em>is in the plural number. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
