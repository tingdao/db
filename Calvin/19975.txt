<div class="comment-content"><p>But the Prophet immediately adds what the purpose was which they had all formed. They dwelt, he says, <em>in Geruth; </em>some render it, <em>“in </em>the peregrination;<em>” </em>but it seems to me to be a proper name, and I agree with those who so render it. <span class="cite-ref">(126)</span> But it is called the <em>Geruth of Chimham, </em>of whom mention is made in <span class="bvs">2Sa_19:31</span>. he was the son of Barzillai, who entertained David when a fugitive from his kingdom, and entertained him bountifully. When David wished to remunerate his kindness, the good man made his age as an excuse, and said, that he was old, so that he could not enjoy the things of this life; but he presented his son to David, and it is probable that this place was given to the son as a reward. It was hence called Geruth-Chimham, the name of its possessor being attached to it. And he says that it was <em>nigh Bethlehem. </em>It is also probable, that when David wished to remunerate his host, he chose a place nigh his own city, where he was born. </p><p>It is added, <em>to go, </em>etc. Then the Prophet shews that this was not a settled habitation, but that they intended to go into <em>Egypt </em>They knew that this was forbidden by the Law of God, and the Prophets had often pronounced a curse on such a design. Notwithstanding God’s prohibition, they prepared themselves for the journey. Fear was the cause; but how much so ever they might have justly feared, they ought yet to have considered what God permitted: for if a sick man takes poison instead of medicine, he must suffer the punishment that necessarily follows his own presumption and madness; so they who seek to provide for themselves contrary to God’s will, gain only their own destruction. This was done, as the Prophet tells us, by the remnant of the people. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(126)</span> It is given as a proper name in the <em>Sept.; </em>the idea of peregrination is given in the <em>Vulgate </em>and <em>Targum. </em>If it be a common noun, its proper meaning is not peregrination, but habitation or dwelling, or rather dwellings, it being in the plural number. <em>Blayney </em>takes it as a proper name. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
