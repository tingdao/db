<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Elijah indeed will come first. </em>We have stated elsewhere the origin of that error which prevailed among the Jews. As John the Baptist was to resemble <em>Elijah </em>by restoring the fallen condition of the Church, the prophet Malachi (<span class="bvs">Mal_4:5</span>) had even given to him the name of <em>Elijah; </em>and this had been rashly interpreted by the scribes, as if <em>Elijah the Tishbite </em>(<span class="bvs">1Kg_17:1</span>) were to return a second time to the world. Christ now declares that every thing which Malachi uttered was true, but that his prediction had been misunderstood and distorted from its true meaning. “The promise,” says he, “that <em>Eliah </em>would come was true, and has been already fulfilled; but the scribes have already rejected Elijah, whose name they idly and falsely plead in opposing me.” </p><p><em>And will restore all things. </em>This does not mean that <em>John the Baptist restored </em>them perfectly, but that he conveyed and handed them over to Christ, who would complete the work which he had begun. Now as the scribes had shamefully rejected John, Christ reminds his disciples that the impostures of such men ought not to give them uneasiness, and that it ought not to be reckoned strange, if, after having rejected the servant, they should, with equal disdain, reject his Master. And that no one might be distressed by a proceeding so strange, our Lord mentions that the Scripture contained predictions of both events, that the Redeemer of the world, and Elijah his forerunner, would be rejected by false and wicked teachers. </p></div>
