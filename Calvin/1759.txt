<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up. </em>The word, <span class="lang he-il">העמדתי</span>, <em>hagnemadthi, </em>is variously explained; it properly signifies “to appoint;” some, therefore, refer it to his eminent position, as if God had placed Pharaoh on the throne, for the purpose of better manifesting His glory. <span class="cite-ref">(109)</span> The Greek interpreter extends the meaning, translating it <span class="lang el-gr">ἐξήγειρά σε</span>, “I have stirred thee up, as much as to say, that Pharaoh had been chosen by the secret counsel and providence of God that His power might be exercised upon him; as He is constantly said to stir up those whom He brings forward, to apply them to those objects for which he has destined them. Others think that this sentence depends on what has gone before, and interpret it “I have preserved thee,” or “chosen that thou shouldest survive.” For the Hebrew verb, which is transitive in <em>Hiphil, </em>is derived from <span class="lang he-il">עמד</span>, <em>gnamod, </em>which means “to stand up.” Since, therefore, God had restrained Himself, He now assigns the cause of His moderation, because if Pharaoh had fallen in one trifling engagement, the glory of His victory would have been less illustrious. In fine, lest Pharaoh should flatter himself, or harden himself by vain confidence, God affirms that He does not want strength to destroy him immediately, but that He had delayed his ultimate punishment for another purpose, viz., that Pharaoh might slowly learn that he strove in vain against His incomparable power; and that thus this remarkable history should be celebrated in all ages. But although Paul follows the Greek interpreter, there is no reason why we should not embrace this latter sense; for we know that the Apostles were not so particular in quoting the words, but that they rather considered the substance. But, although we admit that by God’s long-suffering Pharaoh continued to hold out, until he became a clear and notorious proof of the madness and folly of all those who resist God, yet this also has reference to the eternal prescience of God; for therefore did God spare Pharaoh to stand for a time, because, before he was born, he had been predestinated for this purpose. Wherefore, also, Paul rightly concludes, that </p><p>“it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_9:16</span>.) </p><p>For whether God raises up or upholds the reprobate, He wonderfully manifests His glory by their perverseness. Thus is their ignorance refuted, who, by this cavil, endeavor to overturn the eternal predestination of God; because it is not said, that He created Pharaoh with this intention, but that he suspended His judgment for a. time. For this intermediate and progressive course of proceeding arose from this source, that Pharaoh was the organ or instrument of God’s wrath. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(109)</span><span class="lang he-il">העמדתיך</span>. By the Greek interpreter we should generally understand the LXX. to be meant, but it has <span class="lang el-gr">διετηρήθης</span>, which is obviously a less close rendering than <span class="lang el-gr">ἐξήγειρά σε</span>, the version adopted by Paul. As the root <span class="lang he-il">עמד</span>, means <em>to stand up, </em>it is perfectly regular that the Hiphil, or causal preterite, <em>I have made thee to stand up</em>, should be held equivalent to <em>I have raised thee up</em>, as in our A.V. <em>S. M., I have preserved thee. </em>— <em>W. </em></p><p>Calvin’s Latin is “excitavi te.” See Rev. J. Owen’s note on Calvin’s Commentary on <span class="bvs">Rom_9:17</span>. <em>Cal. Soc.
