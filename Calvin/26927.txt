<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Gathering them together, he commanded, etc </em>They had before done the duty of Apostles; but that lasted but a while; and, secondly, so far forth that they might with their preaching awake the Jews to hear their Master. And so that commandment to teach, which Christ had given them, (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:7</span>,) whilst he lived with them upon earth, was, as it were, a certain entrance into their apostleship which was to come, for which they were not yet ripe. Therefore, their ordinary function was not laid upon them, until such time as Christ was risen again; but they stirred up their nation (as I have said) like criers, that they might give ear to Christ. And then at length, after the resurrection, they were made Apostles, to publish abroad throughout the whole world that doctrine which was committed to them. And whereas after they were made Apostles, Christ commandeth them as yet to abstain from their office, that is done not without just cause; yea, many causes may be alleged why it should be so. That filthy forsaking of their Master was yet fresh; many notes and tokens of unbelief were yet fresh. Whereas, they had been so thoroughly taught, and had so suddenly forgotten all, they showed a manifest token of their great dullness of wit. Neither were they free from sluggishness, which could not otherwise fitly be purged, than by deferring the promised grace, that he might the more sharpen their desire. But this cause is chiefly to be noted, that the Lord did appoint a certain time for the sending of the Spirit, that the miracle might be the more apparent. Again, he suffered them to rest a while, that he might the better set forth the greatness of that business which he was about to commit unto them. And thereby is the truth of the gospel confirmed, because the Apostles were forbidden to address themselves to preach the same, until they should be well prepared in succession of time. </p><p>And they were commanded to stay together, because they should all have one spirit given them. If they had been dispersed, the unity should not have been so well known. Though they were scattered abroad afterwards in divers places, yet because they brought that which they had from one and the same fountain, it was all one, as if they always had had all one mouth. Furthermore, it was expedient that they should begin to preach the gospel at Jerusalem, that the prophecy might be fulfilled, </p><p>“There shall a law go out of Zion,<LineBreak />and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_2:3</span>.) </p><p>Although the participle <span class="lang el-gr">συναλιζομενος</span>, may be diversely translated, yet Erasmus his translation did please me best, because the signification of <em>gathering together </em>will agree better with the text, [context.] </p><p><em>They should wait for the promise </em>It was meet that these should be accustomed to obey first, who should shortly after lay Christ’s yoke upon the neck of the world. And surely they have taught us by their example, that we must work and rest at the Lord’s pleasure alone. For if, during our life, we go on warfare under his banner and conduct, surely he ought to have no less authority over us than any earthly captain hath in his army. Therefore, as warlike discipline requireth this, that no man wage unless he be commanded by the captain, so it is not lawful for us either to go out, or to attempt any thing, until the Lord give the watchword; and so soon as he bloweth the retreat, we must stay, [halt.] Moreover, we are taught that we are made partakers of the gifts of God through hope. But we must mark the nature of hope as it is described in this place. For that is not hope which every man feigneth to himself unadvisedly, but that which is grounded on the promise of God. Therefore Christ cloth not suffer his apostles to look for whatsoever they will, but he addeth expressly the promise of the Father. Furthermore, he maketh himself a witness thereof; because we ought to be so sure and certain, that although all the engines of hell gainstand us, yet this may remain surely fixed in our minds, that we have believed God. I know, saith Paul, whom I have believed, (<span class="bvs">Tit_1:12</span>.) And here he putteth them in mind of those things which are written in <span class="bvs">Joh_14:15</span>, </p><p>“I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may continue with you; I say the Spirit of truth,” etc. </p><p>Again, </p><p>“I have spoken these things unto you while I am with you.” “And the Spirit, whom my Father shall send in my name, shall teach you all things,” (<span class="bvs">Joh_14:25</span>,) etc. </p><p>And again, </p><p>“When the Spirit of truth shall come, whom I will send from my Father, he shall bear witness of me,” (<span class="bvs">Joh_15:26</span>.) </p><p>And again, </p><p>“If I shall go hence, I will send you the Comforter, who shall reprove the world,” (<span class="bvs">Joh_16:7</span>.) </p><p>And he had said long before, </p><p>“He which believeth in me, out of his belly<LineBreak />shall flow rivers of living water,”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_7:38</span>.) </p></div>
