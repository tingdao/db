<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Even the man of my peace. </em>As the very height of all his miseries, David here declares that he had found the same treachery in some one, or, indeed, in many of his greatest friends. For the change of number is very frequent in the Hebrew language, so that he may speak of several individuals as if they were only one person. Thus the meaning would be: Not only the common people, or strangers of whom I had no knowledge or acquaintance, but my greatest friends, nay, even those with whom I was most intimate, and those of my own household, whom I admitted to eat and drink with me at my table, vaunt themselves reproachfully against me. Among the Hebrews, the expression, <em>men of peace, </em>denotes their kinsfolk and connections; but it was a much closer alliance, and one which ought to have secured a stricter observance of the laws of friendship, <em>to eat the bread </em>of David in company with himself: for it is as if he had employed the appellation, My companion. <span class="cite-ref">(107)</span> If, however, any would rather understand it of some particular traitor than of several persons, I have no objection to it. <em>To lift up the heel </em>is, in my opinion, to be understood metaphorically, and signifies <em>to rise up disdainfully </em>against a man who is afflicted and cast down. <span class="cite-ref">(108)</span> Others explain the expression by <em>to lay wait secretly; </em>but the former interpretation is more appropriate, That the wicked, seeing that David was placed in embarrassed circumstances, or already prostrated in the dust, took occasion from this to assail him indirectly indeed, but, nevertheless, always with insolence; a thing which usually happens among people of a wicked and servile disposition. Christ, in quoting this passage, (<span class="bvs">Joh_13:18</span>,) applies it to the person of Judas. And certainly we ought to understand that, although David speaks of himself in this psalm, yet he speaks not as a common and private person, but as one who represented the person of Christ, inasmuch as he was, as it were, the example after which the whole Church should be conformed — a point well entitled to our attention, in order that each of us may prepare himself for the same condition. It was necessary that what was begun in David should be fully accomplished in Christ; and, therefore, it must of necessity come to pass, that the same thing should be fulfilled in each of his members, namely, that they should not only suffer from external violence and force, but also from internal foes, ever ready to betray them, even as Paul declares that the Church shall be assailed, not only by <em>“fightings </em>without,” but also by <em>“fears </em>within,” (<span class="bvs">2Co_7:5</span>.) </p><p><strong>(107)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mon compagnon ordinaire, et qui estoit a pot et a feu avec moy, ainsi qu’on dit en commun proverbe</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “My usual companion, and one who, according to the common proverb, had bed and board with me.” </p><p><strong>(108)</strong> “<em>Hath lifted against me his heel</em>; <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. hath spurned me, hath kicked at me, as a vicious beast of burden does, hath insulted me in my misery.
