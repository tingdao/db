<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Behold, those from afar shall come. </em>The opinion entertained by some, that the four quarters of the earth are here denoted, does not rest on very solid grounds; yet I do not reject it, because it not only is probable, but agrees with many other passages. Undoubtedly, he first says that they shall come from distant parts of the world, and next adds certain subdivisions or parts in order to explain this general statement. </p><p><em>And those from the land of Sinis. </em>Instead of “Sinis,” some read “Sinis;” and indeed the Hebrew copies differ. <span class="cite-ref">(5)</span> Jerome thinks (and this is the commonly received opinion) that a southern region is so denominated from Mount Sinai, which lay toward the south. Others think that “Syene” is meant, because it lies under the tropic of Cancer. <span class="cite-ref">(6)</span> But this diversity has nothing to do with the meaning of the Prophet, which of itself is clear and easy to be understood; for the Prophet unquestionably means those who had been scattered and dispersed in various places, whether they are collected from the north or from the sea. While Isaiah promises a return from Babylon, he at the same time extends this prediction to the time of Christ, as may be easily learned from what goes before; for we must keep in remembrance what we formerly said, that the second birth of the Church is here described. Not only does he promise that the Jews shall return to Jerusalem to build the temple, but likewise that they who had formerly been aliens from the Church, shall be collected from every corner of the world. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(5)</span> The resemblance of <span class="lang he-il">ס</span><em>Samech </em>to <span class="lang he-il">ם</span> final <em>Mem </em>partly accounts for the difference of the readings. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(6)</span> “Various interpretations have been given of this name, both in ancient and modern times. The Targum and Vulgate understand it of some land in the far south; the Septuagint supposes it to be Persia; Jerome, Jarchi, and Grotius, misled by similarity of sound, refer it to the wilderness of Sin and Mount Sinai. Others refer it to Egypt, as if that country were so named, either from Sin, or Syene.
