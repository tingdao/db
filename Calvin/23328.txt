<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Your Father will give good things </em>This is expressly mentioned by Christ, that believers may not give way to foolish and improper desires in prayer. We know how great influence, in this respect, is exerted by the excesses and presumption of our flesh. There is nothing which we do not allow ourselves to ask from God; and if he does not humor our folly, we exclaim against him. Christ therefore enjoins us to submit our desires to the will of God, that he may give us nothing more than he knows to be advantageous. We must not think that he takes no notice of us, when he does not answer our wishes: for he has a right to distinguish what we actually need. All our affections being blind, the rule of prayer must be sought from the word of God: for we are not competent judges of so weighty a matter. He who desires to approach God with the conviction that he will be heard, must learn to restrain his heart from asking any thing that is not agreeable to his will. </p><p>“Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Jas_4:3</span>) ] </p><p>Instead of <em>good things ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἀγαθὰ</span><em>) </em>in the last clause, Luke says <em>the Holy Spirit </em>This does not exclude other benefits, but points out what we ought chiefly to ask: for we ought never to forget the exhortation, <em>Seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all other things shall be added to you, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_6:33</span>.) It is the duty of the children of God, when they engage in prayer, to strip themselves of earthly affections, and to rise to meditation on the spiritual life. In this way, they will set little value on food and clothing, as compared to the earnest and pledge of their adoption, (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Eph_1:14</span> :) and when God has given so valuable a treasure, he will not refuse smaller favors. </p></div>
