<div class="comment-content"><p>The accumulation of terms which occurs in the next verse, in which he lays a restraint as with a bridle upon anger, allays wrath and assuages passion, it is not superfluous; but, as in necessary, he rather prescribes numerous remedies for a disease which it is difficult to cure. By this means, he reminds us how easily we are provoked, and how ready we are to take offence, unless we lay a powerful restraint upon our tumultuous passions, and keep them under control. And although the faithful are not able to subdue the lusts of the flesh without much trouble and labour, whilst the prosperity of the wicked excites their impatience, yet this repetition teaches us that we ought unceasingly to wrestle against them; for if we steadily persevere, we know that our endeavors shall not be in vain in the end. I differ from other commentators in the exposition of the last clause. They translate it, <em>at least to do evil; </em>as if David meant that we should appease our anger lest it should lead us to do mischief. But as the particle <span class="lang he-il">אך</span>, <em>ach, </em>which they translate <em>at least, </em>is often used affirmatively in Hebrew, I have no doubt that David here teaches, that it cannot be otherwise than that the offense which we take at the prosperity of the wicked should lead us to sin, unless we speedily check it; as it is said in another Psalm, </p><p>“God will break the cords of the ungodly, lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_125:3</span>.) </p></div>
