<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>And thou shalt make a vail. </em>The inner shrine or recess was covered by one vail; the sanctuary was divided from the court by another. By both the people were admonished how reverently God’s majesty must be regarded, and with what seriousness holy things are to be engaged in, so that they might not approach God’s presence without fear, nor boldly break in upon the mysteries of things sacred. But by the vail the obscurity of the shadows of the Law was principally denoted, that the Israelites might know that the time of full revelation had not yet come, but that the spiritual worship of God was as yet enshrouded in a vail; and thus might extend their faith to their promised Messiah, at whose coming the truth would be discovered and laid bare. Wherefore, when Christ rose again from the dead, “the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,” (<span class="bvs">Mat_27:51</span>;) and an end was put to the ceremonies of the Law, because God then presented Himself in His living and express image, and the perfect reality of all the ceremonies was manifested. Now, therefore, in the light of the gospel, we behold “face to face,” what was then shewn afar off to the ancient people under coverings. (<span class="bvs">2Co_3:14</span>.) Yet, although there is now no vail to prevent us from openly and familiarly looking upon Christ, let us learn from this figure that the manifestation of God in the flesh is a hidden and incomprehensible mystery. (<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:16</span>.) It is not without reason that Christ Himself compares His body to the temple, because the fullness of the Godhead dwells in it. (<span class="bvs">Joh_2:19</span>.) Let us then know assuredly that the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father, (<span class="bvs">Joh_17:21</span>;) but if it be asked in what manner, this is ineffable, except that the eternal Son of God, who, before the creation of the world, possessed the same glory with the Father, (<span class="bvs">Joh_17:5</span>,) that even He is now man, that “He might be the firstborn among many brethren.” (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:29</span>.) </p></div>
