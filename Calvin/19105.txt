<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah turns now his discourse to the whole people. In the last verse he reproved only the priests and the prophets; he now speaks more generally, and says, that they had put off all shame. “Behold,” he says, “they are sufficiently proved guilty, their wickedness is manifest, and yet there is no shame. Their disgrace is visible to heaven and earth; angels and all mortals are witnesses of their corruption; but they have such a meretricious front that they are touched by no sense of shame.” He means, in these words, that the wickedness of the people was past all remedy; for they had arrived to that degree of stupor, of which Paul speaks, when he calls those <span class="lang el-gr">ἀπηλγηκότας</span>, who were obstinate in their vices, who saw no difference between right and wrong, between white and black. (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:19</span>.) </p><p>This, then, is what the Prophet means when he says, <em>Have they been ashamed? </em>But a question is much more emphatical, than if it was a simple reprobation or affirmation. They have not been even ashamed, he says. In their very shame, they knew not what it was to be touched by any shamefacedness. This may be classed with those reproofs, by which they had not been subdued; as though he had said, “Efforts having been made to expose their effrontery, in not humbling themselves under the hand of God; they <em>shall therefore fall among the fallen;” </em>that is, “I will dispute no longer with them, nor contend in words, but will execute on them my judgment.” <em>Fall, </em>then, <em>shall they among the fallen; </em>as though he had said, “I have more than sufficiently denounced war on them: had they been healable it would have availed to their conversion, that they had been so often warned; and still more, that I have so sharply stimulated them to come to me: but I will now no more employ words, on the contrary, I will execute my vengeance, so that the calamity which they have derived may devour them.” <span class="cite-ref">(176)</span></p><p><em>They shall wholly fall, </em>he says, <em>in the day of their visitation </em>From this second clause we understand more clearly what it is or what he means when he speaks of falling among the fallen, which is, that they should wholly fall, when God would come as it were with a drawn sword to destroy them, having been wearied with giving them so many warnings. </p><p><strong>(176)</strong> The <em>Syriac </em>is the only version that puts the first verb in an interrogatory form. “They have been confounded,“ is the <em>Septuagint </em>and <em>Vulgate; </em>and similar is the rendering of the <em>Arabic </em>and the <em>Targum</em>. The verb, taken literally, it being in Huphal, may be rendered, “They have been put to shame,“ or have been made to be ashamed; that is, they had been exposed to shame; but this shame they felt not, according to what follows. Their previous evils were enough to make them feel ashamed; but they had not that effect: hence entire ruin is denounced on them at the end of the verse. The rendering of the whole is as follows, — </p><p><strong>15.</strong>Exposed to shame have they been, Because abomination have they wrought: Neither with shame are they ashamed, Nor how to be abashed do they know; Therefore fall shall they with the fallen; At the time when I shall visit them, They shall perish, saith Jehovah. </p><p>There is no necessity to make this verse and the 12th of chap. 8 (<span class="bvs">Jer_8:12</span>) the same in every particular, as <em>Blayney </em>attempts to do. Both passages are the same in meaning, with a little variety in some of the words. The particle <span class="lang he-il">גם</span>, repeated, may be rendered by<em>, either </em>and <em>nor. </em>See <span class="bvs">Num_23:5</span>. The verb <span class="lang he-il">הכלים</span> is an infinitive Huphal. It is rendered as an infinitive by the <em>Vulgate. “ </em>They shall perish,“ which is according to the <em>Septuagint, </em>the <em>Syriac, </em>and the <em>Arabic, </em>is literally, “They shall be made to stumble.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
