<div class="comment-content"><p>As to the second clause, in which he triumphs over death and the grave, it is not certain whether he speaks of himself, or whether he meant there also to quote the words of the Prophet. For where we render it, “I will be thy destruction, O death! — thy ruin, O grave<em>!” </em>the Greeks have translated it, “<em>Where, O death, is thy suit? </em><span class="cite-ref">(143)</span><em>where, O grave, thy sting?” </em>Now although this mistake of the Greeks is excusable from the near resemblance of the words, <span class="cite-ref">(144)</span> yet if any one will attentively examine the context, he will see that they have gone quite away from the Prophet’s intention. The true meaning, then, will be this — that the Lord will put an end to death, and destroy the grave. It is possible, however, that, as the Greek translation was in common use, Paul alluded to it, and in that there is nothing inconsistent, though he has not quoted literally, for instead of <em>victory </em>he has used the term <em>action, </em>or <em>law-suit. </em><span class="cite-ref">(145)</span> I am certainly of opinion, that the Apostle did not deliberately intend to call in the Prophet as a witness, with the view of making a wrong use of his authority, but simply accommodated, in passing, to his own use a sentiment that had come into common use, as being, independently of this, of a pious nature. <span class="cite-ref">(146)</span> The main thing is this — that Paul, by an exclamation of a spirited nature, designed to rouse up the minds of the Corinthians, and lead them on, as it were, to a near view of the resurrection. Now, although we do not as yet behold the victory with our eyes, and the day of triumph has not yet arrived, (nay more, the dangers of war must every day be encountered,) yet the assurance of faith, as we shall have occasion to observe ere long, is not at all thereby diminished. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(143)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ou est ton plaid, c’est a dire, le proces que tu intentes contre nons, o mort</span> ?” — “O death, where is thy suit — that is to say, the process that thou carriest on against us?” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(144)</span> “The passage (says Dr. Bloomfield) is from <span class="bvs">Hos_13:14</span>, and the Apostle’s words differ only by the transposition of <span class="lang el-gr">νῖκος</span><em>(victory) </em>and <span class="lang el-gr">κέντρον</span>, <em>(sting,) </em>from the ancient versions; except that for <span class="lang el-gr">νῖκος</span> the Sept. has <span class="lang el-gr">δίκν</span><em>(law-suit.)” </em>It is noticed, however, by <em>Granville Penn, </em>that “in the <em>most ancient </em>of all the existing MSS. (Vat. and <em>Ephr.) </em>there is no <em>transposition </em>of <span class="lang el-gr">θανατος</span><em>(death) </em>and <span class="lang el-gr">κεντρον</span>, <em>(sting;) </em>and the Apostle’s sentence preserves the same order as in the Greek of Hosea; so that the transposition lies wholly at the door of those MSS. which are <em>more recent than those ancient copies.” </em>The <em>Vat. </em>version has <span class="lang el-gr">νεικος</span>; instead of <span class="lang el-gr">νικος</span>, but from the circumstance that in that version <span class="lang el-gr">νεικος</span> is used in the 54<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse manifestly instead of <span class="lang el-gr">νικος</span><em>, </em>it abundantly appears that it is a mere difference of spelling. The words to which Calvin refers, as having been mistaken for each other from their <em>near resemblance, </em>are, <span class="lang el-gr">δικη</span><em>(law-suit) </em>and <span class="lang el-gr">νικος</span>, (or <span class="lang el-gr">νικη</span>,<em>) victory. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(145)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car en lieu du mot </span><span class="lang el-gr">δίκη</span><span class="lang fr-fr"></span><em class="lang fr-fr">, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">qui signifie </span><em class="lang fr-fr">plaid </em><span class="lang fr-fr">ou </span><em class="lang fr-fr">proces, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">il a mis </span><span class="lang el-gr">νῖκος</span><span class="lang fr-fr"></span><em class="lang fr-fr">, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">qui signifie </span><em class="lang fr-fr">victoire </em><em>; </em>” — “For in place of the word <span class="lang el-gr">δίκη</span>, which signifies an <em>action </em>or <em>law-suit, </em>they have used <span class="lang el-gr">νῖκος</span>, which signifies <em>victory.” </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(146)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Bonne et saincte</span>;” — “Good and holy,” </p></div></div>
