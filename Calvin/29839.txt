<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>If we deny him, he will also deny us </em>A threatening is likewise added, for the purpose of shaking off sloth; for he threatens that they who, through the dread of persecution, leave off the confession of his name, have no part or lot with Christ. How unreasonable is it, that we should esteem more highly the transitory life of this world than the holy and sacred name of the Son of God! And why should he reckon among his people those who treacherously reject him? Here the excuse of weakness is of no value; <span class="cite-ref">(169)</span> for, if men did not willingly deceive themselves with vain flatteries, they would constantly resist, being endued with the spirit of strength and courage. Their base denial of Christ proceeds not only from weakness, but from unbelief; because it is in consequence of being blinded by the allurement of the world, that they do not at all perceive the life which is in the kingdom of God. But this doctrine has more need of being meditated on than of being explained; for the words of Christ are perfectly clear, </p><p>“Whoever shall deny me, him will I also deny” (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:33</span>.) </p><p>It remains that every one consider with himself, that this is no childish terror, but the judge seriously pronounces what will be found, at the appointed time, to be true. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(169)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">On ne gaigne rien yci de se defendre et excuser, en alleguant son infirmite</span>.” — “Here nothing is gained by defending and excusing ourselves on the ground of our weakness.” </p></div></div>
