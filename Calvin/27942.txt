<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong>Being not satisfied with this modest statement, he qualifies it, and shows, that he did not so occupy the place of a teacher, but that he wished to learn also from them; as though he said, “I desire so to confirm you according to the measure of grace conferred on me, that your example may also add courage (<em>alacritatem </em> — alacrity) to my faith, and that we may thus mutually benefit one another.” </p><p>See to what degree of modesty his pious heart submitted itself, so that he disdained not to seek confirmation from unexperienced beginners: nor did he speak dissemblingly, for there is no one so void of gifts in the Church of Christ, who is not able to contribute something to our benefit: but we are hindered by our envy and by our pride from gathering such fruit from one another. Such is our high-mindedness, such is the inebriety produced by vain reputation, that despising and disregarding others, every one thinks that he possesses what is abundantly sufficient for himself. I prefer to read with Bucer, <em>exhortation </em>(<em>exhortationem </em> — encouragement) rather than <em>consolatim </em>; for it agrees better with the former part. <span class="cite-ref">(35)</span></p><p><strong>(35)</strong> The verb is<span class="lang el-gr">συμπαρακληθὢναι, </span> which [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] connects with<span class="lang el-gr">επιποθῶ </span> in the preceding verse; and adds, “He softens what he had said, by showing, that he would not only bring some joy to them, but they also to him.” “Ut percipiam consolationem — that I may receive consolation,” [<span class="bvs">Piscator </span>] <em>; </em>— “Ut unà recreemur — that we may be together refreshed,” [<span class="bvs">Castelio </span>]. “Ad communem exhortationem percipiendam — in order to receive common exhortation,” [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>]; “Ut gaudium et voluptatem ex vobis precipiam — that I may receive joy and pleasure from you;” vel, “Ut mutuo solatio invicem nos erigamus atque firmemus — that by mutual comfort we may console and strengthen one another,” [<span class="bvs">Schleusner </span>] </p><p>The verb with the prefix<span class="lang el-gr">, συμ, </span> is only found here; but the verb<span class="lang el-gr">παρακαλέω </span> frequently occurs, and its common meaning is, to beseech, to exhort to encourage, and by these means to comfort. </p><p>With regard to this passage, Professor [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] says, “I have rendered the word, <em>comfort</em>, only because I cannot find any English word which will convey the full sense of the original.” </p><p>“The word rendered <em>to comfort</em>, ” says Professor [<span class="bvs">Hodge </span>], “means <em>to invite</em>, <em>to exhort</em>, <em>to instruct</em>, <em>to console</em>, etc. Which of these senses is to be preferred here, it is not easy to decide. Most probably the Apostle intended to use the word in a wide sense, as expressing the idea, that he might be excited, encouraged, and comforted by his intercourse with his Christian brethren.” — The two verses may be thus rendered: — </p><p><strong>11.</strong>For I desire much to see you, that I may impart to you spiritual </p><p><strong>12.</strong>benefit, so that you may be strengthened: this also is what <em>I desire</em>, to be encouraged together with you, through the faith which is in both, even in you and in me. </p><p>[<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] observes<span class="lang el-gr">, “ἐν ἀλλήλοις </span>impropriè dixit pro <em>in utrisque</em>, in me et vobis.
