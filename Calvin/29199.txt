<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Ye see</em>. The meaning of the Greek verb<span class="lang el-gr">ἴδετε, </span> is so far doubtful that it may be taken either in the imperative or indicative mood; but the force of the passage is little if at all affected. To convince the Galatians more fully of his anxiety about them, and at the same time to ensure their careful perusal, he mentions that this long Epistle had been written with his own hand. The greater the toil to which he had submitted on their account, the stronger were their inducements to read it, not in a superficial manner, but with the closest attention. </p></div>
