<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>On this account the Father loveth me. </em>There is, indeed, another and a higher reason why <em>the Father loveth the Son</em>; for it was not in vain that a voice was heard from heaven, </p><p>This is my beloved Son, in whom the good-pleasure of God dwells, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_3:17</span>.) </p><p>But as he was made man on our account, and as the Father delighted in him, in order that he might reconcile us to himself, we need not wonder if he declares it to be the reason why<em>the Father loveth him</em>, that our salvation is dearer to him than his own life. This is a wonderful commendation of the goodness of God to us, and ought justly to arouse our whole souls into rapturous admiration, that not only does God extend to us the love which is due to the only-begotten Son, but he refers it to us as the final cause. And indeed there was no necessity that Christ should take upon him our flesh, in which he was <em>beloved</em>, but that it might be the pledge of the mercy of <em>his Father </em>in redeeming us. </p><p><em>That I may take it again. As </em>the disciples might be deeply grieved on account of what they had heard about the death of Christ, and as their faith might even be greatly shaken, he comforts them by the hope of his resurrection, which would speedily take place; as if he said, that he would not die on the condition of being swallowed up by death, but in order that he might soon rise again as a conqueror. And even at the present day, we ought to contemplate the death of Christ, so as to remember, at the same time, the glory of his resurrection. Thus, we know that he is <em>life</em>, because, in his contest with death, he obtained a splendid victory, and achieved a noble triumph. </p></div>
