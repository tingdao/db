<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>If God be glorified. </em>Christ concludes that he will obtain a <em>glorious </em>triumph by his death; because his sole design in it is, to <em>glorify </em>his Father; for the Father did not seek his <em>glory </em>from the death of his Son in such a manner as not to make the Son a partaker of that <em>glory</em>. He promises, therefore, that when the ignominy which he shall endure for a short time has been effaced, illustrious honor will be displayed in his death. And this too was accomplished; for the death of the cross, which Christ suffered, is so far from obscuring his high rank, that in that death his high rank is chiefly displayed, since there his amazing love to mankind, his infinite righteousness in atoning for sin and appeasing the wrath of God, his wonderful power in conquering death, subduing Satan, and, at length, opening heaven, blazed with full brightness. This doctrine is now extended also to all of us; for though the whole world should conspire to cover us with infamy, yet if we sincerely and honestly endeavor to promote the glory of God, we ought not to doubt that God will also glorify us. </p><p><em>And will immediately glorify him. </em>Christ heightens the consolation by arguments drawn from the shortness of the time, when he promises that it will take place <em>immediately</em>. And though this glory began at the day of his resurrection, yet what is chiefly described here is the extension of it, which followed <em>immediately </em>afterwards, when, raising the dead by the power of the Gospel and of his Spirit, he created a new people for himself; for the honor which peculiarly belongs to the death of Christ, is the fruit which sprung from it for the salvation of men. </p></div>
