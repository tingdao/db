<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Of righteousness. </em>We must attend to the succession of steps which Christ lays down. He now says that <em>the world </em>must be <em>convinced of righteousness</em>; for men will never hunger and thirst for <em>righteousness</em>, but, on the contrary, will disdainfully reject all that is said concerning it, if they have not been moved by a conviction <em>of sin </em>As to believers particularly, we ought to understand that they cannot make progress in the Gospel till they have first been humbled; and this cannot take place, till they have acknowledged their sins. It is undoubtedly the peculiar office of the Law to summon consciences to the judgment-seat of God, and to strike them with terror; but the Gospel cannot be preached in a proper manner, till it lead men from <em>sin </em>to <em>righteousness</em>, and from death to life; and, therefore, it is necessary to borrow from the Law that first clause of which Christ spoke. </p><p>By <em>righteousness </em>must here be understood that which is imparted to us through the grace of Christ. Christ makes it to consist in his ascension to the Father, and not without good reason; for, as Paul declares that he <em>rose for our justification</em>, (<span class="bvs">Rom_4:25</span>) so he now sits at the right hand of the Father in such a manner as to exercise all the authority that has been given to him, and thus to <em>fill all things</em>, (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:10</span>.) In short, from the heavenly glory he fills the world with the sweet savor of his <em>righteousness </em>Now <em>the Spirit </em>declares, by the Gospel, that this is the only way in which we are accounted <em>righteous </em>Next to the conviction of <em>sin</em>, this is the second step, that <em>the Spirit </em>should <em>convince the world </em>what true <em>righteousness </em>is, namely, that Christ, by his ascension to heaven, has established the kingdom of life, and now sits at the right hand of the Father, to confirm true <em>righteousness </em></p></div>
