<div class="comment-content"><p>When we are told that the law has no influence in obtaining justification, various suggestions immediately arise, that it must be either useless, or opposed to God’s covenant, or something of that sort. Nay, it might occur, why should we not say of the law, what Jeremiah says of the New Testament, (<span class="bvs">Jer_31:31</span>,) that it was given at a later period, in order to supply the weakness of the former doctrine? Objections of this kind must be answered, if Paul wished to satisfy the Galatians. First, then, he inquires, — what is the use of the law? Having come after the promise, it appears to have been intended to supply its defects; and there was room at least for doubting, whether the promise would have been effectual, if it had not been aided by the law. Let it be observed, that Paul does not speak of the moral law only, but of everything connected with the office held by Moses. That office, which was peculiar to Moses, consisted in laying down a rule of life and ceremonies to be observed in the worship of God, and in afterwards adding promises and threatenings. Many promises, no doubt, relating to the free mercy of God and to Christ, are to be found in his writings; and these promises belong to faith. But this must be viewed as accidental, and altogether foreign to the inquiry, so far as a comparison is made between the law and the doctrine of grace. Let it be remembered, that the amount of the question is this: When a promise had been made, why did Moses afterwards add that new condition, “If a man do, he shall live in them;” and, “Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them?” (<span class="bvs">Lev_18:5</span>; <span class="bvs">Deu_27:26</span>.) Was it to produce something better and more perfect? </p><p>19. <em>Because of transgressions</em>. The law has manifold uses, but Paul confines himself to that which bears on his present subject. He did not propose to inquire in how many ways the law is of advantage to men. It is necessary to put readers on their guard on this point; for very many, I find, have fallen into the mistake of acknowledging no other advantage belonging to the law, but what is expressed in this passage. Paul himself elsewhere speaks of the precepts of the law as profitable for doctrine and exhortations. (<span class="bvs">2Ti_3:16</span>.) The definition here given of the use of the law is not complete, and those who refuse to make any other acknowledgment in favor of the law do wrong. Now, what is the import of the phrase, <em>because of transgressions </em>? It agrees with the saying of philosophers, that “The law was made for restraining evil-doers,” and with the old proverb, “From bad manners have sprung good laws.” But Paul’s meaning is more extensive than the words may seem to convey. He means that the law was published in order to make known transgressions, and in this way to compel men to acknowledge their guilt. As men naturally are too ready to excuse themselves, so, until they are roused by the law, their consciences are asleep. </p><p>“Until the law,” says Paul, “sin was in the world:<LineBreak />but sin is not imputed where there is no law.” (<span class="bvs">Rom_5:13</span>.) </p><p>The law came and roused the sleepers, for this is the true preparation for Christ. “By the law is the knowledge of sin.” (<span class="bvs">Rom_3:20</span>.) Why? </p><p>“That Sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.” (<span class="bvs">Rom_7:13</span>.) </p><p>Thus, “the law was added because of transgressions,” in order to reveal their true character, or, as he tells the Romans, that it might make them to abound. (<span class="bvs">Rom_5:20</span>.) </p><p>This passage has tortured the ingenuity of Origen, but to no purpose. If God summon consciences to his tribunal, that those qualities in their transgression, which would otherwise give them pleasure, may humble them by a conviction of guilt, — if he shake off the listlessness which overwhelmed all dread of his judgment-seat, — if he drag to light; sin, which lurked like a thief in the den of hypocrisy, — what is there in all this that can be reckoned absurd? But it may be objected: “As the law is the rule of a devout and holy life, why is it said to be added ‘because of transgressions,’ rather than ‘because of obedience?’” I answer, however much it may point out true righteousness, yet, owing to the corruption of our nature, its instruction tends only to increase transgressions, until the Spirit of regeneration come, who writes it on the heart; and that Spirit is not given by the law, but is received by faith. This saying of Paul, let the reader remember, is not of a philosophical or political character, but expresses a purpose of the law, with which the world had been always unacquainted. </p><p><em>Till the seed should come</em>. If it has respect <em>to seed</em>, it must be to that on which the blessing has been pronounced, and therefore it does not interfere with the promise. The word till, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἄχρις οὗ,</span>) signifies <em>so long as </em>the seed is expected: and hence it follows, that it must have been intended to occupy not the highest, but a subordinate rank. It was given in order to rouse men to the expectation of Christ. But was it necessary that it should last only until the coming of Christ? For if so, it follows that it is now abolished. The whole of that administration, I reply, was temporal, and was given for the purpose of preserving among the ancient people an attachment to the faith of Christ. And yet I do not admit that, by the coming of Christ, the whole law was abolished. The apostle did not intend this, but merely that the mode of administration, which for a time had been introduced, must receive its accomplishment in Christ, who is the fulfillment of the promise. <span class="cite-ref">(60)</span> But on this subject we shall have occasion to speak more fully afterwards. </p><p><em>Ordained by angels</em>. The circumstance, that it was delivered through angels, tends to the commendation of the law. This is declared by Stephen (<span class="bvs">Act_7:53</span>) also, who says, that they had “received the law, (<span class="lang el-gr">εἰς διαταγὰς ἀγγέλων,</span>) into the dispositions of angels.” The interpretation given by some, that Moses and Aaron, and the priests, are the angels here meant, is more ingenious than solid. Nor is it wonderful that angels, by whom God bestows on us some of the smallest of his blessings, should have been intrusted also with this office of attending as witnesses at the promulgation of the law. </p><p><em>In the hand of a Mediator Hand </em>usually signifies ministration; but as angels were ministers in giving the law, I consider “the hand of the Mediator” to denote the highest rank of service. The Mediator was at the head of the embassy, and angels were united with him as his companions. Some apply this expression to Moses, as marking a comparison between Moses and Christ; but I agree rather with the ancient expositors, who apply it to Christ himself. <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> This view, it will be found, agrees better with the context, though I differ from the ancients likewise as to the meaning of the word. <em>Mediator </em>does not, as they imagine, signify here one who makes reconciliation, which it does in these words, </p><p>“There is one Mediator between God and men,<LineBreak />the man Christ Jesus,” (<span class="bvs">1Ti_2:5</span>,) </p><p>— but an ambassador employed in promulgating a law. </p><p>We are thus to understand, that, since the beginning of the world, God has held no intercourse with men, but through the agency of his eternal Wisdom or Son. Hence Peter says, that the holy prophets spake by the “Spirit of Christ,” (<span class="bvs">1Pe_1:11</span>,) and Paul makes him the leader of the people in the wilderness. (<span class="bvs">1Co_10:4</span>.) And certainly the Angel who appeared to Moses, (<span class="bvs">Exo_3:2</span>,) can be no other person; for he claims to himself the peculiar and essential name of God, which is never applied to creatures. As he is the Mediator of reconciliation, by whom we are accepted of God, — the Mediator of intercession, who opens up for us a way to “call on the Father,” (<span class="bvs">1Pe_1:17</span>,) — so he has always been the Mediator of all doctrine, because by him God has always revealed himself to men. And this he intended to state expressly, for the purpose of informing the Galatians, that he who is the foundation of the covenant of grace, held also the highest rank in the giving of the law. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(60)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui est le parfait accomplissement de la promesse</span>.” “Who is the perfect accomplishment of the promise.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(61)</span> “Though some learned men have been of opinion that the mediator here mentioned is the Son of God, yet I think no reasonable doubt can be entertained as to its denoting Moses. Strictly speaking, Aaron, or rather the priesthood, was the mediator of the old covenant. It answers to the Great High-Priest, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀρχιερεύς</span>,) Mediator, (<span class="lang el-gr">μεσίτης</span>,) and Surety, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἔγγυος</span>,) of the new covenant. But the reference seems here to the <em>giving </em>of the law: that was by Moses. ‘The law was given by Moses.’ (<span class="bvs">Joh_1:17</span>.) God speaks to Moses, and Moses speaks to the people; and this arrangement was entered into by the express request of the people themselves. Moses himself says, ‘I stood between the Lord and you at that time. (<span class="bvs">Deu_5:5</span>.) Philo calls Moses <span class="lang el-gr">μεσίτης</span>.” — Brown. </p></div></div>
