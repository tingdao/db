And this seems to be spoken of by way of concession, as if God would pass over all His former decrees, and invite the people afresh to take cognizance of the matter. With this view tie states that He will put an end to all the malevolent and noisy detractions of the people, so that Aaron may henceforth exercise his office without controversy; for, although not even thus was their perverseness altogether cured, still their insolence was restrained. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(105)</span><em>Fr., </em>“A la seconde declaration.” </p></div></div>
