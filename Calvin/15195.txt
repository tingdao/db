<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>Help O God of our salvation! </em>They again repeat in this verse, that whatever afflictions they endured were to be traced to the anger of God, and that they could have no comfort under them unless He were reconciled to them. Being deeply sensible that they had committed many transgressions, to strengthen their hope of obtaining pardon, they employ a variety of expressions. In the first place, as an argument to induce God to show them favor, they address him as <em>the God of their salvation. </em>In the second place, they testify that they bring nothing of their own to influence him to have mercy upon them; and that the only plea which they present before him is his own glory. From this we learn, that sinners are not reconciled to God by satisfactions or by the merit of good works, but by a free and an unmerited forgiveness. The observation which I have made a little before, and which I have explained more at length on the sixth psalm, is here to be kept in mind, — That when God visits us with the rod, instead of being merely desirous to be relieved from external chastisements, our chief concern ought to be to have God pacified towards us: nor should we follow the example of foolish sick persons, who are anxious to have merely the symptoms of their disease removed, and make no account of being delivered from the source and cause of it. With respect to the word <span class="lang he-il">כפר</span>, <em>chapper, </em><span class="cite-ref">(376)</span> which expositors translate, <em>Be merciful, </em>or <em>propitious, </em>I have had an opportunity of speaking in another place. It properly signifies <em>to cleanse, </em>or <em>expiate, </em>and is applied to sacrifices. Whenever, therefore, we desire to obtain the favor of God, let us call to remembrance the death of Christ; for “without shedding of blood is no remissions” (<span class="bvs">Heb_9:22</span>.) </p><p><strong>(376)</strong> “<span class="lang he-il">כפר</span>, <em>chapper</em>, <em>be propitiated</em>, or <em>receive an atonement </em>(<span class="lang he-il">על הטאתינו</span>,<em>al chatoteinu</em>)<em>on account of our sins</em>. ” —<em>Dr Adam Clarke </em></p></div>
