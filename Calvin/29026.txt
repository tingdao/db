<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>In paradise </em><span class="cite-ref">(889)</span> As every region that is peculiarly agreeable and delightful <span class="cite-ref">(890)</span> is called in the Scriptures the <em>garden of God, </em>it came from this to be customary among the Greeks to employ the term <em>paradise </em>to denote the heavenly glory, even previously to Christ’s advent, as appears from Ecclesiasticus. (<span class="bvs">Sir_40:17</span>.) It is also used in this sense in <span class="bvs">Luk_23:43</span>, in Christ’s answer to the robber — “To-day shalt thou be with me in <em>paradise, </em>” that is, “Thou shalt enjoy the presence of God, in the condition and life of the blessed.” </p><p><em>Heard unspeakable words </em>By <em>words </em>here I do not understand <em>things, </em>as the term is wont to be made use of after the manner of the Hebrews; <span class="cite-ref">(891)</span> for the word <em>heard </em>would not correspond with this. Now if any one inquires, what they were, the answer is easy — that it is not without good reason that they are called <em>unspeakable </em><span class="cite-ref">(892)</span><em>words, </em>and such as it is unlawful to utter. Some one, however, will reply, that what Paul heard was, consequently, needless and useless, for what purpose did it serve to hear, what was to be buried in perpetual silence? I answer, that this took place for the sake of Paul himself, for one who had such arduous difficulties awaiting him, enough to break a thousand hearts, required to be strengthened by special means, that he might not give way, but might persevere undaunted. <span class="cite-ref">(893)</span> Let us consider for a little, how many adversaries his doctrine had, and of what sort they were; and farther, with what a variety of artifices it was assailed, and then we shall wonder no longer, why he heard more than it was<em>lawful for him to utter </em></p><p>From this, too, we may gather a most useful admonition as to setting bounds to knowledge. We are naturally prone to curiosity. Hence, neglecting altogether, or tasting but slightly, and carelessly, doctrine that tends to edification, we are hurried on to frivolous questions. Then there follow upon this — boldness and rashness, so that we do not hesitate to decide on matters unknown, and concealed. </p><p>From these two sources has sprung up a great part <span class="cite-ref">(894)</span> of scholastic theology, and every thing, which that trifler Dionysius <span class="cite-ref">(895)</span> has been so daring as to contrive in reference to the Heavenly Hierarchies, It becomes us so much the more to keep within bounds, <span class="cite-ref">(896)</span> so as not to seek to know any thing, but what the Lord has seen it good to reveal to his Church. Let this be the limit of our knowledge. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(889)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>The word <em>paradise </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">παράδεισος)</span> occurs but three times in the New Testament, (<span class="bvs">Luk_23:43</span>, <span class="bvs">2Co_12:4</span>, and <span class="bvs">Rev_2:7</span>.) It occurs often in the Septuagint, as the translation of the word garden, (<span class="lang he-il">גן</span>) <em>gan; </em>and of the word (<span class="lang he-il">פרדס</span>) <em>pardes, </em>in <span class="bvs">Neh_2:8</span>, <span class="bvs">Ecc_2:5</span>, <span class="bvs">Son_2:13</span>. It is a word which had its origin in the language of Eastern Asia, and which has been adopted in the Greek, the Roman, and other western languages. In Sanscrit, the word <em>paradesha </em>means a land elevated and cultivated; in Armenian, <em>pardes </em>denotes a garden around the house, planted with trees, shrubs, grass for use and ornament. In Persia, the word denotes the <em>pleasure-gardens, </em>and <em>parks </em>with wild animals, around the country residences of the monarchs and princes. Hence it denotes, in general, a garden of pleasure; and in the New Testament is applied to the abodes of the blessed after death, the dwelling-place of God, and of happy spirits; or to heaven as a place of blessedness.” — <em>Barnes. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(890)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Toute region delectable et excellente en fertilite et abundance de biens de la terre</span>;” — “Every region that is delightful and distinguished by fertility and abundance of the good things of the earth.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(891)</span> Calvin’s meaning evidently is, that <span class="lang el-gr">ῥήματα,</span> here rendered <em>words, </em>is often made use of, like the corresponding Hebrew word, <span class="lang he-il">דברין</span> (<em>dabarim,</em>) to mean <em>things. </em>Accordingly <span class="lang he-il">דבר</span><em>, </em>(<em>dabar,</em>) when employed to denote <em>thing, </em>is very frequently rendered in the Septuagint by <span class="lang el-gr">ῥήμα,</span> as, for example, in <span class="bvs">Gen_18:14</span>, <span class="bvs">Exo_18:17</span>, <span class="bvs">Deu_17:1</span>. Calvin, when commenting on the <em>expression </em>— <em>with God nothing shall be impossible, </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_1:37</span>,) remarks that “a <em>word </em>often means a <em>thing </em>in the idiom of the Hebrew language, which the Evangelists followed, though they wrote in Greek.” — Calvin’s Harmony, vol. 1, p. 45.—<em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(892)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Secretes, ou impossibles a dire</span>;” — “Secret, or such as it is impossible to utter.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(893)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Mais qu’il perseuerast constamment, sans se laisser vainere</span>;” — “But might persevere steadfastly, without allowing himself to be overcome.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(894)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">La plus grande partie</span>;” — “The greatest part.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(895)</span> Calvin refers here to one Dionysius, whose writings appear to have been looked upon by many in Calvin’s times, as having been composed by Dionysius the Areopagite, who was converted by Paul at Athens. (<span class="bvs">Act_17:34</span>.) A copy of the work referred to, printed at Paris in 1555, bears the following title: “S. Dionysii Areopagitae, Martyris Inclyti, Athenarum Episcopi, et Galliarum Apostoli, opera-Translatio Noua Ambrosii Florentini,” <em>etc</em>. ; — “The works of St. Dionysius the Areopagite, the renowned Martyr, Bishop of Athens, and Apostle of the Gauls — a New Translation by Ambrosius Florentine,” etc. — Calvin, in his Institutes, (volume 1,) when treating of angels, adverts to the writings of Dionysius, in the following terms: “None can deny that Dionysius (whoever he may have been) has many shrewd and subtle disquisitions in his Celestial Hierarchy, but on looking at them more closely, every one must see that they are merely idle talk. The duty of a theologian, however, is not to tickle the ear, but confirm the conscience, by teaching what is true, certain, and useful. When you read the work of Dionysius, you would think that the man had come down from heaven, and was relating, not what he had learned, but what he had actually seen. Paul, however, though he was carried to the third heaven, so far from delivering any thing of the kind positively, declares, that it was not lawful for man to speak the secrets which he had seen. Bidding adieu, therefore, to that nugatory wisdom, let us endeavor to ascertain from the simple doctrine of Scripture, what it is the Lord’s pleasure that we should know concerning angels.” — <em>Beza, </em>in his Annotations on <span class="bvs">1Co_3:15</span>, when expounding the expression — “he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire,” makes mention of Dionysius, as having been, in his opinion, Bishop of Corinth, and speaks of him as having devoted himself to unprofitable speculations, and as harassing himself, for the most part in vain, in describing the Celestial Hierarchy. — The Rhemish Translators, when commenting on <span class="bvs">Act_17:34</span>, contend for the genuineness of the writings referred to. “<em>Dionysius Areopaita </em> This is that famous Denys that first converted France, and wrote those notable and divine works — ’<span class="lang fr-fr">De Ecclesiastica et Caelesti Hierarchia, de diuinis nominibus</span>,’ and others; in which he confirmeth, and proveth plainely, almost all things that the Church now useth in the ministration of the Holy Sacrament, and affirmeth that he learned them of the Apostles, giving also testimony for the Catholike faith in most things now controuersed, so plainely that our adversaries have no shift but to deny this Denys to have been the author of them, raining that they be another’s of later age.” To these statements Dr. Fulke, in his elaborate work in refutation of the errors of the Rhemish Translators, (p. 403,) replies as follows: “That Dionysius Areopagita was author of those bookes which now beare his name, you bring no proofe at all. We alleage that Eusebius, Hierome, Gennadius, neuer heard of his writings, for if they had heard, Dionysius Areopagita should have been registered by them among ecclesiasticall writers.” — It is stated by <em>Mosheim </em>in his Ecclesiastical History, (London 1825,) volume 2, <em>n. </em>(<em>u</em>)<em>, </em>that “<em>the </em>spuriousness of these works is now universally granted by the most learned and impartial of the Roman Catholic writers, as they contain accounts of many events that happened several ages after the time of Dionysius, and were not at all mentioned until after the fifth century.” <em>Turretine </em>in his Theology brings forward, at considerable length, evidence to show, that the work referred to was not, as pretended, the production of Dionysius the Areopagite, who was “<span class="lang el-gr">σύγχρονος </span> Apostolis,” (“a contemporary of the Apostles,”) but was written by an author of much later date — born in the fifth <em>century. </em>— <em>Turretini </em>Theologia, (Genevae, 1690,) tom. 3, pp. 233, 234. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(896)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Il faut que nous soyons d’autant plus sobres et modestes</span>;” — “It is necessary, that we should be so much the more sober and modest.” </p></div></div>
