<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>But God is faithful</em>. As it was possible that their minds, influenced by unfavorable reports, might come to entertain some doubts as to Paul’s ministry, having taught them that faith is not always found in men, he now calls them back to God, and says that he is <em>faithful</em>, so as to confirm them against all contrivances of men, by which they will endeavor to shake them. “They, indeed, are treacherous, but there is in God a support that is abundantly secure, so as to keep you from giving way.” He calls the Lord <em>faithful</em>, inasmuch as he adheres to his purpose to the end in maintaining the salvation of his people, seasonably aids them, and never forsakes them in dangers, as in <span class="bvs">1Co_10:13</span>, </p><p>God is faithful, who will not suffer<LineBreak />you to be tried above that ye are able to bear. </p><p>These words, however, themselves shew that Paul was more anxious as to others than as to himself. Malicious men directed against him the stings of their malignity; the whole violence <span class="cite-ref">(697)</span> of it fell upon him. In the mean time, he directs all his anxieties towards the Thessalonians, lest this temptation should do them any injury. </p><p>The term <em>evil </em>may refer as well to the thing, that is, malice, as to the persons of the wicked. I prefer, however, to interpret it of Satan, the head of all the wicked. For it were a small thing to be delivered from the cunning or violence of men, if the Lord did not protect us from all spiritual injury. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(697)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Toute la violence et impetuosite</span>;” — “The whole violence and impetuosity.” </p></div></div>
