<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Three times in a year. </em>We have previously said that although the other feast-days were not to be neglected, still, because God would make some allowance for the infirmity of His people, the necessity of going up to Jerusalem five times a year was not imposed upon them. Again, because only half of the seventh month contained three feast-days, i.e., from the first to the fifteenth, for the same reason it is only required of the males that they should leave their houses and celebrate the sacred convocations; for thus the females are spared, to whom traveling is not so convenient. Besides, through the fecundity promised them by God, they were almost always either pregnant or nursing. It is also certain that the boys and young men were excepted under the age of twenty, since God includes under the term males only those who were comprised in the census. If any object that in God’s spiritual worship there is no difference between males and females; the reply is easy, that the fathers of families presented themselves there in the names of their wives and children: so that the profession was extended to the other sex, and to those of tender age. To this David seems to allude, when he says: <span class="cite-ref">(364)</span></p><p>"Thy people shall come with voluntary offerings in the day of thy assembly, in the beauties of holiness,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_110:3</span>;) </p><p>for, speaking of the free-will-offerings of the people, he seeks an example of it, after the manner of the prophets, from the legal worship. Lest the Jews should object that there was danger of hostile invasion, if the land should be stripped of its defenses by the gathering together of all the men into one place, God anticipates this doubt in <span class="bvs">Exo_34:0</span>, promising that He will provide that no one shall desire to assail their forsaken homes; for to this the sentence refers: “<em>I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders, so that no man shall desire thy land</em>, ” <span class="bvs">Exo_34:24</span> Whence also we gather, that God’s worship was not entirely established until all the neighboring nations were subdued, and He had placed His sanctuary in Mount Zion. Not that it was allowable for the people to omit the feast-days before that time; but that experience itself might teach them that God was wroth with them, whilst He deprived them of this special blessing; for fear and alarm arose only from their own fault. But let believers collect from hence the useful doctrine that, whenever they are following God, they will be safe under His protection, since it is in His power to repel the assaults of enemies, and everything that can harm them. </p><p><em>And they shall not appear before the Lord empty, </em><span class="cite-ref">(365)</span> I know not how it could have entered the minds of some to suppose that God here promised that all should be rich who should present themselves three times (a year) before His sanctuary: whereas it is plain from the words of Moses that He requires from every one some gift in token of their gratitude. And perhaps <span class="cite-ref">(366)</span> what historians relate respecting the Persians, that none should dare to address the king without a gift, was a more ancient custom, and common to other nations. God would indeed have a gift presented Him by each individual, as a symbol or earnest of their subjection; and, although this legal rite has ceased, yet its substance is to be retained, viz., that those only are true servants of God who do not boastfully make a mere empty profession, but effectually testify that they acknowledge Him as their King. </p><p><strong>(364)</strong> “Populus tuus liberalitatum est,” <em>etc. </em>—<em>Lat. “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Ton peuple est de franche volonte</span>,” etc. — <em>Fr. </em>See <em>Calvin </em>on <span class="bvs">Psa_110:0</span>, Calvin Translation Society’s Edition, vol. 4, p. 296, and note, p. 301. </p><p><strong>(365)</strong> “Others thus explain it, viz., that you should not be troubled at having to go so often to Jerusalem, because you should never go there in vain: some blessing shall always be brought away; I will not send you away empty.” <em>Fagii Coll.

When he went on his progress, or marched out with his army, all the inhabitants of the countries or provinces through which he passed were obliged to declare their vassalage by some present or other; even the inhabitants of the villages and fields flocked to him with some donation, some offering sheep, oxen, corn, wine, etc.; others milk, cheese, dates, etc., every one according to his ability.” Ancient Universal Hist., Vol. 5:139, from Aeliani Var.
