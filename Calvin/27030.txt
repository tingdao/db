<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Peter, being filled with the Holy Ghost </em>It is not without great cause that Luke addeth this, to the end we may know that Peter spake not with such a majesty of himself. And surely, seeing he had denied his Master, Christ, being afraid at the voice of a silly woman, (<span class="bvs">Mat_26:70</span>,) he should have utterly fainted in such an assembly, when he did only behold their pomp, unless he had been upholden by the power of the Spirit. He had great need of wisdom and strength. <span class="cite-ref">(205)</span> He excelleth in both these so much, that his answer is indeed divine. He is another manner of man here than he was before. Furthermore, this profiteth us two manner of ways. For this title, or commendation, is of no small force to set forth the doctrine which shall follow immediately, when it is said that it came from the Holy God, [Spirit.] And we are taught to crave at the hands of the Lord the Spirit of wisdom and strength, when we make profession of our faith, to direct our hearts and minds. The fullness of the Spirit is taken for a large and no common measure. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(205)</span> “Fortitudine et prudentia,” prudence and fortitude. </p></div></div>
