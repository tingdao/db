<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>For thou, Jehovah, wilt bless the righteous. </em>The Psalmist here confirms the concluding sentence of the preceding verse, namely, that all the servants of God in common will take support to their faith from what he had experienced, for he would have us from one example to form our judgment of the immutability and perpetuity of God’s grace towards all the godly. Again, by this he teaches us that there is no true and right joy but that which is derived from the sense of God’s fatherly love. The word, <em>to bless, </em>in Hebrew, (when we speak of this as the act of men,) signifies to wish happiness and prosperity to any one, and to pray for him; <span class="cite-ref">(79)</span> but when it is spoken of as the act of God, it signifies the same thing as to prosper a man, or to enrich him abundantly with all good things; for since the favor of God is efficacious, his blessing of itself produces an abundance of every good thing. The name <em>righteous </em>is not restricted to any one man, but signifies in general all the servants of God. Those, however, who are called righteous in Scripture, are not so called on account of the merit of their works, but because they aspire after righteousness; for after God has received them into his favor, by not imputing their sins to them, he accepts their upright endeavors for perfect righteousness. What follows is of the same import as the preceding clause, <em>Thou wilt crown them with thy free favor, </em>or good will, <em>as with a shield </em>The Psalmist’s meaning is, that the faithful shall be completely defended on all sides, since he will, in no case, withhold from them his grace, which is to them an invincible fortress, and brings along with it certain safety. The word, <em>to crown, </em>which the Psalmist employs, often denotes in Hebrew, <em>ornament </em>or <em>glory; </em>but as there is added the similitude of a shield, I have no doubt but he uses it metaphorically for, <em>to fortify </em>or <em>to compass about. </em><span class="cite-ref">(80)</span> The meaning, therefore, is, that however great and various may be the dangers which besiege the righteous, they shall, notwithstanding, escape, and be saved, because God is favorable to them. </p><p><strong>(79)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Signifie, souhaitter bien et prosperite a quelquun et prier pour luy</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(80)</strong> Bishop Horsley thinks <span class="lang he-il">כצנה</span>, <em>katsinah, as with a shield, </em>should be construed with <span class="lang he-il">רצונ</span><em>ratson, favor </em>or <em>good will, </em>and translates the words thus: ”Like a shield of good will, thou wilt stand guard around him.” The reading of the Septuagint is the same: <span class="lang el-gr">Ως ὁπλω εὐδοκιας</span>, <em>as with a shield of good will. </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">צנה</span><em>tsinah, </em>means that kind of shield, from the middle of which there arose a large boss, surmounted by a dagger and which was highly useful both as a defensive and an offensive weapon in ancient warfare. </p></div>
