<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet in this verse contends more sharply with the Jews, and shows that it was a mere presence that they so much expected the coming of the Mediator, for they were far different from him through the whole course of their life. And when he says that the coming of Christ would be intolerable, what is said is to be confined to the ungodly; for we know that nothing is more delightful and sweeter to us than when Christ is nigh us: though now we are pilgrims and at a distance from him, yet his invisible presence is our chief joy and happiness. (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:22</span>.) Besides, were not the expectation of his coming to sustain our minds, how miserable would be our condition! It is therefore by this mark that the faithful are to be distinguished, — that they expect his coming; and Paul does not in vain exhort us, by the example of heaven and earth, to be like those in travail, until Christ appears to us as our Redeemer. </p><p>But the Prophet here directs his discourse to the ungodly, who though they seem to burn with desire for God’s presence, do not yet wish him to be nigh them, but they flee from him as much as they can. We have met with a similar passage in Amos, </p><p>“Wo to those who desire the day of the Lord! What will it be to you? for it will be darkness, yea darkness and not light, a day of sorrow and not of joy.” (<span class="bvs">Amo_5:18</span>.) </p><p>Amos in this passage spoke on the same subject; for the Jews, inflated with false confidence, thought that God could not forsake them, as he had pledged his faith to them; but he reminded them that God had been so provoked by their sins, that he was become their professed and sworn enemy. So also in this place, <em>Come</em>, the Prophet says, <em>come shall the Redeemer</em>; but this will avail you nothing; on the contrary, his coming will be dreadful to you. We indeed know that Christ appeared not for salvation to all, but only to the remnant, and to those of Jacob who repented, according to what Isaiah says. (<span class="bvs">Isa_10:21</span>.) But since they obstinately rejected the favor of God, it is no wonder that the Prophet excluded them from the blessings of the Redeemer. </p><p><em>Who </em>then <em>will endure his coming? </em><span class="cite-ref">(246)</span><em>and who shall stand at his appearance? </em>as though he had said, “In vain do ye flatter yourselves, and even upbraid God, that he retains the promised Redeemer as it were hidden in his own bosom; for he will come in due time, but without any advantage to you; nor will it be given you to enjoy his favor; but on the contrary he will bring to you nothing but terrors; for <em>he will be like a purifying fire, and as the herb of the fullers </em><span class="cite-ref">(247)</span> The latter clause may be taken in a good or a bad sense, as it is evident from the next verse. The power of the fire, we know, is twofold; for it burns and it purifies; it burns what is corrupt; but it purifies gold and silver from their dross. The Prophet no doubt meant to include both, for in the next verse he says, that Christ will be as fire to purify and to refine the sons of Levi as gold and silver. With regard then to the people of whom he has been hitherto speaking, he shows that Christ will be like fire, to burn and consume their filth; for though they boasted with their mouth of their religion, yet we know that the Church of God had many defilements and pollutions; they were therefore to perish by fire. But Malachi teaches us at the same time, that the whole Church was not to perish, for the Lord would <em>purify the sons of Levi </em></p><p>There is here a part stated for the whole; for the promise belongs to the whole Church. The sons of Levi were the first-fruits, and the whole people were in the name of that tribe consecrated to God. This is the reason why he mentions the sons of Levi rather than the whole people; as though he had said, that though the Church was corrupt and polluted, there would yet be a residue which God would save, having purified them. The words which I had omitted are these - </p><p><strong>(246)</strong> For “who will endure,” the <em>Vulgate</em>, after <em>Jerome</em>, has, “quis poterit cogitare — who can think of?” etc. But this is inconsistent with the <em>Septuagint </em>and the <em>Targum</em>, and with the context. The verb indeed is capable of being derived from <span class="lang he-il">כל</span> as well as from <span class="lang he-il">יכל</span>; but the latter is the meaning alone suitable to this passage. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(247)</strong> The version of the <em>Septuagint </em>is “<span class="lang el-gr">ὡς πῦρ χωνευτηρίου καὶ ὡς πόα πλυνόντων</span> — as the fire of the crucible (or, of the furnace) and as the herb of the washers.” The word, <span class="lang he-il">מצרף</span>, may be either a participle or a noun—the refiner or the place or instrument of refining. See <span class="bvs">Pro_17:3</span>. The latter sense is most suitable to this place. “Herb” is rendered “smegma — soap,” by <em>Picator</em>, — “Lanaria -cudwort,” by <em>Drusius</em>, —and “alkaline salt,” by <em>Michaelis</em>. It was probably the salt-wort mentioned by an author quoted by <em>Parkhurst</em>, a plant very common in Judea. It was burned, and water was poured on its ashes. This water became impregnated with strong lixivial salt, “proper for taking,” he says, “stains and impurities out of wool or cloth.” It is not supposed that what we call “soap” was known to the Jews. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
