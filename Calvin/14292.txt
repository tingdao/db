Here, therefore, David, though in banishment, and prohibited from approaching the temple, boasts that he would again come to the altar of God, and offer the sacrifice of praise. It appears, however, that he tacitly sets the holy rejoicing and songs, in which he promises to give thanks to God, in opposition to the profane triumphings of the world. </p><p><strong>(583)</strong> “Sacrificia jubili.” —<em>Lat. </em>“<span class="lang fr-fr">Sacrifice de triomphe</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. <em>Ainsworth </em>reads, “Sacrifices of shouting, or of triumph, of joyful sounding and alarm.” “This,” says he, “hath respect to the law which appointed over the sacrifices trumpets to be sounded, <span class="bvs">Num_10:10</span>, whose chiefest, most loud, joyful, and triumphant sound was called <em>trughnah, </em>[or <span class="lang he-il">תרועה</span>, <em>truah, </em>the word here used,] ‘triumph,’ ‘alarm,’ or ‘jubilation,’ <span class="bvs">Num_10:5</span>.” </p></div>
