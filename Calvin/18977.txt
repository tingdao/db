<div class="comment-content"><p>Hence he says, <em>Yea, pass over unto the islands; </em>and then he adds, <em>see whether there is a thing like this; </em>that is, such a monstrous and execrable thing can nowhere be found. An explanation follows, <em>No nation has changed its gods, and yet they are no gods; </em>that is, religion among all nations continues the same, so that they do not now and then change their gods, but worship those who have been as it were handed down to them by their fathers. <em>And yet, </em>he says, <em>they are no gods </em>If it had been only said, that no nation has changed its gods, the impiety of Israel would not have been so grievously exposed; but the Prophet takes it for granted, that all the nations were deceived and led away after fictitious gods, and yet remained constant in their delusions. Now, God does not set this forth as a virtue; he does not mean that the constancy of the nations was worthy of praise in not departing from their own superstitions; but, compared with the conduct of the chosen people, this constancy might however appear as laudable. We hence see that the whole is to be thus read connectively, — “Though no nation worships the true God, yet religion remains unchangeable among them all; and yet ye have perfidiously forsaken me, and you have not forsaken a mere phantom, but your <em>glory</em>. ” </p><p>He sets here the favor of God in opposition to the delusions of false gods, when he says, <em>My people have changed their own glory </em>For the people knew, not only through the teaching of the law, but also by sure evidences, that God was their glory; and yet they departed from him. It is then the same as though Jeremiah had said, that all the nations would condemn the Israelites at the last day, because their very persistency in error would prove the greater wickedness of the Jews, inasmuch as they were apostates from the true God, and from that God who had so clearly manifested to them his power. </p><p>Now, if one asks, whether religion has been changed by any of the nations? First, we know that this principle prevailed everywhere, — that there was to be no innovation in the substance of religion: and Xenophon highly commends this oracle of Apollo, — that those gods were rightly worshipped who have been received by tradition from ancestors. The devil had thus bewitched all nations, — “No novelty can please God; but be ye content with the usual custom which has descended to you from your forefathers.” This principle then was held by the Greeks and the Asiatics, and also by Europeans. It was therefore for the most part true what the Prophet says here: and we know that when a comparison is made, it is enough if the illustration is for the most part, <span class="lang el-gr">επὶ τὸ πολὺ</span>, as Aristotle says, confirmed by custom and constant practice. We hence see that the charge of levity against the Jews was not unsuitably brought by Jeremiah, when he said, that no nation had changed its gods, but that God had been forsaken by his people whose <em>glory </em>he was; that is, to whom he had given abundant reasons for glorying. <span class="cite-ref">(38)</span></p><p><strong>(38)</strong> “Their glory” are by some considered to be God himself, and not the glory, that is, the honor, dignity, and greatness which he bestowed on the people, as <em>Calvin </em>here intimates: but the latter is more consistent with what follows, which literally is, “for nothing that profits:” for the <span class="lang he-il">לא</span> here, as in <span class="bvs">Jer_2:8</span>, is evidently a noun, or a pronoun. The comparison here is between what God gives and what false gods give; the comparison before was between God himself and the false gods. God gives glory, renders his people great and illustrious; but the false gods give nothing that profits, that really benefits, or does any good. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
