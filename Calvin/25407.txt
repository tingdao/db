<div class="comment-content"><p>It is uncertain whether this form was once only or twice delivered by Christ to his disciples. <span class="cite-ref">(429)</span> Some think that the latter is more probable; because Luke says that he was requested to do it, while Matthew represents him as teaching it of his own accord. But as we have said, that Matthew collects all the leading points of doctrine, in order that the whole amount of them may be more clearly perceived by the readers when they are placed in close succession, it is possible that Matthew may have omitted to mention the occasion which is related by Luke. On this subject, however, I am unwilling to debate with any person. </p><p><span class="bvs">Luk_11:1</span><em>As John also taught his diciples. </em>John delivered to his disciples a particular form of prayer; and he did so, in my opinion, because the time required it. The state of affairs among the Jews was, at that time, exceedingly corrupted. Every thing connected with religion had so miserably fallen, that we need not be surprised to find few among them, by whom prayer was offered in a proper manner. <span class="cite-ref">(430)</span> Besides, it was proper, that the minds of believers should be excited, by prayer, to hope and desire the promised redemption, which was at hand. John might, therefore, have collected, out of various passages of Scripture, a certain prayer adapted to the time, and approaching more nearly to the spiritual kingdom of Christ, which had already begun to be revealed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(429)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il est incertain si Christ a enseigne ceste formule de prier a ses disciples une fois seulement, ou bien par deux diverses fois</span>.” — “It is uncertain if Christ taught this form of prayer to his disciples once only, or rather at two separate times.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(430)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ne se faut pas fort esbahir si la vraye et pure maniere de prier estoit pratiquee par bien peu de gens</span>.” — “We ought not to be greatly surprised, if the true and pure manner of praying was practiced by very few people.” </p></div></div>
