<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Who for the joy that was set before him, etc. </em>Though the expression in Latin is somewhat ambiguous, yet according to the words in Greek the Apostle’s meaning is quite clear; for he intimates, that though it was free to Christ to exempt himself from all trouble and to lead a happy life, abounding in all good things, he yet underwent a death that was bitter, and in every way ignominious. For the expression, <em>for joy, </em>is the same as, instead of joy; and joy includes every kind of enjoyment. And he says, <em>set before him, </em>because the power of availing himself of this joy was possessed by Christ, had it so pleased him. At the same time if any one thinks that the preposition<span class="lang el-gr">ἀντὶ </span> denotes the final cause, I do not much object; then the meaning would be, that Christ refused not the death of the cross, because he saw its blessed issue. I still prefer the former exposition. <span class="cite-ref">(244)</span></p><p>But he commends to us the patience of Christ on two accounts, because he endured a most bitter death, and because he despised shame. He then mentions the glorious end of his death, that the faithful might know that all the evils which they may endure will end in their salvation and glory, provided they follow Christ. So also says James, “Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and ye know the end.” (<span class="bvs">Jas_5:11</span>.) Then the Apostle means that the end of our sufferings will be the same with those of Christ, according to what is said by Paul, “If we suffer with him, we shall also reign together.” (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:17</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(244)</span> See Appendix Q 2. </p></div></div>
