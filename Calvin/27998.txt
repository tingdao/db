<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>If indeed </em><span class="cite-ref">(92)</span><em>the truth of God, etc. </em>This objection, I have no doubt, is adduced in the person of the ungodly; for it is a sort of an explanation of the former verse, and would have been connected with it, had not the Apostle, moved with indignation, broken off the sentence in the middle. The meaning of the objection is — “If by our unfaithfulness the truth of God becomes more conspicuous, and in a manner confirmed, and hence more glory redounds to him, it is by no means just, that he, who serves to display God’s glory, should be punished as a sinner.” <span class="cite-ref">(93)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(92)</span> Or, “For if” — <em>Si enim </em><span class="lang el-gr">— εἰ γὰρ. </span> The particle γὰρ here gives no reason, but is to be viewed as meaning <em>then</em>, or <em>indeed, verily; </em>see <span class="bvs">Luk_12:58</span>; <span class="bvs">Joh_9:30</span>; <span class="bvs">Act_16:37</span>; <span class="bvs">Phi_2:27</span> [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] renders it, <em>still, </em>and says, that it “points to a connection with verse. 5, and denotes a <em>continuance </em>of the same theme.” [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] often renders it by <em>further, besides, </em>and no doubt rightly. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(93)</span> It is remarkable how the Apostle changes his words from the third verse to the end of this, while the same things are essentially meant. His style is throughout Hebraistic. [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] makes these just remarks<span class="lang el-gr">, “Αδικία </span> is here [<span class="bvs">Rom_3:5</span> ] the <em>generic </em>appellation of sin, for which a specific name<span class="lang el-gr">, ἀπιστία, </span> was employed in <span class="bvs">Rom_3:3</span>, and<span class="lang el-gr">ψεῦσμα, </span> in <span class="bvs">Rom_3:7</span>. In like manner the<span class="lang el-gr">δικαιοσύνη, </span> in <span class="bvs">Rom_3:5</span>, which is a generic appellation, is expressed by a specific one<span class="lang el-gr">, πίστιν, </span> in <span class="bvs">Rom_3:3</span>, and by<span class="lang el-gr">ἀλήθεια, </span> in <span class="bvs">Rom_3:7</span>. The idea is substantially the same, which is designated by these respectively corresponding appellations. <em>Fidelity, uprightness, integrity, </em>are designated by<span class="lang el-gr">πίστιν, δικαιοσύνην, </span> and <span class="lang el-gr">ἀλήθεια; </span> while <span class="lang el-gr">ἀλήθεια, </span> and <span class="lang el-gr">ἀπιστία ἀδικία, </span> designate <em>unfaithfulness, want of uprightness </em>and <em>false dealing. </em>All of these terms have more or less reference to the <span class="lang he-il">ברית</span>, <em>covenant </em>or <em>compact </em>(so to speak) which existed between God and his ancient people.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
