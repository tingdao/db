<div class="comment-content"><p>There was here, as it were, an extreme wickedness, for the Jews had profaned the Temple itself. It was a grievous offense, when every one had, as we have seen, private services at home, where they burned incense on the roofs, and poured libations to foreign gods; but when impiety had gone so far, that even the Temple itself was polluted with idols, what hope was there of repentance? </p><p>He says that they had <em>set their abominations </em>in the Temple. It is called, indeed, a <em>house </em>after the manner of the Hebrews, but it is afterwards distinguished from private buildings, when he says, <em>on which my name is called </em><span class="cite-ref">(74)</span> and then, <em>that they might defile it </em>God here shews that the Temple had been dedicated to him; it was then a sacrilegious profanation when they offered their sacrifices to idols. They were, indeed, already apostates; but such a sacrilege was not so notorious in their private superstitions as in the Temple; for this was to deprive God of his own honor. Though it was not right in them to abandon themselves to all kind of wickedness when they came forth from the Temple; yet the Temple itself ought to have continued, as it were, safe and free from every defilement. For this reason, therefore, he says that it was called by his <em>name, </em>and then that the Temple itself had been <em>defiled, </em>so that they did not spare his sacred name. The rest I shall defer till to-morrow. </p><p><strong>(74)</strong> The <em>Vulg. </em>and the <em>Targ. </em>very incorrectly render the words, “In which my name is called.” The <em>Sept. </em>and the <em>Syr. </em>are the same as our version. It was, no doubt, a house of prayer; but what is here meant is, that it was called God’s house. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
