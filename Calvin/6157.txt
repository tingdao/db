<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>This is the land, </em>etc The ancient boundaries long ago fixed by God, are recalled to remembrance, in order that Joshua. and the people may feel fully persuaded that the covenant made with Abraham would be fulfilled in every part. Wherefore they are enjoined to make it their study to acquire the parts still remaining to be possessed. The inference will be appropriate if we make a practical application of this perseverance to that which is required of us, viz., to forget the things which are behind, and reach forth unto those that are before, and press toward the mark for the prize of our high calling. (<span class="bvs">Phi_3:14</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(128)</span> For it would be of no use to run in the race without endeavoring to reach the goal. </p><p>The boundary commenced with a river separating Egypt toward the sea from the Holy Land, and most probably the river Nile, as we interpret it according to the received opinion, or a small stream which flowed past the town of Rhinocornea, believed by many to be Raphia or Raphane. <span class="cite-ref">(129)</span> It is indeed beyond dispute that the inheritance of the people commencing in that quarter was contiguous to Egypt. But although I have followed the opinion of the majority of expositors, that the boundaries were not extended further than to the less cultivated and in a manner desert land, lest greater proximity might have been injurious by leading to too close familiarity with the Egyptians, I by no means repudiate a different opinion. </p><p>The third verse raises a question. After it is said that the territories towards the sea-coast were five, a sixth is added, namely, that of the Avites. Some think that it is not counted among the five because it was an insignificant province. But I would have my readers to consider whether there may not be an indirect antithesis between a free people, their own masters, and five territories ruled by sovereigns. Hence the Avites being in different circumstances are mentioned separately, the plural number being used for the sake of distinction. In the enumeration of the sovereignties they are not arranged in the order of their dignity or opulence, but the first place is given to Aza because of its nearness to Egypt, and the same remark applies to Ashdod and the others. </p><p>The Septuagint translators, according to their usual custom, employ the Greek<span class="lang el-gr">γ </span><em>(gamma) to </em>express the Hebrew <span class="lang he-il">ע</span><em>(ain), </em>and thus give the name of Gaza to that which in Hebrew is Aza, in the same way as they convert Amorrha into Gomorrha. <span class="cite-ref">(130)</span> This sufficiently exposes the mistake of those who suppose that its name is Persian, and derived from its resources <span class="cite-ref">(131)</span> in consequence of Cambyses, when about to carry on war in Greece, having made it the depot of his treasures. But as in the Acts, (<span class="bvs">Act_8:26</span>,) Luke speaks of “Gaza which is desert,” it appears that a city of the same name was erected near it, but on a different site. Ashdod is the same as that which the Greeks called Azotus. The whole of this tract, which is either on the sea-coast or verging towards it, extends as far as Sidon. And there are some who think that the Phoenicians were once masters both of Gaza and Azotus. How far Lebanon extends is sufficiently known. <span class="cite-ref">(132)</span> For it sometimes comprehends Mount Hermon; and on account of its length part of it is surnamed Antilibanus. <span class="cite-ref">(133)</span> The reader will find the subject of Mount Hermon considered in <span class="bvs">Deu_4:0</span>. Towards the east is Hamath, which is also Antioch of Syria. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(128)</span> The original text had the reference to <span class="bvs">Phi_2:14</span>, an obvious typesetting error. —<em>fj. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(129)</span> The opinion generally entertained in Calvin’s time, that the river here meant was the Nile, or at least one of its branches, was founded partly on the meaning of the word <em>sihor</em>, which is literally <em>black</em>, and was explained by expositors as equivalent to <em>turbid</em>, a term strictly applicable to the Nile; and partly from a passage in Jeremiah, (<span class="bvs">Jer_2:18</span>) in which the Prophet asks, “What has thou to do in the way of Egypt to drink the waters of Sihor?” — Sihor being here undoubtedly used as a proper name for the Nile. The second opinion mentioned by Calvin is now almost universally admitted to be the only one tenable. Even the description here given of Sihor, (<span class="bvs">Jos_13:3</span>,) as “before Egypt,” is totally inapplicable to the Nile which, instead of being before Egypt, or on its frontiers, flows nearly through its center. The river meant and expressly referred to both by Moses (<span class="bvs">Num_34:5</span>) and by Joshua (<span class="bvs">Jos_15:4</span>) under the name of the river of Egypt, is now called the Wady El-Arisch, from the town of that name situated near its mouth, and not far from the site of the ancient Rhinocolura, or perhaps more properly Rhinocorura. Calvin spells Rhinocornea, which if it had not been repeated by the French, might seem to be a misprint. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(130)</span> It is here assumed that the only genuine sound represented by the Hebrew letter <em>Ain </em>is that of <em>a</em>. Is this the fact? Gesenius, on the contrary, while repudiating the modern Jewish pronunciation of it by the nasal <em>gn </em>or <em>ng </em>as decidedly false, says that its hardest sound is that of a <em>g </em>referring to Gaza and Gomorrha, the two words referred to by Calvin in illustration of the contrary. See Gesenius’s Hebrew Grammar. (Bagster, 1852.) </p><p><span class="cite-note">(131)</span> The French adds, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et qu’il signifie Richesses</span>;” “And that it means Riches.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(132)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quant au Liban, c’est une chose assez notoire quelle longeur d’etendue il a</span>;” “As to Lebanon it is sufficiently well known what length of extent it has.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(133)</span> This is certainly incorrect. Antilibanus received its name, not from its length, but from its being a mountain chain opposite and parallel to Libanus or Lebanon proper, from which it is separated by the beautiful valley known to the Greeks and Romans by the names of Coele-Syria, or rather Koile (Hollow) Syria, and watered by the Leontes. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
