<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>And they spake against God. The prophet had said that they tempted God in their heart; </em><span class="cite-ref">(327)</span> and now he adds, that they were not ashamed openly to utter with their impure and blasphemous tongues, the impiety which they had inwardly conceived. From this, it is the more abundantly manifest that malignity and wickedness had taken entire possession of their hearts. Thus we see how lust conceives sin, when it is admitted into the soul with unhallowed consent. Afterwards the sin develops itself farther, even as we see the Israelites proceeding to such a length of profane wantonness, as to call in question the power of God, as if they made no account of it, any farther than as it ministered to their lust. By the <em>table prepared </em>which is spoken of, is to be understood the dainty food, which was their ordinary fare in Egypt. A single dish did not satisfy their appetite. They were not contented unless they could gratify themselves with great abundance and variety. When it is said in the following verse, <em>Behold! God smote the rock, and the waters gushed out, etc</em>. , this, I have no doubt, is the language of bitter irony, with which the prophet taunts their unblushing insolence. It is not very likely that they spake in this manner; but he relates, as it were, with their mouth, or in their person, the things which took place before their eyes. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(327)</span> “‘They tempted God with their heart,’ that is, heartily, or with all their soul.” — <em>Walford</em>. </p></div></div>
