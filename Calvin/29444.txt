<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>I exhort Euodias and Syntyche </em>It is an almost universally received opinion that Paul was desirous to settle a quarrel, I know not of what sort, between those two women. While I am not inclined to contend as to this, the words of Paul do not afford ground enough for such a conjecture to satisfy us that it really was so. It appears, from the testimony which he gives in their favor, that they were very excellent women; for he assigns to them so much honor as to call them fellow-soldiers in the gospel <span class="cite-ref">(211)</span>. Hence, as their agreement was a matter of great moment <span class="cite-ref">(212)</span>, and, on the other hand, there would be great danger attendant on their disagreement, he stirs them up particularly to concord. </p><p>We must take notice, however, that, whenever he speaks of agreement, he adds also the bond of it—<em>in the Lord. </em>For every combination will inevitably be accursed, if apart from the Lord, and, on the other hand, nothing is so disjoined, but that it ought to be reunited in Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(211)</span><em>“ </em><em class="lang fr-fr">1l </em><span class="lang fr-fr">les appelle ses compagnes de guerre, d’autant qu’elles ont batail1e auec luy en l’euangile</span>;” — “He calls them his companions in war, inasmuch as they had struggled hard with him in the gospel.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(212)</span><em>“ </em><em class="lang fr-fr">C’estoit </em><span class="lang fr-fr">une chose grandement requise et necessaire qu’elles fussent d’un consentement</span>;” — “It was a thing greatly requisite and necessary that they should be in a state of agreement.” </p></div></div>
