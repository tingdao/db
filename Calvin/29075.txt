<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>Then after three years</em>. It was not till three years after he had begun to discharge the apostolic office, that he <em>went up to Jerusalem</em>. Thus, he did not, at the outset, receive the calling of men. But lest it should be supposed that he had separate interests from theirs, and was desirous to avoid their society, he tells us that he went up for the express purpose<em>to see </em><span class="cite-ref">(31)</span><em>Peter. </em><span class="cite-ref">(32)</span> Although he had not waited for their sanction before undertaking the office, yet it was not against their will, but with their full consent and approbation, that he held the rank of an apostle. He is desirous to shew that at no period was he at variance with the apostles, and that even now he is in full harmony with all their views. By mentioning the short time that he remained there, he shews that he had come, not with a view to learn, but solely for mutual intercourse. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(31)</span> “<span class="lang el-gr">̔ιστορεῖν</span> signifies either ‘to ascertain any <em>thing </em>by inquiry, or any <em>person </em>by personal examination;’ but sometimes, as here, to visit for the purpose of becoming acquainted with any one by personal communication.’ So Josephus, Bell. 6:1-8, <span class="lang el-gr">ὃν</span> (scil.
