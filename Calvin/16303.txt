<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Deliver me, O Jehovah! from my enemies</em>. This prayer is to the same effect, his enemies being so earnestly bent upon his destruction as to leave no outgate for him. The verb <span class="lang he-il">כסיתי</span>, <em>chisithi</em>, some render <em>to hope</em>: the proper meaning is <em>to cover</em>, and I am unwilling to depart from it. The explanation some give is, that David upon perceiving the imminent danger to which he was exposed, betook himself to the covert of God’s shadow, and concealed himself under the protection of it. This seems a very natural rendering, at least I prefer it to another which has recommended itself to some as being ingenious — that David, instead of having recourse to various quarters for relief, was satisfied to have God cognizant of his case, and called upon him in a hidden manner and apart. </p></div>
