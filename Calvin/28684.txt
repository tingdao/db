<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Now, brethren, if I should come. He </em>proposes himself as an example, because in his person the case was exhibited more strikingly <span class="cite-ref">(814)</span> The Corinthians experienced in themselves abundant fruit from his doctrine. He asks them, then, of what advantage it would be to them, if he were to make use of foreign languages among them. He shows them by this instance, how much better it were to apply their minds to prophesyings. Besides, it was less invidious to reprove this vice in his own person, than in that of another. </p><p>He mentions, however, four different kinds of edification — <em>revelation, knowledge, prophesying, </em>and <em>doctrine </em>As there are a variety of opinions among interpreters respecting them, let me be permitted, also, to bring forward my conjecture. As, however, it is but a conjecture, I leave my readers to judge of it. <em>Revelation </em>and <em>prophesying I </em>put in one class, and I am of opinion that the latter is the administration of the former. I am of the same opinion as to <em>knowledge </em>and <em>doctrine </em>What, therefore, any one has obtained by <em>revelation, </em>he dispenses by <em>prophesying. Doctrine </em>is the way of communicating knowledge. Thus a <em>Prophet </em>will be — one who interprets and administers <em>revelation. </em>This is rather in favor of the definition that I have given above, than at variance with it. For we have said that <em>prophesying </em>does not consist of a simple and bare interpretation of Scripture, but includes also <em>knowledge </em>for applying it to present use — which is obtained only by <em>revelation, </em>and the special inspiration of God. </p><p><strong>(814)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estoit plus propre pour leur imprimer ce qu’il dit</span>;” — “Was the more calculated to impress upon them what he says.” </p></div>
