<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Given them has God, etc. </em>There is no doubt, I think, but that the passage quoted here from Isaiah is that which Luke refers to in <span class="bvs">Act_28:26</span>, as quoted from him, only the words are somewhat altered. Nor does he record here what we find in the Prophet, but only collects from him this sentiment, — that they were imbued from above with the spirit of maliciousness, so that they continued dull in seeing and hearing. The Prophet was indeed bidden to harden the heart of the people: but Paul penetrates to the very fountain, — that brutal stupor seizes on all the senses of men, after they are given up to this madness, so that they excite themselves by virulent stimulants against the truth. For he does not call it the spirit of giddiness, but of compunction, when the bitterness of gall shows itself; yea, when there is also a fury in rejecting the truth. And he declares, that by the secret judgment of God the reprobate are so demented, that being stupified, they are incapable of forming a judgment; for when it is said, that by seeing they see nothing, the dullness of their senses is thereby intimated. <span class="cite-ref">(347)</span></p><p>Then Paul himself adds, <em>to this very day, </em>lest any one should object and say, that this prophecy had been formerly fulfilled, and that it was therefore absurd to apply it to the time of the gospel: this objection he anticipates, by subjoining, that it was not only a blindness of one day, which is <em>described, </em>but that it had continued, together with the unhealable obstinacy of the people, to the coming of Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(348)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(347)</span> The quotation in this verse is taken from two passages: the first clause is from <span class="bvs">Isa_29:10</span>, and the rest from <span class="bvs">Isa_6:9</span>, or <span class="bvs">Deu_29:4</span>. The first clause is not exactly according to the Hebrew or the <em>Septuagint</em>; instead of “God gave them,” etc., it is in the <em>Septuagint</em>, “the Lord hath made you drink,” etc., and in Hebrew, “Jehovah has poured upon you,” etc. It is the “spirit of slumber” in both, or rather, “of deep sleep” — <span class="lang he-il">תרדמה</span>, a dead or an overwhelming sleep; and<span class="lang el-gr">κατανύξις, </span> though not as to its primary sense the same, is yet used according to this meaning. The verb means to puncture, to prick, either with grief or remorse, and also to affect with stupor. The latter idea the noun must have in this place, for the Hebrew does not admit of the other. The latter part is found in substance, though not in the same form of words in the two places referred to. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(348)</span> Some consider this passage as taken from <span class="bvs">Deu_29:4</span>, and regard the last words as part of the quotation. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
