<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>The wine hath failed. </em>The same subject is continued, and the Prophet threatens chiefly against the Jews the desolation of the land. He gives a long description in order to affect them more deeply, and impress them with a conviction of the judgment of God. Their luxury, intemperance, and feasting, are rapidly surveyed, because amidst so great abundance they proudly disobeyed God. Such ingratitude was not peculiar to the Jews or to that age, but it is universally found that they who enjoy abundance rebel against God, and indulge themselves too freely. On this account the Prophet censures them; as if he had said, “Hitherto you have been plunged in luxuries and pleasures, but the Lord will cause you to lead a very different kind of life.” Isaiah speaks of the future as if it had been present, in order to place it more clearly before their eyes. </p></div>
