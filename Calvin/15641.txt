<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>He spake, and the grasshopper came </em>This calamity, which was brought upon the fields, could not be attributed to Fortune; for the grasshoppers made their appearance suddenly and in countless multitudes, so that they covered all the land of Egypt. The miracle was very evident from the word spoken, by which it was introduced. Its being announced as to happen, removed all doubt of its being the work of the Most High. Accordingly, it is expressly said, that grasshoppers and caterpillars rushed in at the commandment of God, as if soldiers should run to battle at the sound of the trumpet. Whenever these insects molest us and destroy the fruits of the earth, they are assuredly the scourges of God, but it is here intended to point out an extraordinary work of his hand. In fine, the prophet recites the last miracle, which was wrought by the angel on the night previous to the departure of the people, when he slew all the first-born throughout Egypt. I only take a hasty and passing glance at this history, as I have, in like manner, done of the other facts preceding, because they have been more copiously treated elsewhere, and at this time it is sufficient for us to know the design of the sacred writer. He, however, amplifies this display of the Divine power by a repetition, declaring that <em>the first-born and the flower of their strength were destroyed </em>Some translate, but unhappily, <em>The beginning of their sorrow. </em>As man’s strength shows itself in generation, the Hebrews term the first-begotten <em>the beginning of strength, </em>as we have explained on <span class="bvs">Gen_49:3</span>, — </p><p>“Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might,<LineBreak />and the beginning of my strength.” </p></div>
