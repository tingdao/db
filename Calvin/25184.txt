<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_6:37</span><strong>.</strong><em>Forgive, and it shall be forgiven to you. Give, and it shall be given to you. </em>This promise, which is added by Luke, means, that the Lord will cause him, who is indulgent, kind, and just to his brethren, to experience the same gentleness from others, and to be treated by them in a generous and friendly manner. Yet it frequently happens, that the children of God receive the very worst reward, and are oppressed by many unjust slanders; and that, to when they have injured no man’s reputation, and even spared the faults of brethren. But this is not inconsistent with what Christ says: for we know, that the promises which relate to the present life do not always hold, and are not without exceptions. Besides, though the Lord permits his people, when innocent, to be unjustly oppressed and almost overwhelmed, he fulfils what he says in another place, that “their uprightness shall break forth as the morning,” <span class="cite-ref">(464)</span> (<span class="bvs">Isa_58:8</span>.) In this way, his blessing always rises above all unjust slanders. He subjects believers to unjust reproaches, that he may humble them, and that he may at length maintain the goodness of their cause. It ought also to be taken into the account, that believers themselves, though they endeavor to act justly towards their brethren, are sometimes carried away by excessive severity against brethren, who were either innocent, or not so greatly to be blamed, and thus, by their own fault, provoke against themselves a similar judgment. If they do not receive g<em>ood measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, </em>though this is chargeable on the ingratitude of the world, yet they ought to acknowledge that it was partly deserved: for there is no man who is so kind and indulgent as he ought to be towards his brethren. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(464)</span> In the French version our Author quotes a similar passage from the book of Psalms, (<span class="bvs">Psa_37:6</span>;) “and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the <em>noon-day ” </em>—<em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
