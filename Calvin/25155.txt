<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_6:8</span><strong>.</strong><em>But he knew their thoughts </em>If Matthew states the truth, they had openly declared by their language what was in their minds; and therefore Christ replies not to <em>their secret thoughts, </em>but to express words. But both may be true, that they spoke plainly, and yet that Christ discerned their secret <em>thoughts</em>; for they did not openly avow their designs, and Matthew himself tells us that their question was intended to take Christ by surprise; and, consequently, Luke means nothing more than that Christ was aware of their insidious designs, though not expressed in words. </p></div>
