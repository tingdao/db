<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>They shall look to him, and shall flow to him. </em>I have already intimated, that this verse and the following should be read in connection with the preceding verse. In relating his own experience David has furnished an example to others, that they should freely and without fear approach God in order to present their prayers before him. Now, he says that they shall come, and this too with a happy issue. The first two verbs are expressed in the past time in the Hebrew; but I have, notwithstanding, no doubt that the sentence ought to be explained thus: When they shall have looked to him, and flowed to him, their faces shall not be ashamed. I have therefore translated them in the future tense. David is not relating things which had happened, but is commending the fruit of the favor which had been manifested to himself. Some interpreters, I know, refer the words <em>to him </em>to David, <span class="cite-ref">(691)</span> because immediately after he speaks of himself in the third person. Others with greater propriety explain it; of God himself. A difference of opinion also exists as to the Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">נהרו</span><em>, naharu, </em>which some, supposing it to be derived from the root <span class="lang he-il">אור</span>, <em>or, </em>render <em>to be enlightened. </em><span class="cite-ref">(692)</span> But, in my opinion, the natural signification of the word appears very appropriate to this place; as if he had said, There shall now be a mirror set forth, in which men may behold the face of God serene and merciful; and therefore the poor and afflicted shall henceforth dare to lift up their eyes to God, and to resort to him with the utmost freedom, because no uncertainty shall any longer retard them or render them slothful. If, however, any one should prefer the word <em>enlighten, </em>the meaning will be, They who formerly languished in darkness shall lift up their eyes to God, as if a light had suddenly appeared unto them, and they who were cast down and overwhelmed with shame, shall again clothe their countenances with cheerfulness. But as the meaning in either case is substantially the same, I am not much disposed to contend which of the two interpretations ought to be preferred. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(691)</span> Those who take this view explain the words as meaning that the humble or afflicted, upon looking to David, saw how graciously God had dealt with him, and were enlightened, revived, and encouraged. They also consider, as Calvin himself does, the humble or afflicted as the persons who speak in the sixth verse, where, pointing as it were with the finger to David, they say, “This poor man cried,” etc. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(692)</span> This is the rendering adopted by <em>Horsley</em>, who understands by the expression the illumination of the soul by the light of Divine truth. He reads the verb in the imperative mood, and his translation of the entire verse is as follows: </p><p>“Look towards him, and thou shalt be enlightened; <LineBreak />And your faces shall never be ashamed.” </p><p>This reading is sanctioned by the Septuagint. It supposes two alterations on the text. First, that instead of <span class="lang he-il">הביטו</span><em>, they looked, </em>we should read <span class="lang he-il">הביטו</span>, <em>habitu, look ye; </em>and this last reading is supported by several of <em>Dr Kennicott’s </em>and <em>De Rossi’s </em>MSS. The other alteration is, that instead of <span class="lang he-il">ופניהש</span><em>, upeneyhem, their faces, </em>we should read <span class="lang he-il">ופניכש</span><em>, upeneykem, your faces. Poole</em>, in defense of reading <em>your </em>instead of <em>their, </em>observes, “that the change of persons is very frequent in this book.” </p></div></div>
