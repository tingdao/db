<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>But some doubted. </em>It is wonderful that, after they had twice seen Christ, still <em>some doubted. </em>If any one choose to view this as referring to the first appearance, there will be no absurdity in that opinion; for the Evangelists are sometimes in the habit of blending a variety of transactions. But neither would it have the appearance of absurdity to suppose that in some of them the remains of their former terror led them again into hesitation; for we know that, when Christ appeared, they were struck with fear and amazement, till they had recovered their minds and had become accustomed to his presence. The meaning, therefor appears to me to be, that <em>some </em>at first hesitated, until Christ made a nearer and more familiar approach to them; but that when they certainly and absolutely recognized him, then <em>they worshipped, </em>because the splendor of his divine glory was manifest. And perhaps it was the same reason that suddenly caused them to <em>doubt, </em>and afterwards led them to <em>worship him; </em>namely, that he had laid aside the form of a servant, and had nothing in his appearance but what was heavenly. </p></div>
