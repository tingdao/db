Christ says that those are <em>happy, </em>who are not only prepared to endure their own afflictions, but to take a share in the afflictions of others, — who assist the wretched, — who willingly take part with those who are in distress, — who clothe themselves, as it were, with the same affections, that they may be more readily disposed to render them assistance. He adds, <em>for they shall obtain mercy, </em>— not only with God, but also among men, whose minds God will dispose to the exercise of humanity. <span class="cite-ref">(368)</span> Though the whole world may sometimes be ungrateful, and may return the very worst reward to those who have done acts of kindness to them, it ought to be reckoned enough, that grace is laid up with God for the merciful and humane, so that they, in their turn, will find him to be <em>gracious and merciful, </em>(<span class="bvs">Psa_103:8</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(367)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceci aussi est un paradoxe, c'est a dire, une sentence contraire au jugement commun des hommes</span>.” — “This also is a paradox, that is to say, a sentiment contrary to the general opinion of men.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(368)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A douceur et compassion</span>;” — “to mildness and compass </p></div></div>
