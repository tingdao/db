<div class="comment-content"><p>He still addresses the Medes and the Persians, and bids them <em>cut </em>off from <em>Babylon </em>both the <em>sowers </em>and the <em>reapers; </em>but by stating a part for the whole he includes also all others. Husbandmen in a manner preserve the life of men, as other arts and occupations are not capable of doing so. Were there no sowing and reaping, all would of necessity perish. When, therefore, the Prophet bids them take away those who sowed and reaped, it was the same as though he had said, <em>“ </em>Strike with the sword and kill all the inhabitants, so that nothing may remain but the land reduced to solitude.” He then commands the Chaldeans to be slain, so that no husbandmen should remain to sow and reap. </p><p>This, indeed, was not fulfilled by Cyrus, as we have elsewhere seen.
