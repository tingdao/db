<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_24:37</span><strong>.</strong><em>But as the days of Noah were. </em>Although Christ lately expressed his desire to keep the minds of his followers in suspense, that they might not inquire too anxiously about the last day; yet, lest the indifference arising out of the enjoyments of the world should lull them to sleep, he now exhorts them to solicitude. He wished them to be uncertain as to his coming, but yet to be prepared to expect him every day, or rather every moment. <span class="cite-ref">(163)</span> To shake off their sloth, and to excite them more powerfully to be on their guard, he foretells that the end will come, while the world is sunk in brutal indifference; just as <em>in the days of Noah </em>all the nations were swallowed up by <em>the deluge, </em>when they had no expectation of it, but rioted in gluttony and voluptuousness, and shortly afterwards, the inhabitants of <em>Sodom, </em>while they were abandoning themselves without fear to sensuality, were consumed by fire from heaven. Since indifference of this sort will exist about the time of the last day, believers ought not to indulge themselves after the example of the multitude. </p><p>We have now ascertained the design of Christ, which was, to inform believers that, in order to prevent themselves from being suddenly overtaken, they ought always to keep watch, because the day of the last judgment will come when it is not expected. Luke alone mentions <em>Sodom, </em>and that in the seventeenth chapter, where he takes occasion, without attending to the order of time, to relate this discourse of Christ. But it would not have been improper that the two Evangelists should have satisfied themselves with a single example, though Christ mentioned two, more especially when those examples perfectly agreed with each other in this respect, that at one time the whole human race, in the midst of unbroken indolence and pleasure, was suddenly swallowed up, <span class="cite-ref">(164)</span> with the exception of a few individuals. When he says that men were giving their whole attention to <em>eating, drinking, marriage, </em>and other worldly employments, at the time when God destroyed the whole world by <em>a deluge, </em>and <em>Sodom </em>by thunder; these words mean that they were as fully occupied with the conveniences and enjoyments of the present life, as if there had been no reason to dread any change. And though we shall immediately find him commanding the disciples to guard against <em>surfeiting </em>and earthly cares, yet in this passage he does not directly condemn the intemperance, but rather the obstinacy, of those times, in consequence of which, they despised the threatenings of God, and awaited with indifference their awful destruction. Promising to themselves that the condition in which they then were would remain unchanged, they did not scruple to follow without concern their ordinary pursuits. And in itself it would not have been improper, or worthy of condemnation, to make provision for their wants, if they had not with gross stupidity opposed the judgment of God, and rushed, with closed eyes, to unbridled iniquity, as if there had been no Judge in heaven. So now Christ declares that the last age of the world will be in a state of stupid indifference, so that men will think of nothing but the present life, and will extend their cares to a long period, pursuing their ordinary course of life, as if the world were always to remain in the same condition. The comparisons are highly appropriate; for if we consider what then happened, we shall no longer be deceived by the belief that the uniform order of events which we see in the world will always continue. For within three days of the time, when every man was conducting his affairs in the utmost tranquillity, the world was swallowed up by a deluge, and five cities were consumed by fire. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(163)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De jour en jour, ou plustost d’heure en heure</span>;” — “from day to day, or rather from hour to hour.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(164)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Avoit esté soudainement destruit par les eaux</span>;” — “was suddenly destroyed by the waters.” </p></div></div>
