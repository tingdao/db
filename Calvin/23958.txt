<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>For I tell you. </em>He confirms what he had said about the approaching vengeance of God, by saying that the only method of avoiding destruction will be taken from them. For that was <em>the accepted time, the day of salvation, </em>(<span class="bvs">Isa_49:8</span>; <span class="bvs">2Co_6:2</span>,) so long as that very person who had come to be their Redeemer, attested and proclaimed the redemption which he had brought. But at his departure, as at the setting of the sun, the light of life vanished; and therefore this dreadful calamity, which he threatens, must of necessity fall upon them. </p><p><em>Until you say. </em>We come now to inquire what period is denoted by this phrase. Some restrict it to the last day of judgment. Others think that it is a prediction, which was soon afterwards fulfilled, when some of the Jews humbly adored Christ. But I do not approve of either of these interpretations. And I am certainly astonished that learned men should have stumbled at so small an obstacle, by taking great pains to inquire how unbelievers can say concerning Christ, <em>Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord; </em>for he does not declare what they will be, but what he himself will do. And even the adverb <em>until </em>extends no farther than to the time which goes before. Joseph did not know his wife <em>until </em>she brought forth Christ, (<span class="bvs">Mat_1:25</span>.) By these words Scripture does not mean, that after Christ had been born they lived together as husband and wife, but only shows that Mary, before the birth of her son, was a virgin that had not known man. </p><p>So then the true meaning of the present passage, in nay opinion, is this: <em>“Hitherto </em>I have lived among you in humility and kindness, and have discharged the office of a teacher; and no having finished the course of my calling, I shall depart, and it will not be possible for you any longer to enjoy my presence, but him whom you now despise as a Redeemer and a minister of salvation, you will find to be your Judge.” In this manner the passage agrees with the words of Zechariah, <em>They shall look on him whom they pierced, </em>(<span class="bvs">Zec_12:10</span>; <span class="bvs">Joh_19:37</span>.) But Christ appears also to make an indirect allusion to their vain hypocrisy, because, as if they ardently longed for the promised salvation, they sung daily the words of the psalm, </p><p>Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_118:26</span>;) </p><p>while they treated with scorn the Redeemer that was offered to them. In short, he declares that he will not come to them <em>until, </em>trembling at the sight of his dreadful majesty, they shall exclaim—when it is too late—that truly he is the Son of God. And this threatening is addressed to all despisers of the Gospel, more especially to those who falsely profess his name, while they reject his doctrine; for they will one day acknowledge that they cannot escape the hands of him whom they now mock by their hypocritical pretensions. For the same song is now sung by the Papists, who, after all, care nothing about Christ, <em>until, </em>armed with vengeance, he ascends his tribunal. We are also reminded, that so long as Christ exhibits himself to us in the name of the Father as the herald of salvation and Mediator, we ought not only to honor him with our lips, but sincerely to wish that he would make us and the whole world subject to himself. </p></div>
