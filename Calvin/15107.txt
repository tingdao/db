<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Thy ways, O God! are in the sanctuary. </em>Some translate <em>in holiness, </em>and they are led to do this, because it seems to them a cold and meagre form of expression to say, that <em>God’s ways are in his sanctuary </em>But as the rules of grammar will not easily admit of this, we must inquire whether a profitable truth may not be drawn from the term <em>sanctuary, </em>which is the proper signification of the original word <span class="lang he-il">בקדש</span>, <em>bakkodesh. </em>Some are of opinion that this is an abrupt exclamation, as if it had been said, <em>O God, who art in the sanctuary! O thy ways! </em>but of this I do not approve; for they do violence to the words of the prophet. The clause should be read in one connected sentence, and the word <em>sanctuary </em>is to be taken either for heaven or for the temple. I am rather inclined to refer it to heaven, conceiving the meaning to be, that the ways of God rise high above the world, so that if we are truly desirous to know them, we must ascend above all heavens. Although the works of God are in part manifest to us, yet all our knowledge of them comes far short of their immeasurable height. Besides, it is to be observed, that none enjoy the least taste of his works but those who by faith rise up to heaven. And yet, the utmost point to which we can ever attain is, to contemplate with admiration and reverence the hidden wisdom and power of God, which, while they shine forth in his works, yet far surpass the limited powers of our understanding. If it is objected, that it is wrong to attempt to confine to heaven the ways of God, which are extended through the whole world, the answer is easy; for although there is not a single corner of the globe in which God does not exhibit some proof of his power and operation, yet the wonderful character of his works escapes the eyes of men. If any would rather understand <em>sanctuary </em>as meaning the temple, it may be noticed, that we have met with an almost similar sentence in <span class="bvs">Psa_73:16</span>, </p><p><em>“When </em>I thought to know this, it was too painful for me, <LineBreak />until I went into the sanctuary of God.” </p><p>The temple, indeed, in which God manifested himself was, as it were, a heaven on earth. <span class="cite-ref">(300)</span> It is now obvious that the meaning of the inspired writer is, that as at the commencement he had uttered distressing complaints, so now, having attained to a calm and settled state of mind, he admires and adores the high ways of God, and conscious of his own weakness, quietly and modestly keeps himself within the bounds prescribed to him, not permitting himself to judge or pass sentence upon the secret judgments of God according to the dictates of his carnal understanding. He therefore immediately after exclaims, <em>Who is so great a God as our God? </em>By this comparison, he does not mean that there are many gods, but he indirectly rebukes the deep infatuation of the world who, not contented with the only true God whose glory is so conspicuous, invent for themselves many gods. If men would look upon the works of God with pure eyes, they would be led without much difficulty to rest with satisfaction in him alone. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(300)</span> “<em>Thy way</em>, <em>O God </em>!<em>is in the sanctuary</em>; the temple, the Church of God, where he takes his walks and manifests himself, and where the reasons of his providence and dealings with his people are opened and made known unto them.” — <em>Dr Gill</em>. </p></div></div>
