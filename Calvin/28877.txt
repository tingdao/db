<div class="comment-content"><p><em>While we look not. </em>Mark what it is, that will make all the miseries of this world easy to be endured, — if we carry forward our thoughts to the eternity of the heavenly kingdom. For a moment is long, if we look around us on this side and on that; but, when we have once raised our minds heavenward, a thousand years begin to appear to us to be like a moment. Farther, the Apostle’s words intimate, that we are imposed upon by the view of present things, because there is nothing there that is not <em>temporal; </em>and that, consequently, there is nothing for us to rest upon but confidence in a future life. Observe the expression, <em>looking at the things which are unseen, </em><span class="cite-ref">(504)</span> for the eye of faith penetrates beyond all our natural senses, and faith is also on that account represented as a <em>looking at things that are invisible. </em>(<span class="bvs">Heb_11:1</span>.) </p><p><strong>(504)</strong> “The word which is here rendered <em>look </em>signifies <em>to take aim at</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">σκοποῦντων ἡμῶν</span>) This is a very steady intuition, which a man hath of the mark which he is aiming at, or the end which he designs; he must always have it in his eye. And by this looking, saith the Apostle, we find that, notwithstanding all the decays of the <em>outward man, the inward man is reviewed day by day </em>— life, and vigor, and spirit continually entering in at our eyes from that glorious aim which we have before us. This will need a very steady determination of mind unto such objects by a commanding light and glory that they carry with them, so that the soul feels not a disposition in itself to direct or look off.” — <em>Howe’s Works</em>, (Lond. 1834,) p. 543. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
