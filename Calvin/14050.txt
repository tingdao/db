<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>He will sit in the ensnaring places of the villages. </em><span class="cite-ref">(217)</span> I have purposely avoided changing the verbs of the future tense into another tense, because they imply a continued act, and also because this Hebrew idiom has extended even to other languages. David, therefore, describes what ungodly men are accustomed to do. And, in the first place, he compares them to highwaymen, who lie in wait at the narrow parts of roads, and choose for themselves hiding-places from which they may fall upon travelers when off their guard. He says also, that <em>their eyes are bent or leering, </em><span class="cite-ref">(218)</span> by a similitude borrowed from the practice of dart-shooters, who take their aim with leering, or half shut eyes, in order to hit the mark the surer. Nor does he here speak of the common sort of highwaymen who are in the woods; <span class="cite-ref">(219)</span> but he directs his language against those great robbers who hide their wickedness under titles of honor, and pomp, and splendor. The word <span class="lang he-il">חצרים</span>,<em>chatserim, </em>therefore, which we have rendered <em>villages, </em>is by some translated palaces; as if David had said, they have converted their royal mansions into places of robbery, where they may cut the throats of their unhappy victims. But granting the word to have this allusion, I consider that it refers principally to the practice of robbers, to which there is a reference in the whole verse, and I explain it thus: Like as robbers lie in wait at the egresses of villages, so these persons lay their snares wherever they are. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(217)</span><em>Horsley </em>renders the eighth verse thus: </p><p>“He sitteth in ambush* in the villages in secret places; <LineBreak />He murdereth the innocent; <LineBreak />his eyes are ever watching for the helpless.” </p><p>And he has the following note: ”<em>Symmachus </em>and <em>St Jerome </em>certainly read thus <span class="lang he-il">ישכ מארב בחצרים</span>, and they both render, <span class="lang he-il">ה</span>, as a participle. ‘He sitteth prowling about the farm-houses.’ This I take to be the true reading and the true rendering. The image is that of a beast of prey of the lesser order, a fox or a wolf, lying upon the watch about the farm-yard in the evening.” </p><p>*Or, “he sitteth prowling about the farmyard.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(218)</span><em>Bishop Mant </em>reads “peering eyes.” Concerning the word, says he, “which I have rendered <em>peering, Parkhurst </em>says that it is applied to winking or half closing the eyes in order to see more distinctly. The Septuagint and Vulgate translations, which mean <em>look at, behold, </em>give the general sense, but not the beautiful image expressed in the Hebrew.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(219)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui sont parmi les bois</span>.” — <em>Fr </em></p></div></div>
