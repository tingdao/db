<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>I had written to you. </em>As he had said a little before, that he delayed coming to them, in order that he <em>might not come a second time in sorrow </em>and with severity, (<span class="bvs">2Co_2:1</span>,) so now also he lets them know, that he came the first time in sadness by an Epistle, that they might not have occasion to feel this severity when he was present with them. Hence they have no ground to complain of that former sadness, in which he was desirous to consult their welfare. He goes even a step farther, by stating that, when writing, he did not wish to occasion them grief, or to give any expression of displeasure, but, on the contrary, to give proof of his attachment and affection towards them. In this way, if there was any degree of keenness in the Epistle, he does not merely soften it, but even shows amiableness and suavity. When, however, he confesses afterwards, what he here denies, he appears to contradict himself. I answer, that there is no inconsistency, for he does not come afterwards to confess, that it was his ultimate object to <em>grieve </em>the Corinthians, but that this was the means, by which he endeavored to conduct them to true joy. Previously, however, to his stating this, he speaks here simply as to his design. He passes over in silence, or delays mentioning for a little the means, which were not so agreeable. </p><p><em>Having confidence </em>This confidence he exercises towards the Corinthians, that they may thus in their turn be persuaded of his friendly disposition. For he that hates, is envious; but where joy is felt in common, there must in that case be perfect love. <span class="cite-ref">(315)</span> If, however, the Corinthians are not in accordance with Paul’s opinion and judgment as to them, they shamefully disappoint him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(315)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il faut bien dire que l’amitie y est entiere</span>;” — “We cannot but say that there is entire friendship.” </p></div></div>
