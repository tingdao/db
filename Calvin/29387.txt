<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26</strong><em>That your glorying</em>. The expression which he employs, <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν ἐμόι</span>, I have rendered <em>de me </em><em>(as to me,) </em>because the preposition is made use of twice, but in different senses. No one assuredly will deny that I have faithfully brought out Paul’s mind. The rendering given by some — <em>per Christum </em><em>, (through Christ,) </em>I do not approve of. For <em>in Christ </em>is employed in place of <em>Secundum Christum </em><em>, (According to Christ,) </em>or <em>Christiane </em><em>, (Christianly,) </em>to intimate that it was a holy kind of <em>glorying</em>. For otherwise we are commanded to <em>glory in God alone</em>. (<span class="bvs">1Co_1:31</span>.) Hence malevolent persons might meet Paul with the objection, How is it allowable for the Philippians to glory as to thee? He anticipates this calumny by saying that they will do this <em>according to Christ </em>— glorying in a servant of Christ, with a view to the glory of his Lord, and that with an eye to the doctrine rather than to the individual, and in opposition to the false apostles, just as David, by comparing himself with hypocrites, boasts of his righteousness. (<span class="bvs">Psa_7:8</span>.) </p></div>
