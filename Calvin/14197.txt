<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>His glory is great. </em>By these words the people intimate that their king, through the protection which God afforded him, and the deliverances which he wrought for him, would become more renowned than if he had reigned in peace with the applause of all men, or had been defended by human wealth and human strength, or, finally, had continued invincible by his own power and policy; for thereby it appeared the more clearly that he had only attained to the royal dignity by the favor, conduct, and commandment of God. The believing Israelites, therefore, leave it to heathen kings to ennoble themselves by their own achievements, and to acquire fame by their own valor; and they set more value upon this, that God graciously showed himself favorable towards their king, <span class="cite-ref">(483)</span> than upon all the triumphs of the world. At the same time, they promise themselves such assistance from God as will suffice for adorning the king with majesty and honor. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(483)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que la grace de Dieu se monstre favorable envers leur Roy</span>.” — Fr. </p></div></div>
