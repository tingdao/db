<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>Sing unto Jehovah a new song </em>This commencement shows that, as I have already observed, the Psalmist is exhorting the whole world, and not the Israelites merely, to the exercise of devotion. Nor could this be done, unless the gospel were universally diffused as the means of conveying the knowledge of God. The saying of Paul must necessarily hold true, </p><p>“How shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed?” (<span class="bvs">Rom_10:14</span>.) </p><p>The same Apostle proves the calling of the Gentiles, by adducing in testimony of it, “Praise the Lord, ye Gentiles, with his people” — from which it follows, that fellowship in the faith stands connected with the joint celebration of praise, (<span class="bvs">Rom_15:11</span>.) Besides, the Psalmist requires a <em>new song, </em><span class="cite-ref">(75)</span> not one which was common, and had formerly been raised. He must therefore refer to some unusual and extraordinary display of the Divine goodness. Thus, when Isaiah speaks of the restoration of the Church, which was wonderful and incredible, he says, “Sing unto the Lord a new song,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_42:10</span>.) The Psalmist intimates accordingly, that the time was come when God would erect his kingdom in the world in a manner altogether unlooked for. He intimates still more clearly as he proceeds, that all nations would share in the favor of God. He calls upon them everywhere to show forth his salvation, and, in desiring that they should celebrate it from day to day, would denote that it was not of a fading or evanescent nature, but such as should endure for ever. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(75)</span> We meet with a psalm very similar to this, in <span class="bvs">1Ch_16:0</span>, delivered by David to Asaph, to be sung on occasion of the removing of the ark from the house of Obed-edom to Zion. But the ode, as it stands in <span class="bvs">1Ch_16:0</span>, is considerably longer, extending from the 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse to the 36<span class="cite-ref">th</span> [<span class="bvs">1Ch_16:8</span> ]; and this is only the part of it from the 23<span class="cite-ref">rd</span> to the 33<span class="cite-ref">rd</span> verse [<span class="bvs">1Ch_16:23</span> ]. It has been supposed that this part was extracted from the psalm above mentioned, and, with a few inconsiderable alterations, adapted to the solemnity of the dedication of the second temple. This opinion is founded upon the inscription of the psalm in the Septuagint, Vulgate, Æthiopic, and Arabic versions, which is, “A song of David when the house was built after the captivity.” Consequently, strictly speaking, this is not a <em>new song</em>. But it may be called <em>new</em>, from its having been adapted to a new purpose — from its having been intended to celebrate new mercies conferred upon the Jews, and to lead the mind forward to the glorious era of the coming of the Messiah, and the establishment of his kingdom, which probably was the matter of more general expectation among the chosen people, at the period when the temple was rebuilt, than when the ark was brought to Mount Zion from the house of Obed-edom. It may be observed, that the first verse is not in the original poem, as recorded in the book of Chronicles, but appears to have been added for the new occasion to which this shorter psalm was adapted. </p></div></div>
