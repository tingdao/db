<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And this is the Law of the meat-offering. </em>We have already seen that there were various kinds of this offering; now, the cakes or wafers are omitted, <span class="cite-ref">(279)</span> and mention is only made of uncooked flour, whereof God commands that the priest should burn on the altar as much as his hand could hold. But this law was necessary in order that believers might be fully assured that God was propitiated by the due offering of this part, and that none might complain because the greater portion remained with the priests. Lest, however, the dignity of the sacrifice should be impaired, it was only permitted to the priests to make unleavened bread of it, which they were to eat in the sanctuary, as we have seen elsewhere. The meat-offering of the priests is excepted, which I conceive to be for two reasons, — first, that the excellency and dignity of their gift, honored as it was by special privilege, might stimulate the priests to greater efforts of piety, so as not to exercise themselves in God’s service in a common and perfunctory manner; secondly, that they might be thus restrained from the affectation of offering it too frequently.

Lest, therefore, they should cause their immoderate oblations to minister both to their vainglory and avarice, God willed that their meat-offering should be entirely consumed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(279)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Omettant les gasteux, et les tourtes, et bignets, tant cuits au four que frits</span>;” omitting the cakes, and the tarts, and fritters, both cooked in the oven and fried. — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(280)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Leurs belles parades</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
