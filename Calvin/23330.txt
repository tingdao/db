<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Enter in by the strait gate </em>As nothing is more opposed to the flesh than the doctrine of Christ, no man will ever make great proficiency in it who has not learned to confine his senses and feelings, so as to keep them within those boundaries, which our heavenly Teacher prescribes for curbing our wantonness. As men willingly flatter themselves, and live in gaiety and dissipation, Christ here reminds his disciples, that they must prepare to walk, as it were, along a <em>narrow </em>and thorny <em>road </em>But as it is difficult to restrain our desires from wicked licentiousness and disorder, he soothes this bitterness by a joyful remuneration, when he tells us, that <em>the narrow gate, and the narrow road, lead to life </em>Lest we should be captivated, on the other hand, by the allurements of a licentious and dissolute life, and wander as the lust of the flesh draws us, <span class="cite-ref">(469)</span> he declares that they rush headlong to death, who choose to walk along <em>the broad road, and through the wide gate, </em>instead of keeping by <em>the strait gate, and narrow way, which lead to life </em></p><p>He expressly says, that <em>many </em>run along the <em>broad road: </em>because men ruin each other by wicked examples. <span class="cite-ref">(470)</span> For whence does it arise, that each of them knowingly and wilfully rushes headlong, but because, while they are ruined in the midst of a vast crowd, they do not believe that they are ruined? The small number of believers, on the other hand, renders many persons careless. It is with difficulty that we are brought to renounce the world, and to regulate ourselves and our life by the manners of a <em>few</em>. We think it strange that we should be forcibly separated from the vast majority, as if we were not a part of the human race. But though the doctrine of Christ confines and hems us in, reduces our life to a <em>narrow road, </em>separates us from the crowd, and unites us to a <em>few </em>companions, yet this harshness ought not to prevent us from striving to obtain life. </p><p>It is sufficiently evident from Luke’s Gospel, that the instruction, which we are now considering, was uttered by Christ at a different time from that on which he delivered the paradoxes, <span class="cite-ref">(471)</span> which we have formerly examined, about a <em>happy </em>life, (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:3</span>,) and laid down to them the rule of prayer. And this is what I have repeatedly hinted, that the instructions which are related by the other Evangelists, at different times, according to the order of the history, were here collected by Matthew into one summary, that he might bring more fully under our view the manner in which Christ taught his disciples. I have therefore thought it best to introduce here the whole passage from Luke, which corresponds to this sentence. While I have been careful to inform my readers, as to the order of time which is observed by Luke, they will forgive me, I hope, for not being more exact <span class="cite-ref">(472)</span> than Matthew in the arrangement of the doctrine. </p><p><strong>(469)</strong> (“<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme facilement les appetits de la chair nous tirent en leurs filets</span>;”) —(“as the appetites of the flesh easily draw us into their nets.”) </p><p><strong>(470)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource que les hommes se poussent les uns les autres au chemin de damnation par mauvais exemple</span>;” — “because men urge each other on in the road to damnation by bad example.” </p><p><strong>(471)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand il a prononce ces sentences que nous avons veues par ci de-vant, monstrant tout au contraire de l’opinion commune</span>;” — “when he pronounced those sentences which we have formerly seen, showing it to be altogether contrary to the common opinion.” </p><p><strong>(472)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si je n'ay pas este plus scrupuleux ou curieux en conferant les passages tendans a un mesme poinct de doctrine</span>;” — “if I have not been more careful or exact in comparing the passages relating to the same point of doctrine.” </p></div>
