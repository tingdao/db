<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Now it is no more I who do it</em>, <em>etc. </em>This is not the pleading of one excusing himself, as though he was blameless, as the case is with many triflers who think that they have a sufficient defense to cover all their wickedness, when they cast the blame on the flesh; but it is a declaration, by which he shows how very far he dissented from his own flesh in his spiritual feeling; for the faithful are carried along in their obedience to God with such fervour of spirit that they deny the flesh. </p><p>This passage also clearly shows, that Paul speaks here of none but of the godly, who have been already born again; for as long as man remains like himself, whatsoever he may be, he is justly deemed corrupt; but Paul here denies that he is wholly possessed by sin; nay, he declares himself to be exempt from its bondage, as though he had said, that sin only dwelt in some part of his soul, while with an earnest feeling of heart he strove for and aspired after the righteousness of God, and clearly proved that he had the law of God engraven within him. <span class="cite-ref">(225)</span></p><p><strong>(225)</strong> The last clause of this verse is worthy of notice, as the expression “indwelling sin” seems to have arisen from the words<span class="lang el-gr">ἡ οἰκουσα ἐν ἐμοὶ </span> — “which dwells in me.” Sin was in him as in a house or dwelling; it was an in-habiting sin, or that which is in-abiding or resident. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
