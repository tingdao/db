<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>Nay, father Abraham. </em>This is a personification, as we have said, which expresses rather the feelings of the living than the anxiety of the dead. The doctrine of the <em>Law </em>is little esteemed by the world, the <em>Prophets </em>are neglected, and no man submits to hear God speaking in his own manner. Some would desire that angels should descend from heaven; others, that the dead should come out of their graves; others, that new miracles should be performed every day to sanction what they hear; and others, that voices should be heard from the sky. <span class="cite-ref">(312)</span> But if God were pleased to comply with all their foolish wishes, it would be of no advantage to them; for God has included in his word all that is necessary to be known, and the authority of this word has been attested and proved by authentic seals. Besides, faith does not depend on miracles, or any extraordinary sign, but is the peculiar gift of the Spirit, and is produced by means of the word. Lastly, it is the prerogative of God to draw us to himself, and he is pleased to work effectually through his own word. There is not the slightest reason, therefore, to expect that those means, which withdraw us from obedience to the word, will be of any service to us. I freely acknowledge, that there is nothing to which the flesh is more strongly inclined than to listen to vain revelations; and we see how eagerly those men, to whom the whole of Scripture is an object of dislike, throw themselves into the snares of Satan. Hence have arisen necromancy and other delusions, which the world not only receives with avidity, but runs after with furious rage. But all that is here affirmed by Christ is, that even the dead could not reform, <span class="cite-ref">(313)</span> or bring to a sound mind, those who are deaf and obstinate against the instructions of the law. </p><p><strong>(312)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les autres, que Dieu parlast a eux du ciel en personne</span>;”— “others, that God would speak to them from heaven in person.” </p><p><strong>(313)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne s’amenderont point, mesmes quand les morts viendroyent parler a eux, et les advertir</span>;” — “will not reform, even though the dead should come to talk to them and warn them.” </p></div>
