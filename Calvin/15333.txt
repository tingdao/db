<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>For who in the clouds can be compared to Jehovah? </em>The prophet now proceeds to illustrate farther what he had said respecting Godâ€™s wonders, and exclaims emphatically, <em>Who in the clouds can be compared to God? </em>The reason why he speaks of <em>the clouds, </em>or <em>heaven, </em>is because, what is not surprising, nothing is to be found upon the earth which can at all approach the glory of God. Although man excels other living creatures, yet we see how contemptible and miserable his condition is, or rather, how full it is of shame and reproach. Whence it follows, that under heaven there is no excellence which can compete with that of God. But when we ascend to heaven, immediately ravished with admiration, we conceive of a multitude of gods, which do away with the true God. The last clause of the verse, in which it is said, <em>that among the sons of the gods there is none like the true and only God, </em>is an explanation of the first. The opinion of some, that by <em>the clouds, </em>or <em>the heavens, </em>is to be understood the sun, moon, and stars, is disproved by the context itself. The amount then is, that even in the heavens, God alone has the entire pre-eminence, having there none as a companion or equal. The appellation <em>the sons of the gods </em>is here given to angels, because they neither have their origin from the earth, nor are clothed with a corruptible body, but are celestial spirits, adorned with a Divine glory. It is not meant that they are a part of the Divine essence or substance, as some fanatics dream; but as God displays his power in them, this title is attributed to them, to distinguish between their nature and ours. In short, although a greater majesty shines forth in the angels than in other creatures, at the contemplation of which we are ravished with admiration, yet come they not near God, so as to obscure and impair his glory by their excellence, or to share with him in the sovereignty of the universe. This is a point worthy of our careful attention; for, although God everywhere declares in his word that the angels are only his servants, and always ready to execute his commands, yet the world, not contented with having only one God, forges for itself a countless number of deities. </p></div>
