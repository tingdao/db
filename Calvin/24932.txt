<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>Behold the handmaid of the Lord </em>The holy virgin does not allow herself to dispute any farther: and yet many things might unquestionably have obtruded themselves, to repress that faith, and even to draw off her attention from what was said to her by the angel. But she stops the entrance of opposing arguments, and compels herself to obey. This is the real proof of faith, when we restrain our minds, and, as it were, hold them captive, so that they dare not reply this or that to God: for boldness in disputing, on the other hand, is the mother of unbelief. These are weighty expressions, <em>Behold the handmaid of the Lord: </em>for she gives and devotes herself unreservedly to God, that he may freely dispose of her according to his pleasure. Unbelievers withdraw from his hand, and, as far as lies in their power, obstruct his work: but faith presents us before God, that we may be ready to yield obedience. But if the holy virgin was <em>the handmaid of the Lord, </em>because she yielded herself submissively to his authority, there cannot be worse obstinacy than to fly from him, and to refuse that obedience which he deserves and requires. In a word, as faith alone makes us obedient servants to God, and gives us up to his power, so unbelief makes us rebels and deserters. <em>Be it unto me </em>This clause may be interpreted in two ways. Either the holy virgin, leaving her former subject, <span class="cite-ref">(33)</span> betakes herself suddenly to prayers and supplications; or, she proceeds in the same strain <span class="cite-ref">(34)</span> to yield and surrender herself to God. I interpret it simply that she is convinced of the power of God, follows cheerfully where he calls, trusts also to his promise, and not only expects, but eagerly desires, its accomplishment. [We must also observe that she is convinced on the word of the angel, because she knows that it proceeded from God: valuing its credit, not with reference to him who was its messenger, but with reference to him who was its author. <span class="cite-ref">(35)</span> ] </p><p><strong>(33)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Laissant son premier propos</span>.” </p><p><strong>(34)</strong> “Uno contextu.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">En continuant le fil de son propos</span>.” </p><p><strong>(35)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il faut aussi noter qu'elle s'asseure sur la parole de l'Ange, par ce qu'elle sait qu'elle est procedee de Dieu: pesant la dignite d'icelle non a cause de celuy qui en estoit le messager, mais a cause de celui qui en estoit l'autheur</span>.” </p></div>
