<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Let us not be desirous of vain-glory</em>, The special exhortations which were addressed to the Galatians were not more necessary for them than they are adapted to our own time. Of many evils existing in society at large, and particularly in the church, ambition is the mother. Paul therefore directs us to guard against it, for the <em>vain-glory </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">κενοδοξία</span>) of which he speaks is nothing else than <em>ambition</em>, (filimia,) or the desire of honor, by which every one desires to excel all others. The heathen philosophers do not condemn every desire of glory; but among Christians, whoever is desirous of glory departs from true glory, and therefore is justly charged with idle and foolish ambition. It is not lawful for us to glow but in God alone. Every other kind of glorying is pure vanity. Mutual <em>provocations </em>and <em>envyings </em>are the daughters of ambition. He who aspires to the highest rank must of necessity envy all others, and disrespectful, biting, stinging language is the unavoidable consequence. </p></div>
