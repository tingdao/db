Where was the inheritance which he had expected? It might have indeed occurred instantly to his mind, that he had been deceived by God. Still greater was the disappointment, which the Apostle does not mention, when shortly after a famine drove him from the country, when he was compelled to flee to the land of Gerar; but the Apostle considered it enough to say, as a commendation to his faith, that he became a sojourner in the land of promise; for to be a sojourner seemed contrary to what had been promised. That Abraham then courageously sustained this trial was an instance of great fortitude; but it proceeded from faith alone. </p><p><em>With Isaac and Jacob, etc. </em>He does not mean that they dwelt in the same tent, or lived at the same time; but he makes Abraham’s son and grandson his companions, because they sojourned alike in the inheritance promised to them, and yet failed not in their faith, however long it was that God delayed the time; for the longer the delay the greater was the trial; but by setting up the shield of faith they repelled all the assaults of doubt and unbelief. <span class="cite-ref">(217)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(217)</span> The preposition<span class="lang el-gr">μετὰ </span> may often be rendered “as well as.” See <span class="bvs">Mat_2:3</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_11:7</span>, <span class="bvs">1Co_16:11</span>; “dwelling in tents, as well as Isaac and Jacob, co-heirs to the same promise.” It means not here the same time, says Grotius, but parity as to what is stated. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
