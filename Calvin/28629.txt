<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>He who shall eat unworthily, eateth judgment to himself. </em>He had previously pointed out in express terms the heinousness of the crime, when he said that those who should <em>eat unworthily </em>would be <em>guilty of the body and blood of the Lord </em>Now he alarms them, by denouncing punishment; <span class="cite-ref">(706)</span> for there are many that are not affected with the sin itself; unless they are struck down by the judgment of God. This, then, he does, when he declares that this food, otherwise health-giving, will turn out to their destruction, and will be converted into poison to those that <em>eat unworthily </em></p><p>He adds the reasons because they distinguish not the Lord’s body, that is, as a sacred thing from a profane. “They handle the sacred body of Christ with unwashed hands, (<span class="bvs">Mar_7:2</span>,) <span class="cite-ref">(707)</span> nay more, as if it were a thing of nought, they consider not how great is the value of it. <span class="cite-ref">(708)</span> They will therefore pay the penalty of so dreadful a profanation.” Let my readers keep in mind what I stated a little ago, that the body <span class="cite-ref">(709)</span> is presented to them, though their unworthiness deprives them of a participation in it. </p><p><strong>(706)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La punition que Dieu en fera</span>;” — “The punishment that God will inflict upon it.” </p><p><strong>(707)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils manient le corps precieux de Christ irreueremment, c’est a dire, sans nettoyer leur conscience</span>;” — “They handle the precious body of Christ irreverently, that is to say, without washing their conscience.” </p><p><strong>(708)</strong> In the <em>Vat </em>and <em>Alex </em>MSS. and the <em>Copt </em>version, the reading is simply <span class="lang el-gr">μη διακρίνων τὸ σῶμα</span> — <em>not distinguishing the body</em>; while later copies have <span class="lang el-gr">τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Κυρίον</span> — <em>the body of the Lord </em>The verb <span class="lang el-gr">διακρίνω</span> is employed by Herodotus in the sense of distinguishing, in the following expression: <span class="lang el-gr">διακρίνων ουδενα</span> — <em>without any distinction of persons </em>(Herod. 3. 39.) It is supposed by some that the word, as employed here, contains an allusion to the <em>distinguishing </em>of meats under the Mosaic law. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><strong>(709)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le corps de Christ</span>;” — “The body of Christ.” </p></div>
