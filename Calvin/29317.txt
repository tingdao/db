<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>But when all things are reproved. </em>As the participle, (<span class="lang el-gr">φανερούμενον,</span>) which is translated,<em>that which doth make manifest, </em>is in the middle voice, it admits either of a passive or active signification. It may be either rendered, <em>that which is made manifest, </em>or <em>that which doth make manifest. </em>If the passive signification, which is followed by the ancient translator, be preferred, the word <em>light </em>will denote, as formerly, <em>that which gives light, </em>and the meaning will be, that evil works, which had been concealed, will stand out to public view, when they have been <em>made manifest </em>by the word of God: If the participle be taken actively, there will still be two ways of expounding it: 1. Whatever manifests is light; 2. That which manifests anything or all things, is light; taking the singular as put for the plural number. There is no difficulty, as Erasmus dreaded, about the article; for the apostles are not in the habit of adhering very strictly to rule about placing every article, and even among elegant writers this mode of using it would be allowable. The context appears to me to shew clearly that this is Paul’s meaning. He had exhorted them to reprove the evil works of unbelievers, and thus to drag them out of darkness; and he now adds, that what he enjoins upon them is the proper business of light — <em>to make manifest </em>It is Light, he says, which makes all things manifest; and hence it followed that they were unworthy of the name, if they did not bring to light what was involved in darkness. </p></div>
