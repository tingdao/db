<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And the priest shall make an atonement. </em>From this form of expression also, which frequently occurs, we must learn that the victim in itself was not the price of redemption, but that expiation was founded on the priesthood. For they have foolishly and falsely invented the notion that men work something themselves in the sacraments, <span class="cite-ref">(273)</span> whereas their virtue and effect proceeds from quite another quarter. The offering, therefore, properly speaking, is passive rather than active as regards man. <span class="cite-ref">(274)</span> The force of this will be more clearly understood from the delusion of the Papists. They are indeed compelled to acknowledge that in the sacraments men are passive, in so far as they receive the grace there offered to them; but they presently pervert this doctrine, by inventing their <em>opus operatum, </em>as they call it. But, lest the people should think that they bring from their own stores (<em>domo</em>) the price of their redemption, Moses constantly inculcates that it is the peculiar office of the priest, to appease God, and to blot out sin by expiation. It is also worthy of observation that he adds, “before the Lord,” for by this clause the profane notion is refuted, that men are purged by the legal sacrifices only civilly, as they say, <em>i.e., </em>before men, as if there were no spiritual promise included in them. Now, if this were so, the fathers would have been confirmed in the confidence of pardon by no external symbols, than which nothing can be more absurd; but by this one clause all ambiguity is removed, when Moses declares that they were absolved “before the Lord." </p><p><strong>(273)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui’ls apportassent rien du leur aux sacremens</span>;” that they bring something of their own to the sacraments. — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(274)</strong> Addition in <em>Fr., “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">c’est a dire, qu’il n’y apporte rien du sien, mais qu’il y recoit</span>;” that is, that he brings nothing of his own to it, but receives something from it. </p></div>
