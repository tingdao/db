<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Now that he ascended. </em>Here again the slanderers exclaim, that Paul’s reasoning is trifling and childish. “Why does he attempt to make those words apply to a real ascension of Christ, which were figuratively spoken about a manifestation of the Divine glory? Who does not know that the word <em>ascend </em>is metaphorical? The conclusion, <em>that he also descended first, </em>has therefore no weight.” </p><p>I answer, Paul does not here reason in the manner of a logician, as to what necessarily follows, or may be inferred, from the words of the prophet. He knew that what David spake about God’s ascension was metaphorical. But neither can it be denied, that the expression bears a reference to some kind of humiliation on the part of God which had previously existed. It is this humiliation which Paul justly infers from the declaration that God had ascended. And at what time did God descend lower than when Christ <em>emptied himself? </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">᾿Αλλ ᾿ ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσε, </span><span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>.) If ever there was a time when, after appearing to lay aside the brightness of his power, God ascended gloriously, it was when Christ was raised from our lowest condition on earth, and received into heavenly glory. </p><p>Besides, it is not necessary to inquire very carefully into the literal exposition of the Psalm, since Paul merely alludes to the prophet’s words, in the same manner as, on another occasion, he accommodates to his own subject a passage taken from the writings of Moses. “The righteousness which is of faith speaketh in this manner, Say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above;) or, who shall descend into the deep (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.”) (<span class="bvs">Rom_10:6</span><span class="bvs">Deu_30:12</span>.) But the appropriateness of the application which Paul makes of the passage to the person of Christ is not the only ground on which it must be defended. Sufficient evidence is afforded by the Psalm itself, that this ascription of praise relates to Christ’s kingdom. Not to mention other reasons which might be urged, it contains a distinct prophecy of the calling of the Gentiles. </p><p><em>Into the lower parts of the earth. </em><span class="cite-ref">(140)</span> These words mean nothing more than the condition of the present life. To torture them so as to make them mean purgatory or hell, is exceedingly foolish. The argument taken from the comparative degree, “the <em>lower </em>parts,” is quite untenable. A comparison is drawn, not between one part of the earth and another, but between the whole earth and heaven; as if he had said, that from that lofty habitation Christ descended into our deep gulf. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(140)</span> For ‘the lower parts of the earth,’ they may possibly signify no more than the place beneath; as when our Savior said, (<span class="bvs">Joh_8:23</span>,) ‘Ye are from beneath, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world;’ or as God spake by the prophet, ‘I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath.’ Nay, they may well refer to his incarnation, according to that of David, (<span class="bvs">Psa_139:15</span>,) or to his burial.
