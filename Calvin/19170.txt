<div class="comment-content"><p>He says, <em>Heard has been the snorting of horses from Daniel </em>Dan was on the extremities, as it is well known, of the land of Canaan. Some think that the loudness of the noise is intended, as it was heard from such a distance in the holy city itself; but I know not whether this can be gathered from the words of the Prophet. The simpler and the correcter meaning then is, that though Jerusalem rested securely, they were not yet in a quiet state on the borders of the land, for they were disturbed by the snorting of the enemies’ horses. <em>From Dan </em>then <em>has been heard a snorting </em>When the inhabitants of a city indulge in pleasures, while the borders of the land are assailed by enemies, it might be pertinently said to them, “Why do ye here live at your ease? your neighbors and your brethren are exposed to the assaults of enemies: war therefore ought to be waged in your land, though it has not yet reached your gates and your walls.” So the Prophet speaks here: “From Dan has been heard the snorting of his horses.” The relative “his” may be applied to the Assyrians; for the Hebrews often use relatives without antecedents. But it is more probable that Jeremiah refers to the first mover of the war, even God; as though he had said, — “God will send forth hostile armies, which will disturb the borders of your land.” He then calls them the horses of God; for the Chaldeans did not wage that war, but under the authority of God, as we have often seen, and shall have to notice often again. </p><p>Then he says, <em>At the noise of the neighings of his strong ones, </em>etc. He calls the horses “<em>strong,“ </em><span class="lang he-il">אבירים</span>, <em>abirim; </em>and as he had not described them, he now does so. <em>Trembled, </em>he says, <em>has the land at the noise of the neighings of his strong ones </em>As he mentions the neighings of horses, we must understand “strong” as referring to the horses themselves. <em>Come, </em>he says, <em>shall they, and shall devour the land and its fullness, the city and its inhabitants </em>Here is an irregularity as to the number; for he puts city for cities, as he threatens not only Jerusalem, but also the neighboring cities. Whatever then might be the abundance in the land, the enemies would devour it; and he says also, that they would devour the cities and their inhabitants. It follows — </p></div>
