<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>For it was the preparation. </em>This narrative also tends to the edification of our faith; first, because it shows that what had been foretold in the Scriptures is fulfilled in the person of Christ; and, secondly, because it contains a mystery of no ordinary value. The Evangelist says, that <em>the Jews besought </em>that the bodies <em>might be taken down </em>from the crosses. This had undoubtedly been enjoined by the Law of God; but the Jews, as is usually the case with hypocrites, direct their whole attention to small matters, and yet pass by the greatest crimes without any hesitation; for, in order to a strict observance of their Sabbath, they are careful to avoid outward pollution; and yet they do not consider how shocking a crime it is to take away the life of an innocent man. Thus we saw a little before, that </p><p>they did not enter into the governor’s hall, that they might not be defiled, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_18:28</span>,) </p><p>while the whole country was polluted by their wickedness. Yet, by their agency, the Lord carries into effect what was of the greatest importance for our salvation, that, by a wonderful arrangement, the body of Christ remains uninjured, and <em>blood and water low out of his side. </em></p><p><em>And it was the great day of that Sabbath </em><span class="cite-ref">(185)</span> Another reading more generally approved is, <em>and that Sabbath-day was great</em>; but the reading which I have adopted is supported by many manuscripts that are ancient and of great authority. Let the reader choose for himself. If we read <span class="lang el-gr">ἐκείνου</span> in the genitive case, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐκείνου τοῦ σαββάτου</span> of that Sabbath) the word Sabbath must be understood to denote the week; as if the Evangelist had said, that the festival of that week was very solemn, on account of the Passover. Note, the Evangelist speaks of the following day, which began at sunset. But, if we choose rather to read <span class="lang el-gr">ἐκείνη</span>, in the nominative case, <span class="lang el-gr">ἦν γὰρ μεγάλη ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη τοῦ σαββάτου</span>, and <em>That was the great day of the Sabbath</em>, the meaning will be nearly the same in substance; only there would be this difference in the words, that the Passover, which was to take place on the following day, would render that Sabbath more solemn. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(185)</span><span class="lang el-gr">ἦν γὰρ μεγάλη ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη τοῦ σαββάτον</span><em>. “A very solemn festival; </em>namely, as being not only an ordinary Sabbath, but the extraordinary one on the 15<span class="cite-ref">th</span> of Nisan. For <span class="lang el-gr">ἐκείνη</span>, very many MSS., Versions, and early Editions, have <span class="lang el-gr">ἐκείνου</span><em>, </em>which is received by most Editors from Wetstein to Scholz, with the approbation of Bishop <em>Middleton.” </em>— <em>BloomfieId. </em></p></div></div>
