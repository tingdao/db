<div class="comment-content"><p>In the <strong>28</strong><span class="cite-ref">th</span>verse he specifics one of these miracles, which yet was not the first in order, but from which it is easy to gather that God was the author of the deliverance of Israel, and in which the course of nature was entirely changed; for nothing is more astonishing than to see the light turned into darkness. In the second clause, he commends the faithfulness of Moses and Aaron, in courageously executing whatever God had commanded them: <em>And they were not rebellious against his words </em><span class="cite-ref">(224)</span> There was, as if it had been said, the most perfect harmony between the command of God and the obedience of both his servants. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(224)</span> They executed the command of God, with respect to the plagues brought on the Egyptians, although they knew that in thus acting they would incur the heavy displeasure of Pharaoh, and expose their lives to considerable danger. “The import of <span class="lang he-il">מרו לא</span>, <em>they resisted not, </em>” says Hammond, “seems no more than what is affirmed in the story, <span class="bvs">Exo_10:21</span>, ‘The Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand. — And Moses stretched forth his hand,’ — <em>i.e</em>. , readily obeyed, and did what God directed, and that at a time when Pharaoh was likely to be incensed, and vehemently offended with him and Aaron. For which consideration the story there gives us this farther ground: for as, verse 10, he had before expressed some anger and threats, — ‘Look to it, for evil is before you,’ and ‘they were driven from his presence,’ verse 11; so now, upon the hardening his heart, which follows this plague of darkness, he said to Moses, ‘Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more, for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die the death,’ verse 28. This rage of Pharaoh, Moses in reason might well foresee, but he dreaded it not; but boldly did as God directed, and that is the meaning of “they resisted not God’s word.’” </p></div></div>
