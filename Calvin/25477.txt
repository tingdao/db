<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>What shall I do? </em>Wicked men are driven to perplexity in their deliberations, because they do not know how any thing is to be lawfully used; <span class="cite-ref">(269)</span> and, next, because they are intoxicated with a foolish confidence which makes them forget themselves. Thus we find that this <em>rich man </em>lengthens out his expectation of life in proportion to his large income, and drives far away from him the remembrance of death. And yet this pride is accompanied by distrust; for those men, when they have had their fill, are still agitated by insatiable desire, like this <em>rich man, </em>who enlarges his <em>barns, </em>as if his belly, which had been filled with his former <em>barns, </em>had not got enough. At the same time, Christ does not expressly condemn this man for acting the part of a careful householder in storing up his produce, but because his ravenous desire, like a deep whirlpool, swallows up and devours many <em>barns; </em>from which it follows that he does not comprehend the proper use of an abundant produce. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(269)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource qu’ils ne scavent point quel est le droit et legitime usage des creatures de Dieu</span>;” — “because they know not what is the proper and lawful use of the creatures of God.” </p></div></div>
