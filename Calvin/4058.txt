<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>And while the flesh was yet between their teeth. </em>Moses does not specify any particular day; but only that God did not wait till satiety had produced disgust, but inflicted the punishment in the midst of their greediness. We may, however, conjecture from what precedes, that time was given them to gorge themselves. From whence their insatiable voracity may <em>be </em>gathered, which prevailed for so many continuous days, and could not be appeased by any quantity of food. God, therefore, allowed them time abundantly sufficient for them to gorge themselves, unless their gluttony was prodigious: and yet punished their intemperance, while the meat was <em>yet </em>in their mouths. They were, then, suddenly surprised in the midst of their guttling; and hence it is said in the Psalm, (<span class="bvs">Psa_78:30</span>,) “they were not <em>yet </em>estranged from their lust;” just as any glutton might choke himself, by devouring more than his throat could hold. Nor is that at variance with their repletion, of which mention was lately made; for, however the belly may swell with the quantity of its contents, the furious lust of eating is never appeased. But, in order that their punishment might be more manifest, God inflicted it in the very act; nor could any better opportunity have been chosen. </p></div>
