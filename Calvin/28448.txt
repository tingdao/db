Accordingly he admonishes them to consider what honor ought to be rendered to a <em>father</em>, and what to a <em>pedagogue </em><span class="cite-ref">(254)</span> “You entertain respect for those new teachers. To this I have no objection, provided you bear in mind that I am your <em>father</em>, while they are merely <em>pedagogues</em>. ” Now by claiming for himself authority, he intimates that he is actuated by a different kind of affection from that of those whom they so highly esteemed. “They take pains in instructing you. Be it so. Very different is the love of a <em>father</em>, very different his anxiety, very different his attachment from those of a <em>pedagogue </em>What if he should also make an allusion to that imperfection of faith <span class="cite-ref">(255)</span> which he had previously found fault with? For while the Corinthians were giants in pride, they were children in faith, and are, therefore, with propriety, sent to <em>pedagogues </em><span class="cite-ref">(256)</span> He also reproves the absurd and base system of those teachers in keeping their followers in the mere first rudiments, with the view of keeping them always in bonds under their authority. <span class="cite-ref">(257)</span></p><p><em>For in Christ </em>Here we have the reason why he alone ought to be esteemed as the <em>father </em>of the Corinthian Church — because he had <em>begotten </em>it. And truly it is in most appropriate terms that he here describes spiritual generation, when he says that he has <em>begotten them in Christ</em>, who alone is the life of the soul, and makes the gospel the formal cause. <span class="cite-ref">(258)</span> Let us observe, then, that we are <em>then </em>in the sight of God truly <em>begotten</em>, when we are engrafted into Christ, out of whom there will be found nothing but death, and that this is effected by means of <em>the gospel</em>, because, while we are by nature flesh and hay, the word of God, as Peter (<span class="bvs">1Pe_1:24</span>) teaches from Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_40:6</span>,) is <em>the incorruptible seed </em>by which we are renewed to eternal life. Take away the gospel, and we will all remain accursed and dead in the sight of God. That same word by which we are <em>begotten </em>is afterwards <em>milk </em>to us for nourishing us, and it is also <em>solid food </em>to sustain us for ever. <span class="cite-ref">(259)</span></p><p>Should any one bring forward this objection, “As new sons are <em>begotten </em>to God in the Church every day, why does Paul say that those who succeeded him were not <em>fathers </em>?” the answer is easy — that he is here speaking of the <em>commencement </em>of the Church. For although many had been <em>begotten </em>by the ministry of others, this honor remained to Paul untouched — that he had founded the Corinthian Church. Should any one, again, ask, “Ought not all pastors to be reckoned <em>fathers</em>, and if so, why does Paul deprive all others of this title, so as to claim it for himself exclusively?” I answer — “He speaks here comparatively.” Hence, however the title of <em>fathers </em>might be applicable to them in other respects, yet in respect of Paul, they were merely <em>instructors </em>We must also keep in mind what I touched upon a little ago, that he is not speaking of all, (for as to those who were like himself, as, for example, Apollos, Silvanus, and Timotheus, who aimed at nothing but the advancement of Christ’s kingdom, he would have had no objection to their being so named, and having the highest honor assigned to them,) but is reproving those who, by a misdirected ambition, transferred to themselves the glory that belonged to another. Of this sort were those who robbed Paul of the honor that was due to him, that they might set themselves off in his spoils. </p><p>And, truly, the condition of the Church universal at this day is the same as that of the Corinthian Church was at that time. For how few are there that love the Churches with a <em>fatherly</em>, that is to say, a disinterested affection, and lay themselves out to promote their welfare! Meanwhile, there are very many <em>pedagogues</em>, who give out their services as hirelings, in such a manner as to discharge as it were a mere temporary office, and in the meantime hold the people in subjection and admiration. <span class="cite-ref">(260)</span> At the same time, even in that case it is well when there are many <em>pedagogues</em>, who do good, at least, to some extent by teaching, and do not destroy the Church by the corruptions of false doctrine. For my part, when I complain of the multitude of pedagogues, I do not refer to Popish priests, (for I would not do them the honor of reckoning them in that number,) but those who, while agreeing with us in doctrine, employ themselves in taking care of their own affairs, rather than those of Christ. We all, it is true, wish to be reckoned <em>fathers</em>, and require from others the obedience of sons, but where is the man to be found who acts in such a manner as to show that he is a <em>father </em>? <span class="cite-ref">(261)</span></p><p>There remains another question of greater difficulty: As Christ forbids us to </p><p>call any one father upon earth, because we have one Father in heaven, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_23:9</span>,) </p><p>how does Paul dare to take to himself the name of<em>father </em>? I answer, that, properly speaking, God alone is the Father, not merely of our soul, but also of our flesh. As, however, in so far as concerns the body, he communicates the honor of his paternal name to those to whom he gives offspring, while, as to souls, he reserves to himself exclusively the right and title of Father, I confess that, on this account, he is called in a peculiar sense <em>the Father of spirits</em>, and is distinguished from earthly <em>fathers</em>, as the Apostle speaks in <span class="bvs">Heb_12:9</span>. As, however, notwithstanding that it is he alone who, by his own influence, begets souls, and regenerates and quickens them, he makes use of the ministry of his servants for this purpose, there is no harm in their being called <em>fathers</em>, in respect of this ministry, as this does not in any degree detract from the honor of God. The word, as I have said, is the spiritual seed. God alone by means of it regenerates our souls by his influence, but, at the same time, he does not exclude the efforts of ministers. If, therefore, you attentively consider, what God accomplishes by himself, and what he designs to be accomplished by ministers, you will easily understand in what sense he alone is worthy of the name of <em>Father</em>, and how far this name is applicable to his ministers, without any infringement upon his rights. </p><p><strong>(254)</strong> “The Greek word <em>pedagogue</em>, ” says <em>Calmet</em>, “now carries with it an idea approaching to contempt. With no other word to qualify it, it excites the idea of a pedant, who assumes an air of authority over others, which does not belong to him. But among the ancients a pedagogue was a person to whom they committed the care of their children, to lead them, to observe them, and to instruct them in their first rudiments. Thus the office of a pedagogue nearly answered to that of a governor or tutor, who constantly attends his pupil, teaches him, and forms his manners. Paul (<span class="bvs">1Co_4:15</span>) says: “For though you have ten thousand instructors (<em>pedagogues</em>) in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers’ — representing himself as their father in the faith, since he had <em>begotten them in the gospel</em>. The <em>pedagogue</em>, indeed, may have some power and interest in his pupil, but he can never have the natural tenderness of a <em>father </em>for him.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><strong>(255)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quel mal y auroit-il, quand nous dirions, qu’il fait aussi vne allusion a ceste petitesse et enfance en la foy</span> ?” — “What harm were there, though we should say that he also makes an allusion to that littleness and childhood in the faith?” </p><p><strong>(256)</strong> Our Author evidently alludes to the etymology of the original term <span class="lang el-gr">παιδαγωγοὺς</span>, as being derived from <span class="lang el-gr">παῖς</span>, a <em>boy</em>, and <span class="lang el-gr">ἄγω</span>, to <em>lead </em>Such instructors were generally slaves, whose business it was to attend upon their youthful charge, to observe their behavior, and to <em>lead </em>them to and from school.
