<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>Is better than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices. </em>But it appears to be incongruous that <em>sacrifices, </em>which are a part of divine worship, and belong to the first table of the Law, should be reckoned of less importance than charity towards men. The reply is, Though the worship of God is greatly preferable, and is more valuable than all the duties of a holy life, yet its outward exercises ought not to be estimated so highly as to swallow up brotherly kindness. For we know that brotherly kindness, in itself and simply, is pleasing to God, though <em>sacrifices </em>are not regarded by him with delight or approbation, except with a view to another object. Besides, it is naked and empty <em>sacrifices </em>that are here spoken of; for our Lord contrasts a hypocritical appearance of piety with true and sincere uprightness. The same doctrine is to be found very frequently in the prophets, that hypocrites may know that <em>sacrifices </em>are of no value, unless spiritual truth be joined to them, and that God is not appeased by offerings of beasts, where brotherly kindness is neglected. </p></div>
