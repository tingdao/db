<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>For thou wilt prevent him. </em>The change of the tense in the verbs does not break the connection of the discourse; and, therefore, I have, without hesitation, translated this sentence into the future tense, as we know that the changing of one tense into another is quite common in Hebrew. Those who limit this psalm to the last victory which David gained over foreign nations, and who suppose that the crown of which mention is here made was the crown of the king of the Ammonites, of which we have an account in sacred history, give, in my judgment, too low a view of what the Holy Spirit has here dictated concerning the perpetual prosperity of this kingdom. David, I have no doubt, comprehended his successors even to Christ, and intended to celebrate the continual course of the grace of God in maintaining his kingdom through successive ages. It was not of one man that it had been said, </p><p>“I will be his father, and he shall be my son,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Sa_7:14</span>;) </p><p>but this was a prophecy which ought to be extended from Solomon to Christ, as is fully established by the testimony of Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_9:6</span>,) who informs us that it was fulfilled when the Son was given or manifested. When it is said, <em>Thou wilt prevent him, </em>the meaning is, that such will be the liberality and promptitude of God, in spontaneously bestowing blessings, that he will not only grant what is asked from him, but, anticipating the requests of the king, will load him with every kind of good things far beyond what he had ever expected. By <em>blessings </em>we are to understand abundance or plenteousness. Some translate the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">טוב</span>, <em>tob, goodness; </em><span class="cite-ref">(481)</span> but with this I cannot agree. It is to be taken rather for <em>the beneficence </em>or<em>the free gifts of God. </em>Thus the meaning will be, The king shall want nothing which is requisite to make his life in every respect happy, since God of his own good pleasure will anticipate his wishes, and enrich him with an abundance of all good things. The Psalmist makes express mention of <em>the crown, </em>because it was the emblem and ensign of royalty; and he intimates by this that God would be the guardian of the king, whom he himself had created. But as the prophet testifies, that the royal diadem, after lying long dishonored in the dust, shall again be put upon the head of Christ, we come to the conclusion, that by this song the minds of the godly were elevated to the hope of the eternal kingdom, of which a shadow only, or an obscure image, was set forth in the person of the successors of David. The doctrine of the everlasting duration of the kingdom of Christ is, therefore, here established, seeing he was not placed upon the throne by the favor or suffrages of men, but by God, who, from heaven, set the royal crown upon his head with his own hand. </p><p><strong>(481)</strong> Reading “blessings of goodness;” that is, the best or most excellent blessings. </p></div>
