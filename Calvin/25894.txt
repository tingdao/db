<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>And I appoint to you the kingdom. </em>Here he makes them not only judges, but <em>kings; </em>for he shares with them <em>the kingdom </em>which he received from <em>the Father </em>There is an emphasis in the word <em>appoint</em>, that they may not, by warmth and vehemence of desire, hasten too eagerly to possess <em>the kingdom </em>of which he alone has the lawful right to dispose. By his own example, also, he exhorts them to patience; for, though he was ordained by <em>the Father </em>to be a King, yet he was not immediately raised to his glory, but even <em>emptied Himself</em>, (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>,) and by the ignominy of the cross obtained kingly honor. To <em>eat and drink at his table </em>is put metaphorically for being made partakers of the same glory. </p></div>
