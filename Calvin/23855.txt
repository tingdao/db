<div class="comment-content"><p>This conclusion shows what is the object of the parable, when Christ prefers to the scribes and priests those who were generally accounted infamous and held in detestation; for he unmasks those hypocrites, <span class="cite-ref">(33)</span> that they may no longer boast of being the ministers of God, or hold out a pretended zeal for godliness. Though their ambition, and pride, and cruelty, and avarice, were known to all, yet they wished to be reckoned quite different persons. And when, but a little ago, they attacked Christ, they falsely alleged that they were anxious about the order of the Church, as if they were its faithful and honest guardians. Since they attempt to practice such gross imposition on God and men, Christ rebukes their impudence by showing that they were at the greatest possible distance from what they boasted, and were so far from deserving that elevation with which they flattered themselves, that they ranked below <em>the publicans and the harlots </em>For as to the profession which they made of being eminent in observing the worship of God, and of being zealots of the Law, Christ tells them that it is quite as if <em>a son </em>were, in words, to promise obedience to <em>his father, </em>but afterwards to deceive him. <span class="cite-ref">(34)</span> So far as regards <em>the publicans and the harlots, </em>he does not excuse their vices, but compares their dissolute life to the obstinacy of a rebellious and debauched <em>son, </em>who at first throws off his father’s authority; but shows that they are greatly preferable to the scribes and Pharisees in this respect, that they do not continue to the end in their vices, but, on the contrary, submit gently and obediently to the yoke which they had fiercely rejected. We now perceive the design of Christ. Not only does he reproach the priests and scribes with obstinately opposing God, and not repenting, though so frequently admonished, but he strips them of the honor of which they were unworthy, <em>because </em>their ungodliness was worse than the lasciviousness of <em>the harlots. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(33)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car il oste a ces hypocritesssss le masque duquel ils se couvroyent</span>;” — “for he takes away from those hypocrites the mask with which they covered themselves.” “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et puis qu’il l’abusast, it n’en feist rien</span>;” — “and afterwards deceived him, and did nothing of it.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(34)</span> "<span class="lang fr-fr">Et puis qu'il l'abusast, et n'en feist rein</span>;" — "and afterwards deceived him, and did nothing of it." </p></div></div>
