He subjoins one exception — that he <em>had not been burdensome to them; </em>and this, by way of <em>irony, </em>for in reality this was over and above so many acts of kindness, which he had conferred upon them — that he had served them gratuitously. To busy themselves after this, as they did, in pouring contempt upon him, what was this but to insult his modesty? Nay, what cruelty there was in it! Hence, it is not without good reason, that he sharply reproves pride so frantic. <em>Forgive me this wrong, </em>says he. For they were doubly ungrateful, inasmuch as they not only contemned the man, by whose acts of kindness they had been brought under obligation, but even turned his kind disposition into an occasion of reproach. Chrysostom is of opinion, that there is no <em>irony </em>implied, and that, instead of this, there is an expression of apology; but, if any one examines the entire context more narrowly, he will easily perceive, that this gloss is quite foreign to Paul’s intention. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(930)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Aux injures et detractions</span>;” — “The insults and slanders.” </p></div></div>
