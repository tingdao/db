<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>And he shall bring his trespass-offering. </em>He proceeds with what we have already been considering, as to the removal of guilt by sacrifice; but he begins to make a distinction between the poor and the rich, which distinction applies also to what has gone before; hence it appears that the order is not exactly observed by Moses, since the cases which he inserts seem to interrupt the thread of his discourse; yet the fact remains clear, that whosoever have fallen through error are unclean until they have offered an atonement. But what had been before omitted is here inserted, that the poor and needy are not to be pressed beyond the extent of their means; nay, the different grades of offering are appointed, so that he to whom it was not convenient to offer two turtle-doves, or pigeons, might be quit for a small measure of flour. Hence we infer that God’s only design was to shew the one true means of reconciliation to the people, that they might have recourse to the Mediator and His sacrifice; for the poor are here commanded to offer either two turtle-doves, or a small quantity of meal, which would propitiate God towards them, just as much as would the victim required of the rich. The citation, <span class="cite-ref">(268)</span> however, which our interpreters make from the poet is a lame one; viz., “Whoever shall have brought integrity of mind into the temples, makes a sacrifice of corn;” since this blind man did not see what was the object of sacrifices, and thus despised all kinds of propitiations, as if purity and innocency alone recommended men to God. We must remember, then, that the victims of themselves were of no importance, and yet that the ancient people were exercised in these ceremonies, to teach them that God can only be appeased by the payment of a ransom. </p><p><strong>(268)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Un poete payen a dit, ‘que celuy qui offrira un grain d’encens, ou un espi de ble en integritd de coeur, appaisera Dieu autant que s’il tuoit une centaine de bestes.’ Or, Il n’a parle qu’a demi, et m’esbahi comment les Chrestiens osent alleguer ceste sentence comme vraye</span>;” a heathen poet has said, that he who shall offer a grain of incense, or an ear of corn in integrity of heart, will appease God as much as if he had killed a hundred beasts. Now he only spoke by halves; and I am astonished how Christians dare to allege this sentence, as if it were true. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p>The reference is probably to Persius, Sat 2, <em>in finem </em>— </p><p><em>" </em><em>Composttum jus, fasque animi, sanctosque recessus </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Mentis, et incoctum generoso pectus honesto, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Hoc cedo ut admoveam templis, </em>etfarre litabo." </p><p>Horace has nearly the same idea, Od. 3:23, 17-20 — </p><p><em>" </em><em>Immunis aram si tetigit manus, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Non sumptuosa blandior hostia </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Mollivit aversos Penates </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Farre pio, et saliente mica </em><em>." </em></p></div>
