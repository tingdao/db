<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>That we may rejoice in thy salvation. </em>This verse may be explained in two other ways, besides the sense it bears according to the translation which I have given. Some consider it to be a prayer, as if it had been said, Lord, make us to rejoice. Others think that the faithful, after having finished their prayer, encourage themselves to entertain good hope; <span class="cite-ref">(474)</span> or rather, being already inspired with an assured hope of success, they begin to sing, so to speak, of the victory, even as it is usual with David to intermingle such kind of rejoicings with his prayers, thereby to stir up himself to continue with the more alacrity in prayer. But upon considering the whole more carefully, my opinion is, that what is meant to be expressed is the effect or fruit which would result from the bestowment of the grace and favor of God, for which the people prayed; and, therefore, I have thought it necessary to supply the particle <em>that, </em>in the beginning of the verse. The faithful, as an argument to obtain the favor of God towards their king, set forth the joy which they would all experience in common, in seeing it exercised towards him, and the thanksgiving which they would with one accord render for it. The import of their language is, It is not for the preservation and welfare of one man that we are solicitous; it is for the safety and well-being of the whole Church. The expression, <em>In thy salvation, </em>may be referred to God as well as to the king; for the salvation which God bestows is often called <em>the salvation of God; </em>but the context requires that it should be rather understood of the king. The people lived “under the shadow of the king,” to use the words of Jeremiah, (<span class="bvs">Lam_4:20</span>;) and, therefore, the faithful now testify, that as long as he is safe and in prosperity, they will all be joyful and happy. At the same time, to distinguish their joy from the heathen dancings and rejoicings, they declare that they will set up their banners in the name of God; for the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">דגל</span>, <em>dagal, </em>here used, means <em>to set </em>or <em>lift up a banner. </em>The meaning is, that the faithful, in grateful acknowledgement of the grace of God, will celebrate his praises and triumph in his name. </p><p><strong>(474)</strong> Meaning, “We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God will we set up our banners.” </p></div>
