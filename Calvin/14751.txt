<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18</strong><em>He hath redeemed my soul into peace </em>Those who read the two preceding verses in the perfect instead of the future tense, are apparently led to this by considering that David here proves his former prayers to have been answered, from the fact of deliverance having been granted. But there is no difficulty involved in adopting the other reading. We may suppose that either he was so confident of being delivered that he speaks as if he actually were so already, or that he inserts what was the substance of his meditations at different times; it being sufficiently common, when mention is made of prayers, to subjoin a statement of the event which followed from them. Having spoken, then, of his prayers, he adverts to the result of them, with the view of expressing his thankfulness for the mercy which he had received. He says that he had been <em>redeemed into peace </em>— a strong expression, signifying the danger to which he had been exposed, and the almost miraculous manner in which he had been delivered from it. What is added, <em>they were in great numbers with me, </em>admits of a double meaning. Some understand him as referring to enemies; <em>with me </em>being, according to them, equivalent to <em>against me. He </em>represents himself as having been beset, by a host of adversaries, and commends the goodness manifested by God in accomplishing his deliverance. Others think that he refers to the angels, whose hosts are encamped round about those that fear the Lord, (<span class="bvs">Psa_34:7</span>.) The letter <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>,<em>beth, </em>which I have rendered <em>in, </em>they consider to be here, as in many other places, merely expletive; <span class="cite-ref">(313)</span> so that we may read the words, <em>great numbers were with me. </em>The last of these interpretations conveys a comfortable truth, as God, although he cannot stand in need of auxiliaries, has seen fit, in accommodation to our infirmity, to employ a multitude of them in the accomplishment of our salvation. But David would appear rather to speak of enemies, and to refer to the number of them, with the view of magnifying the deliverance which he had received. <span class="cite-ref">(314)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(313)</span> Rogers is of this opinion; and observes, that “in the Appendix to the first volume of Glassius, many instances are adduced of the redundancy of the prefix <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>; as <span class="bvs">Exo_32:22</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_68:5</span>; <span class="bvs">Ezr_3:3</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(314)</span> Walford renders the sentence, “Though multitudes be in opposition to me.” “The sense,” says he, “which is here given, is evidently required, and is fairly deducible from the Hebrew text.” Bishop Horsley’s rendering is, “For they who stood on my side told for many;” — “they who stood on my side,” denoting the Divine assistance described under the image of numerous auxiliaries. See <span class="bvs">2Kg_6:16</span>; <span class="bvs">1Jo_4:4</span>. Bishop Mant is satisfied that this is the Psalmist’s meaning, and he accordingly turns the verse thus: — </p><p>“And he shall hear me, he shall shield,<LineBreak />And he with peace shall crown;<LineBreak />My guardian in the battle-field,<LineBreak />An host himself alone.” </p></div></div>
