<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And repayeth them that hate him</em>. There is no mention here made of the vengeance “unto the third and fourth generation? <span class="cite-ref">(222)</span></p><p>Those who expound the passage that God confers kindnesses on the wicked, whilst they are living in this world, <span class="cite-ref">(223)</span> that He may at length destroy them in final perdition, wrest the words too violently. Nor is the opinion of others probable, that God repays the wicked with the reward of hatred, in His <em>face</em>, or anger. I therefore interpret it to mean the face of those to whose disobedience God opposes Himself when He humbles their arrogance; for He alludes to their pride and audacity, because they do not hesitate to provoke God, as if He were without the courage or the power to contend with them. He declares, then, that their impudence and brazen front shall avail them nothing, but that He will cast down the impertinence of their countenance, and the insolence of their forehead; and signifies that they shall as certainly feel the judgment which they despise, as if He presented it before their eyes. He adds, moreover, that He will not deal towards the wicked with the clemency which he uses towards His children; for He so chastises them that His correction is always profitable for their salvation, whilst He denounces deadly punishment against the former; for although He seems to deal alike with both, when He inflicts temporal punishment, still, that which is but a medicine for believers, is to the reprobate a foretaste of their eternal destruction. What He says, however, as to taking vengeance without delay, does not seem to accord with other passages of Scripture, in which He declares Himself to be slow to anger, kind, and long-suffering. Besides, it seems also to be contradicted by experience, since He does not immediately hasten to inflict punishment, but proceeds slowly, so as to compensate by His severity for the slowness with which He acts. But we must remember what He says in <span class="bvs">Psa_90:4</span>, that a thousand years in His sight are but as a single day; and consequently, when we think that He delays, He is, in His infinite wisdom, hastening as much as is necessary. He seems, indeed, to take no notice for a time, that He may thus invite men to repent; but still He declares that He will not delay, but that He will come suddenly, like a whirlwind, to hasten His judgments, lest the ungodly should grow drowsy from their security. Let us, therefore, learn quietly and patiently to wait for the fit season of His vengeance. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(222)</span> Added in <em>Fr</em>. , “Mais seulement que Dieu punira les delinquans;” but only that God will punish the transgressors. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(223)</span> The question is as to the word <span class="lang he-il">פניו</span>, literally <em>his </em>or <em>their face</em>.
