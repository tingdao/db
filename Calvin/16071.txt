<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>172.</strong><em>My tongue shall speak of thy word. </em>Here the Psalmist says, that when he shall have profited in God’s law he will also employ himself in teaching it to others. This order is undoubtedly to be observed, That divine truth take root in our hearts before we engage in the work of teaching it to others. Yet every man, according to the measure of his faith, ought to communicate to his brethren what he has received, that the doctrine, whose use and fruit God ‘would have to be displayed for the common edification of the Church, may not be buried. There is added the reason which ought to stir up all the godly to declare the law of God — namely, because by this means righteousness is spread abroad through the whole world. When the Prophet honors the commandments of God with the title of <em>righteousness, </em>he does not simply express his approbation of them, but he indirectly shows, that, until this rule bear sway in governing mankind, the whole world is one scene of sad and horrible confusion. Yet, let my readers judge whether the word <em>answer </em>or <em>witness, </em>which the Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">ענה</span>, <em>anah, </em>properly signifies, is not more suitable in this place than <em>speak; </em>bringing out this sense — “My tongue shall bear witness or answer to thy word; because the true knowledge of righteousness is to be sought only in the word;” but in that case, it will be necessary to supply the letter <span class="lang he-il">ל</span>, <em>lamed, in </em>the word <span class="lang he-il">אמרתך</span>, <em>imrathecha, </em>that it may read — <em>to thy word. </em></p></div>
