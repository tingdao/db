<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet first says that <em>Jerusalem had expanded her hands</em>, as a token of sorrow, or that she might seek friends from every side; for when we wish to move men to pity, we stretch forth our arms. I wonder how it came to the minds of some to say that Jerusalem had broken bread with her hands. This is extremely puerile. Some have rendered the words, that she had broken with her hands, understanding thereby that she had clapped with her hands. It is, however, a harsh mode of speaking; I retain the most suitable sense, that <em>Jerusalem had expanded her hands</em>. The word <span class="lang he-il">פרש</span>, <em>peresh</em>, means also to disperse, or scatter; but the Prophet no doubt means the expansion of the hands, as though Jerusalem had said that she was like a woman lamenting her calamities, and seeking friends on every side to give her some consolation. And we may gather the meaning of the Prophet from the passage itself, S<em>ion</em>, it is said, <em>by spreading hands calls her friends, and no one is a comforter</em>: these clauses ought to be read together, that is, that Sion expanded her hands, and yet no one responded to alleviate her sorrow by consolation. </p><p>It follows, that <em>Jehovah had commanded respecting Jacob, that through his circuits adversaries should afflict him</em>. The Prophet again reminds us that these evils did not happen through men, but that God had resolved in this manner to punish the obstinate impiety of the people. Lest, then, the Jews should give vent to their sorrow, and ascribe it to the Chaldeans, as it was commonly done, he recalls their attention to God himself, and says that the Chaldeans, however cruel they were, yet did nothing merely through their own impulse, but through God’s command. He adds, <em>through the circuits</em>, that the Jews might know that there was no escape, for God held them all as though they were shut up. For we can in various ways escape from the hands of men; but when God is our enemy, we in vain seek hiding-places. The Prophet then teaches us that subterfuges did not avail the Jews, because God on every side kept them shut up. </p><p>He says at length that <em>Jerusalem was like a menstruous woman</em>, or was an abomination; for <span class="lang he-il">נדה</span>, <em>nede</em>, may be rendered uncleanness, or abomination, and is often a noun substantive; and I am disposed so to render it, even that Jerusalem was regarded as filth, as though the Prophet had said that there was no humanity or moderation in the enemies of the Jews, because they were not counted as men, but as offscourings, as an abominable filth. <span class="cite-ref">(143)</span></p><p>Now, if such a thing happened to the ancient Church, let us not wonder if at this day also God should deal with us more severely than we wish. It is, indeed, a very bitter thing to see the Church so afflicted as to have the ungodly exulting over its calamities, and that God’s children should be as the refuse and filth of the world. But let us patiently bear such a condition; and when we are thus contemptuously treated by our enemies, let us know that God visits us with punishment, and that the wicked do nothing except through the providence of God, for it is his will to try our faith, and thus to shew himself a righteous judge: for if we rightly consider in how many ways, and how obstinately we have provoked his wrath, we shall not wonder if we also be counted at this day an abomination and a curse. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(143)</strong> The same word, <span class="lang he-il">נדה</span> occurs in <span class="bvs">Lam_1:8</span>, only there is a <span class="lang he-il">י</span> in it; and the phrase in its form is similar. The Versions, except the, <em>Syr</em>. , and also the <em>Targ</em>. , give to it there the idea of wandering, but here of uncleanness. There seems to be no reason for this change; and the end of the next verse favors the idea of wandering: Jerusalem had become a wanderer, or a fugitive, among her oppressors, — </p><p>  </p><p><strong>17.</strong>Expanded hath Sion her hands, no comforter is to her;<LineBreak />Commanded has Jehovah as to Jacob, <em>Let </em>those around him <em>be </em>his oppressors; Become has Jerusalem a wanderer among them. </p><p>The word <span class="lang he-il">נד</span> is a fugitive, a wanderer, and as Jerusalem is feminine, <span class="lang he-il">ה</span> is added, a feminine termination. “Jerusalem” here, as in <span class="bvs">Lam_1:8</span>, means its citizens. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
