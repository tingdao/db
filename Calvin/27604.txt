<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Who used curious crafts. </em>Luke doth not only speak of magical jugglings, but of frivolous and vain studies, whereof the more part of men is for the most part too desirous. For he useth the word, <span class="lang el-gr">περιεργα</span>, under which the Grecians comprehend whatsoever things have in themselves no sound commodity, but lead men’s minds and studies through diverse crooks unprofitably. Such is judicial astrology, as they call it, and whatsoever divinations men<span class="cite-ref">(378)</span> invent to themselves against the time to come. They burn their books, that they may cut off all occasion of erring, both for themselves and for others. And whereas the greatness of the price doth not call them back from endamaging themselves so much, they do thereby better declare the study [zeal] of their godliness. Therefore, as Luke did of late describe their confession in words, so now he setteth down the confession they make in deeds. But because the Grecians take <span class="lang el-gr">αργυριον</span> for all kind of money, it is uncertain whether Luke doth speak of pence or sestertians.<span class="cite-ref">(379)</span> Notwithstanding, because it is certain that he expressed a sum, that we might know that the faithful did valiantly contemn gain, I do nothing doubt but that he meaneth pence, or some other better kind of coin.<span class="cite-ref">(380)</span> And fifty thousand pence (denarii) make about nine thousand pound of French money [French livres].</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(378)</span></p><p>“ Stulti homines,” foolish men. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(379)</span></p><p>“ Sesterties an densrios,” “ sestertii an densrios.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(380)</span></p><p>“Densrios vel aliquod etiam praestantius numismatis genus ,” denarii, or even some more valuable species of coin. </p></div></div>
