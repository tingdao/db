<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>I will incline my ear </em><span class="cite-ref">(214)</span><em>to a parable </em>The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">משל</span><em>, mashal, </em><span class="cite-ref">(215)</span> which I have translated <em>parable, </em>properly denotes a <em>similitude; </em>but it is often applied to any deep or weighty sayings, because these are generally embellished with figures and metaphors. The noun which follows, <span class="lang he-il">חידת</span>, <em>chidoth </em><span class="cite-ref">(216)</span> and which I have rendered <em>an enigma, </em>or <em>riddle, </em>is to be understood in nearly the same sense. In <span class="bvs">Eze_17:2</span>, we have both the nouns with their corresponding verbs joined together, <span class="lang he-il">חור חידה ומשל משל</span>, <em>chud chedah umshol mashal, </em>the literal translation being, “Enigmatize an enigma, and parabolize a parable.” I am aware that the reference in this place is to an allegorical discourse, but I have already adverted to the reason why, in Hebrew, the name of enigmas or similitudes is given to any remarkable or important sayings. The Psalmist, when he adds that he will <em>open </em>his dark saying, shows that nothing was farther from his intention than to wrap the subject of his discourse in perplexing and intricate obscurity. The truths of revelation are so high as to exceed our comprehension; but, at the same time, the Holy Spirit has accommodated them so far to our capacity, as to render all Scripture profitable for instruction. None can plead ignorance: for the deepest and most difficult doctrines are made plain to the most simple and unlettered of mankind. I see little force in the idea suggested by several interpreters, of the Psalmist having employed his <em>harp, </em>that he might render a subject in itself harsh and disagreeable more engaging by the charms of music. He would merely follow the usual practice of accompanying the psalm with the harp. </p><p><strong>(214)</strong> Bythner and Fry are of opinion, that “the inclining of the ear” is a metaphor taken from the position of the minstrel, who, in accommodating his words to the tune, brings his ear close to the harp, that he may catch the sounds. Thus the Psalmist expresses the sense he himself had of the importance of his subject, and his purpose of giving to it the most serious attention. </p><p><strong>(215)</strong> This word is of great latitude in its signification. It signifies primarily any similitude by which another thing is expressed. Thence it comes to denote a figurative discourse, either in the form of fiction and fable, such as riddles or significant apologues, as that of Jotham, <span class="bvs">Jud_9:7</span>, or in which application is made of some true example or similitude, as when the sluggard is bidden “go to the ant,” and the impenitent sinner to consider the “swallow and crane,” which return at their certain seasons, and so are fitted to give a lesson to sinners to repent. And, finally, it belongs to all moral doctrine, either darkly or sententiously delivered; wise men, in ancient times, having been in the habit of delivering their lessons in short concise sentences, sometimes in schemes and figures, and sometimes without them, as we see in the Proverbs of Solomon, many of which are plain moral sayings without any figure or comparison. Of this sort is that which is here introduced to our attention; it is a moral theme not much veiled with figures, nor so concise as proverbs usually are, but which contains the most instructive lessons on the vanity of the prosperity of all wicked men. See Hammond <em>in loco</em>. </p><p><strong>(216)</strong> This word is derived from an Arabic root which signifies <em>to bend a thing aside</em>, <em>to tie knots</em>, <em>etc</em>. ; and thus it means <em>an intricate species of composition</em>, <em>a riddle </em>It is used for <em>a riddle </em>in the story of Samson, <span class="bvs">Jud_14:14</span>; and for <em>difficult questions</em>, as those put by the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, <span class="bvs">1Kg_10:1</span>. See Lowth’s Lectures on Sacred Poetry, volume1, p. 78. Accordingly, it is here rendered by the Septuagint, “<span class="lang el-gr">τὸ πρόβλημά μου</span>,” “my problem or difficult question,” which is not only asked in the fifth verse, but also answered in the subsequent verses. The word, however, is also applied to poetical compositions of a highly adorned and finished style, in which nothing enigmatical appears, but which contain weighty and important matter set forth in the parabolic style to secure the reader’s or the hearer’s attention, <span class="bvs">Psa_78:2</span>. See Gesenius’ Lexicon. In the subject-matter of this psalm there does not appear to be any thing peculiarly intricate. It treats of the vanity of riches, and the folly of those who trust in them; their insufficiency to save from the power of death; and the final triumph of all the suffering people of God over their rich and haughty persecutors. This is indeed a dark theme to the worldly-minded man; but it contains nothing occult or mysterious to those who are taught of God. </p></div>
