<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>And it came to pass as she came unto him, </em>etc Although we may conjecture that the damsel Acsa was of excellent morals and well brought up, as marriage with her had been held forth as the special reward <span class="cite-ref">(149)</span> of victory, yet perverse cupidity on her part is here disclosed. She knew that by the divine law women were specially excluded from hereditary lands, but she nevertheless covets the possession of them, and stimulates her husband by unjust expostulation. In this way ambitious and covetous wives cease not to molest their husbands until they force them to forget shame, modesty, and equity. For although the avarice of men also is insatiable, yet women are apt to be much more precipitate. The more carefully ought husbands to be on their guard against being set as it were on flame by the blast of such importunate counsels. <span class="cite-ref">(150)</span></p><p>But a greater degree of intemperance is displayed when she acquires additional boldness from the facility of her husband and the indulgence of her father. Not contented with the field given to her, she demands for herself a well-watered district. And thus it is when a person has once overleaped the bounds of rectitude and honesty, the fault is forthwith followed up by impudence. Moreover, her father in refusing her nothing gives proof of his singular affection for her. But it does not therefore follow that the wicked thirst of gain which blinds the mind and perverts right judgment is the less hateful. In regard to Acsa’s dismounting from the ass, some interpreters ascribe it to dissimulation and craft, as if she were pretending inability to retain her seat from grief. In this way her dismounting or falling off is made an indication of criminality and defective character. It is more simple, however, to suppose that she placed herself at her father’s feet with the view of accosting him as a suppliant. Be this as it may, by her craft and flattery she gained his consent, and in so far diminished the portion of her brothers. <span class="cite-ref">(151)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(149)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour un salaire exquis et precieux</span>;” “As an exquisite and precious recompense.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(150)</span> Latin, “Foeminae tamen magis praecipites feruntur.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les femmes sont beaucoup plus bouillantes, et se laissent transporter plus aisement.

It ought to be remembered, that in cases of succession the preference given to males is only conventional, and that by natural law her brothers’ title was not a whit better than her own. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
