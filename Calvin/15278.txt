<div class="comment-content"><p>The godly, still dwelling on the same theme, ask, in the 6<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, whether <em>God will not turn again and quicken them </em>Being fully convinced of the truth of this principle, That the punishments with which God chastises his children are only temporary; they thereby encourage themselves in the confident expectation, that although he may be now justly displeased, and may have turned away his face from them, yet, when they implore his mercy, he will be entreated, and raising the dead to life again, will turn their mourning into gladness. By the word <em>quicken, </em>they complain that they almost resemble persons who are dead, or that they are stunned and laid prostrate with afflictions. And when they promise themselves matter of rejoicing, they intimate that in the meantime they are well nigh worn out with sorrow. </p></div>
