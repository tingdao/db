He does not, however, immediately declare to whom they are to be paid, but inserts some provisions respecting other offerings, which I have elsewhere explained. But when, soon afterwards, in verse 27, he recommends the Levites to them, he shews what is the proper use to which they are to be applied. He signifies that it would be cruel to defraud the Levites of them, <span class="cite-ref">(217)</span> and that they would be wicked and unjust if they were grudgingly to pay them the tithes, which were theirs by hereditary right, since their tribe possessed no inheritance in land. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(217)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">S’ils soustrayent et desrobbent a leurs freres ce qui est assigne pour leur nouristure</span> :” if they withheld and stole from their brethren what was assigned them for their maintenance. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
