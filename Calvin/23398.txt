<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_9:18</span><strong>.</strong><em>While he was speaking these things to them. </em>Those who imagine that the narrative, which is here given by Mark and Luke, is different from that of Matthew, are so clearly refuted by the passage itself, that there is no necessity for a lengthened debate. All the three agree in saying that Christ was requested by <em>a ruler of the synagogue to enter his house </em>for the purpose of curing <em>his daughter </em>The only difference is, that the name of <em>Jairus, </em>which is withheld by Matthew, is mentioned by Mark and Luke; and that he represents the father as saying, <em>My daughter is dead, </em>while the other two say that she was in her last moments, and that, while he was bringing Christ, her death was announced to him on the road. But there is no absurdity in saying that Matthew, studying brevity, merely glances at those particulars which the other two give in minute detail. But since all the other points agree with such exactness, since so many circumstances conspire as to give it the appearance of three fingers stretched out at the same time to point out a single object, there is no argument that would justify us in dividing this history into various dates. The Evangelists agree in relating, that while Christ, at the request of <em>a ruler of the synagogue, </em>was coming to his house, a woman on the road was secretly cured of <em>a bloody flux </em>by <em>touching his cloak; </em>and that afterwards Christ came into the ruler’s house, and raised a dead young woman to life. There is no necessity, I think, for circuitous language to prove that all the three relate the same event. Let us now come to details. </p><p><em>Lo, a certain ruler. </em>Though it is evident from the other two, that his confidence had not advanced so far as to hope that his daughter’s life could be restored, there is no room to doubt that, after having been reproved by Christ, he entertained a stronger hope than when he left his house. But Matthew, as we have said, studies brevity, and puts down at the very beginning of his narrative what took place at various times. The manner in which the history must be arranged is this: <em>Jairus </em>first requested that his daughter might be cured of her disease, and afterwards that she might be restored from death to life; that is, after that Christ had given him courage to do so. <em>Worship, </em>or <em>adoration, </em>is here put for k<em>neeling, </em>as is evident from the words of Mark and Luke: for Jairus did not render divine honor to Christ, <span class="cite-ref">(527)</span> but treated him with respect as a prophet of God; and we all know how common a practice <em>kneeling </em>was among eastern nations. </p><p><em>Come and lay thy hand. </em>We have here a bright mirror in which the divine condescension towards us is beheld. If you compare the <em>ruler of the synagogue </em>with the centurion, who was a heathen, (<span class="bvs">Mat_8:5</span>,) you will say that the full brightness of faith shone in the centurion, while scarcely the smallest portion of it was visible in the <em>ruler </em>He ascribes to Christ no power except through his touching the person; and, when he has received information of her death, he trembles as if there were no farther remedy. We see, then, that his faith was feeble and nearly exhausted. Yet Christ yields to his prayers, and encourages him to expect a favorable result, and thus proves to us that his faith, however small it might be, was not wholly rejected. Though we have not such abundance of faith as might be desired, there is no reason why our weakness should drive away or discourage us from prayer. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(527)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car Jairus ne pretendoit pas d'attribuer a Christ un honneur appar-tenant a la majeste Divine</span>;” — “for Jairus did not profess to ascribe to Christ an honor belonging to the Divine majesty.” </p></div></div>
