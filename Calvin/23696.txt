<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Get thee behind me, Satan. </em>It is idle to speculate, as some have done, about the word ( <span class="lang el-gr">ὀπίσω</span>) <em>behind; </em>as if Peter were ordered to follow, and not to go before; for, in a passage which we have already considered, Luke ( <span class="bvs">Luk_4:8</span>) informs us that our Lord used those very words in repelling the attacks of Satan, and the verb <span class="lang el-gr">ὕπαγε</span> (from which the Latin word <em>Apage </em>is derived) signifies to <em>withdraw </em><span class="cite-ref">(460)</span> Christ therefore throws his disciple to a distance from him, because, in his inconsiderate zeal, he acted the part of <em>Satan; </em>for he does not simply call him <em>adversary</em>, but gives him the name of the devil, as an expression of the greatest abhorrence. </p><p><em>Thou art an offense to me; for thou relishest not those things which are of God, but those which are of men. </em>We must attend to this as the reason assigned by our Lord for sending Peter away from him. Peter was <em>an offense </em>to Christ, so long as he opposed his calling; for, when Peter attempted to stop the course of his Master, it was not owing to him that he did not deprive himself and all mankind of eternal salvation. This single word, therefore, shows with what care we ought to avoid every thing that withdraws us from obedience to God. And Christ opens up the original source of the whole evil, when he says that Peter <em>relishes those things which are of men. </em><span class="cite-ref">(461)</span> Lest we and our intentions should be sent away by our heavenly Judge to the devil, <span class="cite-ref">(462)</span> let us learn not to be too much attached to our own views, but submissively to embrace whatever the Lord approves. Let the Papists now go and extol their notions to the skies. They will one day learn, when they appear before the judgment-seat of God, what is the value of their boasting, which Christ declares to be from <em>Satan </em>And with regard to ourselves, if we do not, of our own accord, resolve to shut ourselves out from the way of salvation by deadly obstacles, let us not desire to be wise in any other manner than from the mouth of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(460)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le mot Grec signifie simplement se reculer et s’en aller</span>;” — “the Greek word simply means <em>to withdraw and go away</em>. <em>” </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(461)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Pierre s’arreste a la sagesse de l’homme</span>;” — “that Peter rests satisfied with the wisdom of man.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(462)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et pourtant de peur que le Iuge celeste ne nous renvoye au diable avec nos bonnes affections et intentions</span>;” — “and then lest our heavenly Judge should send us away to the devil with our good feelings and intentions.” </p></div></div>
