<div class="comment-content"><p>Now the Prophet subjoins, <em>I will send fire unto the house of Hazael, which will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. </em>The Prophet speaks still of the kingdom of Syria; for we know that both Ben-hadad and Hazael were kings of Syria. But Jerome is much mistaken, who thinks that Ben-hadad was here put in the second place, as if he had been the successor of Hazael, <span class="cite-ref">(19)</span> while sacred history relates that Hazael came to Elisha when Ben-hadad was ill in his bed, (<span class="bvs">2Kg_8:9</span>;) and he was sent to request an answer. Now the Prophet declared that Hazael would be the king of Syria, and declared this not without tears; for he pitied his own people, of which this Syrian would be the destroyer. After he returned home, he strangled Ben-hadad, and took to himself the royal dignity. But it is common enough in Scripture to speak of a thing present, and then, as in this place, to add what has past, <em>I will send fire into the house of Hazael, and this fire will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad; </em>as though he said, “I will destroy the kingdom of Syria, I will consume it as with burning.” But he first names the house of Hazael, and then the palaces of Ben-hadad; as though he said, “No ancientness shall preserve that kingdom from being destroyed.” For, metaphorically, under the word fire, he designates every kind of consumption; and we know how great is the violence of fire. It is then as though he said, that no wealth, no strength, no fortifications, would stand in the way to prevent the kingdom of Syria from being destroyed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(19)</span> There were two Ben-hadads: the one whom Hazael strangled, <span class="bvs">2Kg_8:15</span>; and his son who succeeded him, <span class="bvs">2Kg_13:3</span>. But ben-hadad seems to have been the name of many of the kings of Syria, as Pharaoh was the common name of the kings of Egypt. Hence <em>the palaces of Ben-ha-dad </em>were probably those built by several kings of that name. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
