<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>54.</strong><em>How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled? </em>By this expression Christ means, that he ought not to attempt any method of escaping death, to which he knew that he was called by the Father. For himself, indeed, he had no need of <em>the Scriptures </em>to inform him that God had appointed that he should die at that time; but because mortals do not know what God has determined to do until it be revealed by his word, Christ, with a view to his disciples, properly refers to the testimony which God gave of his will. We know that whatever affliction happens to us, it is inflicted by God himself; but since we are uncertain as to the result, when we seek remedies which he allows, we do not rise against his government; but when his will has been ascertained, nothing more remains for us than to acquiesce. Though in this passage Christ teaches nothing more than that he ought patiently to suffer death, because <em>the Scriptures </em>have declared that it must be so, yet the use of this doctrine is evidently more extensive, namely, that Scripture is a sufficient bridle for subduing the rebellion of the flesh; because God points out to us what is his. will for the very purpose of keeping us in subjection to his will. Accordingly, Paul ascribes to <em>Scripture </em>this office, that it trains us <em>to patience, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_15:4</span>,) and supplies us with all the comfort that we need in adversity. His reproof of the disciples, as given by Luke, is more brief, <em>Permit them to do thus far; </em>but still he severely condemns their presumption, in having gone so far as to perform an unlawful action, though at the same time he holds out a hope of pardon, if they suppress their improper zeal, and proceed no farther. </p></div>
