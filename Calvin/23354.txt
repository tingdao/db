<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_8:8</span><strong>.</strong><em>Lord, I do not deserve that thou shouldest come under my roof </em>Matthew’s narrative is more concise, and represents the man as saying this; while Luke explains more fully, that this was a message sent by his friends: but the meaning of both is the same. There are two leading points in this discourse. The centurion, sparing Christ by way of honoring him, requests that Christ will <em>not trouble himself, </em>because he reckons himself unworthy to receive a visit from him. The next point is, that he ascribes to Christ such power as to believe, that by the mere expression of his will, and by a word, his servant may recover and live. There was astonishing humility in exalting so highly above himself a man who belonged to a conquered and enslaved nation. It is possible, too, that he had become accustomed to the haughty pretensions of the Jews, and, being a modest man, did not take it ill to be reckoned a heathen, and therefore feared that he would dishonor a Prophet of God, if he pressed him to enter the house of a polluted Gentile. However that may be, it is certain that he speaks sincerely, and entertains such reverence for Christ, that he does not venture to invite him to his house, nay, as is afterwards stated by Luke, he reckoned himself unworthy to converse with him. <span class="cite-ref">(502)</span></p><p>But it may be asked, what moved him to speak of Christ in such lofty terms? The difficulty is even increased by what immediately follows, <em>only say the word, and my servant will be healed, </em>or, as Luke has it, <em>say in a word: </em>for if he had not acknowledged Christ to be the Son of God, to transfer the glory of God to a man would have been superstition. It is difficult to believe, on the other hand, that he was properly informed about Christ’s divinity, of which almost all were at that time ignorant. Yet Christ finds no fault with his words, <span class="cite-ref">(503)</span> but declares that they proceeded from faith: and this reason has forced many expositors to conclude, that the centurion bestows on Christ the title of the true and only God. I rather think that the good man, having been informed about the uncommon and truly divine works of Christ, simply acknowledged in him the power of God. Something, too, he had undoubtedly heard about the promised Redeemer. Though he does not distinctly understand that Christ is <em>God manifested in the flesh, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:16</span>,) yet he is convinced that the power of God is manifested in him, and that he has received a commission to display the presence of God by miracles. He is not therefore chargeable with superstition, as if he had ascribed to a man what is the prerogative of God: but, looking at the commission which God had given to Christ, he believes that by a word alone he can heal his servant. </p><p>Is it objected, that nothing belongs more peculiarly to God than to accomplish by a word whatever he pleases, and that this supreme authority cannot without sacrilege be yielded to a mortal man? The reply is again easy. Though the centurion did not enter into those nice distinctions, he ascribed this power to the word, not of a mortal man, but of God, whose minister he fully believed Christ to be: on that point he entertained no doubt. The grace of healing having been committed to Christ, <span class="cite-ref">(504)</span> he acknowledges that this is a heavenly power, and does not look upon it as inseparable from the bodily presence, but is satisfied with the word, from which he believes such a power to proceed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(502)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ne s'est pas estime digne d'aller parler a Christ</span>;” — “he did not think himself worthy to go and talk to Christ.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(503)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Toutefois Christ ne prend pas ces paroles comme dites de l'aventure et sans intelligence</span>.” — “Yet Christ does not take these words as spoken at random and without understanding.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(504)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource que Christ avoit receu la vertu de donner gairison</span>;”— “because Christ had received the power of giving healing.” </p></div></div>
