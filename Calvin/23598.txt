<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>58.</strong><em>And he did not perform many miracles in that place. Mark </em>states it more emphatically, that <em>he could not perform any miracle. </em>But they are perfectly agreed as to the substance of what is said, that it was the impiety of Christ’s countrymen that closed the door against the performance of a greater number of miracles among them. He had already given them some taste of his power; but they willingly stupify themselves, so as to have no relish for it. Accordingly, <em>Augustine </em>justly compares faith to the open mouth of a vessel, while he speaks of faith as resembling a stopper, by which the vessel is closed, so as not to receive the liquor <span class="cite-ref">(349)</span> which God pours into it. And undoubtedly this is the case; for when the Lord perceives that his power is not accepted by us, he at length withdraws it; and yet we complain that we are deprived of his aid, which our unbelief rejects and drives far from us. </p><p>When <em>Mark </em>declares that Christ <em>could not perform any miracles, </em>he represents the aggravated guilt of those by whom his goodness was prevented; for certainly unbelievers, as far as lies in their power, bind up the hands of God by their obstinacy; not that God is overcome, as if he were an inferior, but because they do not permit him to display his power. We must observe, however, what <em>Mark </em>adds, that <em>some sick people, </em>notwithstanding, <em>were cured; </em>for hence we infer, that the goodness of Christ strove with their malice, and triumphed over every obstacle. <span class="cite-ref">(350)</span> We have experience of the same thing daily with respect to God; for, though he justly and reluctantly restrains his power, because the entrance to us is shut against him, yet we see that he opens up a path for himself where none exists, and ceases not to bestow favors upon us. What an amazing contest, that while we are endeavoring by every possible method to hinder the grace of God from coming to us, it rises victorious, and displays its efficacy in spite of all our exertions! </p><p><strong>(349)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La bonne liqueur</span>;” — “the good liquor.” </p><p><strong>(350)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En sorte que quelques empeschemens qu’ils ayent scen y mettre, encore est—elle venue au dessus, et s’est monstree en quelque maniere</span>.” —”So that, whatever obstacles they might be able to throw in the way, still it rose above them, and was in some measure displayed.” </p></div>
