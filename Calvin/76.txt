<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>And Adam called, etc</em>. There are two ways in which this may be read. The former, in the <em>pluperfect </em>tense, ‘Adam had called.’ If we follow this reading, the sense of Moses will be, that Adam had been greatly deceived, in promising <em>life </em>to himself and to his posterity, from a wife, whom he afterwards found by experience to be the introducer of <em>death</em>. And Moses (as we have seen) is accustomed, without preserving the order of the history, to subjoin afterwards things which had been prior in point of time. If, however we read the passage in the <em>preterite </em>tense, it may be understood either in a good or bad sense. There are those who think that Adam, animated by the hope of a more happy condition, because God had promised that the head of the serpent should be wounded by the seed of the woman, called her by a name implying life.’ <span class="cite-ref">(210)</span> This would be a noble and even heroic fortitude of mind; since he could not, without an arduous and difficult struggle, deem <em>her </em>the mother of the living, who, before any man could have been born, had involved all in eternal destruction. But, because I fear lest this conjecture should be weak, let the reader consider whether Moses did not design rather to tax Adam with thoughtlessness, who being himself immersed in death, yet gave to his wife so proud a name. Nevertheless, I do not doubt that, when he heard the declaration of God concerning the prolongation of life, he began again to breathe and to take courage; and then, as one revived, he gave his wife a name derived from <em>life</em>; but it does not follow, that by a faith accordant with the word of God, he triumphed, as he ought to have done, over death. I therefore thus expound the passage; as soon as he had escaped present death, being encouraged by a measure of consolation, he celebrated that divine benefit which, beyond all expectation, he had received, in the name he gave his wife. <span class="cite-ref">(211)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(210)</span> “Vocasse eam vivificam.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(211)</span> It is probable, however, that more than this is here meant. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">חוה</span>, (<em>chavah</em>,) Eve, is in the Septuagint rendered <span class="lang el-gr">ζωή</span>, <em>life</em>; and, as Fagius observes, Adam comforted himself in his wife, because he should, through Eve, produce a posterity in which (as parents in their children) they should be permanently victorious. — Pol.
