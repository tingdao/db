<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>The Son of man came. </em>To <em>eat and drink </em>means here nothing more than to live in the customary way; as Christ says that John <em>came neither eating nor drinking, </em>because he confined himself to a peculiar diet, and even abstained from ordinary food. This is more fully expressed by the words of Luke, <em>neither eating bread nor drinking wine. </em>Those who think that the highest perfection consists in outward austerity of life, and who pronounce it to be an angelical life when a person is abstemious, <span class="cite-ref">(26)</span> or mortifies himself by fasting, ought to attend to this passage. On this principle John would rank higher than the Son of God; but, on the contrary, we ought to maintain, that </p><p>bodily exercise profiteth little, but godliness <LineBreak />is profitable to all things, (<span class="bvs">1Ti_4:8</span>.) </p><p>And yet we must not make this a pretense for giving a loose rein to the flesh, by indulging in luxuries and effeminacy: only we must beware of superstition, lest foolish men, imagining that perfection lies in matters of a purely elementary nature, neglect the spiritual worship of God. Besides, while Christ accommodated himself to the usages of ordinary life, he maintained a sobriety truly divine, and did not encourage the excesses of others by his dissimulation or by his example. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(26)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand un homme ne boira point de vin</span>;” — “when a person will drink no wine.” </p></div></div>
