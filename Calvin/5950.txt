<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, </em>etc To give additional sanctity to the vision, the great Angel requires as a sign of reverence and fear that Joshua put off his shoes. Moses relates, (<span class="bvs">Exo_3:5</span>) that the same command was given to him on Mount Sinai, and for no other reason than that the Lord there manifested his glory. For one place cannot have a greater sanctity than another, except God deigns specially to make it so. Thus Jacob exclaims, (<span class="bvs">Gen_28:17</span><span class="cite-ref">(60)</span>) that the place where he had known God more nearly is the house of God, a dreadful place, and the gate of heaven. Here, therefore, when God orders his holy servant to take off his shoes, he by this ceremony attests the reality of his presence, and adds more weight to the vision; not that nakedness of feet is of itself of any value in the worship of God, but because the weakness of men requires to be aided by helps of this kind, that they may the better excite and prepare themselves for veneration. Moreover, as God by his presence sanctifies the places in which he appears, I think it probable that the expression, holy ground, is in part commendatory of the excellence of the land of Canaan, which God had chosen for his own habitation and the seat of his pure worship. Hence in various passages it is called “his rest.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_95:11</span>, and <span class="bvs">Psa_132:14</span><span class="cite-ref">(61)</span>) In the end of the verse Joshua is praised for his obedience, that posterity might learn by his example to cultivate pure piety in that land. There seems thus to be a kind of tacit comparison or antithesis, by which the land of Canaan is extolled above all other countries. <span class="cite-ref">(62)</span></p><p><strong>(60)</strong> The original text had the reference to <span class="bvs">Gen_26:17</span>, an obvious typesetting error. —<em>fj. </em></p><p><strong>(61)</strong> The original text had the reference to <span class="bvs">Psa_132:11</span>, an obvious typesetting error. —<em>fj. </em></p><p><strong>(62)</strong> The incident here recorded is one of the principal reasons from the designation of the Holy Land usually applied to Palestine. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
