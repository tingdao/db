<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>And Joseph was the governor </em><span class="cite-ref">(164)</span><em>over the land</em>. Moses connects the honor of Joseph with his fidelity and diligence. For although he was possessed of supreme authority, he nevertheless submitted to every possible laborious service, just as if he had been a hired servant. From which example we must learn, that as any one excels in honor, he is bound to be the more fully occupied in business; but that they who desire to combine leisure with dignity, utterly pervert the sacred order of God. Let it be, moreover, understood, that the corn was sold by Joseph, not as if he measured it out with his own hands, or himself received the money for it, seeing that it was set to sale in many parts of the kingdom, and he could scarcely have attended to one single storehouse: but that the whole of the stores were under his power. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(164)</span><span class="lang he-il">השליט</span> (<em>Hashalit</em>) “Of the Hebrew Shallet and Shilton, is made in Arabic the name Sultan, a title whereby the chief rulers of Egypt and Babylon are still called.” — <em>Ainsworth</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
