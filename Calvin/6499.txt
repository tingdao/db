<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And Joshua said unto the people, </em>etc We now understand what the object was at which Joshua had hitherto aimed. It was not to terrify the people and make them fall away from their religion, but to make the obligation more sacred by their having of their own accord chosen his government, and betaken themselves to his guidance, that they might live under his protection. They acknowledge, therefore, that their own conscience will accuse them, and hold them guilty of perfidy, if they prove unfaithful. <span class="cite-ref">(203)</span> But although they were not insincere in declaring that they would be witnesses to their own condemnation, still how easily the remembrance of this promise faded away, is obvious from the Book of Judges. For when the more aged among them had died, they quickly turned aside to various superstitions. By this example we are taught how multifarious are the fallacies which occupy the senses of men, and how tortuous the recesses in which they hide their hypocrisy and folly, while they deceive themselves by vain confidence. <span class="cite-ref">(204)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(203)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Leur propre conscience les redarguera comme coulpables et conveincus de desloyaute, et d’avoir fausse leur foy, s’ils ne tiennent leur promesse</span>;” “Their own conscience will condemn them as guilty and convicted of disloyalty, and as having broken their faith, if they do not keep their promise.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(204)</span> The French adds, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme s’il n’y avoit rien a redire en eux</span>;” “As if there was nothing to gainsay in them.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
