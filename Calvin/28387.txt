<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Both Greeks and Jews </em>He shows by this contrast, that the fact that Christ was so unfavorably received, was not owing to any fault on his part, nor to the natural disposition of mankind generally, but arose from the depravity of those who were not enlightened by God, inasmuch as the elect of God, whether Jews or Gentiles, are not hindered by any <em>stumblingblock </em>from coming to Christ, that they may find in him a sure salvation. He contrasts <em>power </em>with the <em>stumblingblock</em>, that was occasioned by abasement, and <em>wisdom </em>he contrasts with <em>folly </em>The sum, then, is this: — “I am aware that nothing except signs has effect upon the obstinacy of the Jews, and that nothing soothes down the haughtiness of the Greeks, except an empty show of wisdom. We ought, however, to make no account of this; because, however our Christ in connection with the abasement of his cross is a <em>stumblingblock </em>to the Jews, and is derided by the Greeks, he is, notwithstanding, to all the elect, of whatever nation they may be, at once <em>the power of God unto salvation </em>for surmounting these <em>stumblingblocks</em>, and the <em>wisdom of God </em>for throwing off that mask.” <span class="cite-ref">(94)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(94)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour oster et faire esvanoir ceste vaine apparence, et masque de sagesse</span>;” — “For taking away and causing to vanish, that empty show and mask of wisdom.” </p></div></div>
