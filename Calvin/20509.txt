<div class="comment-content"><p>Now he adds, <em>not to many peoples </em>Those who translate <em>“many” </em>by <em>“great,” </em>do not understand the Prophet’s meaning, for God had spoken in the singular number concerning all people, but now he uses the plural, as if he had said, I send thee neither to Egyptians, nor to Chaldeans, nor to any other remote nation, since the world is on all sides of thee, inhabited by peoples whose language thou dost not understand: to those therefore I do not send thee. The particle, <em>if not, </em>follows, and Jerome translates, “If I had sent thee unto them,” although the negative particle is interposed, literally, <em>if not, </em>but because this phrase appears harsh, some have supposed <span class="lang he-il">אם-לא</span>, <em>am-la, to </em>have the sense of swearing, and interpret it affirmatively for <span class="lang he-il">כאמת</span><em>, cameth, “truly,” </em>or “surely.” But if we receive it so, the passage will be defective; for they understand <span class="lang he-il">אם</span><em>, am, “again,” “afterwards:” </em>for these two words, <span class="lang he-il">אם-לא</span>, <em>am-la, </em>have the force of an oath interposed. What sense then shall we extract from the words, <em>“truly </em>I will send thee unto them, and they shall hear thee?” We see then this sense to be too forced. Some explain the passage thus: “If I had not sent thee unto them, they would have heard thee,” as if God here blamed the disposition of the people, because they rather sought vain and foolish prophecies:, than submitted themselves to the truth; just as if he had said, if any impostor should pour darkness upon them, they would immediately embrace his fables and lies, as they are so prone to foolishness. Since, therefore, I send thee, therefore they do not hear. But this explanation does not suit, because a little afterwards we shall see it in its own place. To me therefore this context is most probable, <em>if I had not sent thee to them, these also would have heard thee, </em>as if it had been said, unless a difference of speech had interposed, I had rather have used thine assistance with reference to foreign nations. In this way God signifies his displeasure, when he says, that he would rather send his Prophet hither and thither than to the Israelites, except through the want of a common language; for this difference of language presented the only boundary to the Prophet, so that he was confined to his own people. In this sense there is nothing forced. I <em>do not, </em>therefore, <em>send thee to many peoples, profound in speech and strange in tongue, because thou wouldst not understand their language </em>But if this had not been an obstacle, I would have sent thee, and they would have heard thee. We see then what I have just touched upon, that the Israelites are compared to foreign or uncircumcised tribes, because they rejected the instruction offered them, not through ignorance of the language, but through the hardness of their heart. Isaiah also says, (<span class="bvs">Isa_28:11</span>,) that the word of God would be deep and obscure to even the Jews themselves, but in another sense; he also compares his prophecies to a sealed book, since God had blinded them according to their deserts. Since therefore they were so given over to a reprobate mind, and were destitute of sound understanding, therefore he says, that his teaching would be like a closed and sealed book: then he says, that he would be a barbarian, as if he was using an unknown language. So God in this place clearly shows that the house of Israel were suffering no impediment in profiting by his word, except their own unwillingness to hear. (<span class="bvs">Isa_8:16</span>; <span class="bvs">Isa_29:11</span>.) For he says, that the heathen would be obedient, if they could be partakers of such a benefit. Unless therefore the language of the Prophet had been unknown to the profane and uncircumcised heathen, he had there found attentive and obedient disciples, as God testifies. How then comes it to pass that the house of Israel cannot hear! It now follows, <em>But the house of Israel are unwilling to hear, </em>that is, the house of Israel is unwilling to hear thee, because it will not hear me, says he. </p></div>
