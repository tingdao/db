<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>But to do good, etc. </em>Here he points out even another way of offering a due and regular sacrifice, for all the acts and duties of love are so many sacrifices; and he thereby intimates that they were foolish and absurd in their wishes who thought that something was wanting except they offered beasts to God according to the Law, since God gave them many and abundant opportunities for sacrificing. For though he can derive no benefit from us, yet he regards prayer a sacrifice, and so much as the chief sacrifice, that it alone can supply the place of all the rest; and then, whatever benefits we confer on men he considers as done to himself, and honors them with the name of sacrifices. So it appears that the elements of the Law are now not only superfluous, but do harm, as they draw us away from the right way of sacrificing. </p><p>The meaning is, that if we wish to sacrifice to God, we must call on him and acknowledge his goodness by thanksgiving, and further, that we must do good to our brethren; these are the true sacrifices which Christians ought to offer; and as to other sacrifices, there is neither time nor place for them. </p><p><em>For with such sacrifices God is well pleased. </em>There is to be understood here an implied contrast, — that he no longer requires those ancient sacrifices which he had enjoined until the abrogation of the Law. </p><p>But with this doctrine is connected an exhortation which ought powerfully to stimulate us to exercise kindness towards our neighbors; for it is not a common honor that God should regard the benefits we confer on men as sacrifices offered to himself, and that he so adorns our works, which are nothing worth, as to pronounce them holy and sacred things, acceptable to him. When, therefore, love does not prevail among us, we not only rob men of their right, but God himself, who has by a solemn sentence dedicated to himself what he has commanded to be done to men. </p><p>The word <em>communicate </em>has a wider meaning than <em>to do good, </em>for it embraces all the duties by which men can mutually assist one another; and it is a true mark or proof of love, when they who are united together by the Spirit of God communicate to one another. <span class="cite-ref">(286)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(286)</span> The words may be thus rendered, “And forget not benevolence (or, literally, well-doing) and liberality.” The<span class="lang el-gr">δὲ </span> here should be rendered “and,” for this is enjoined in addition to what is stated in the previous verse. The word<span class="lang el-gr">εὐποιΐα </span> means kindness, benevolence, beneficence, the doing of good generally; but<span class="lang el-gr">κοινωνία </span> refers to the distribution of what is needful for the poor. See <span class="bvs">Rom_15:26</span>, <span class="bvs">2Co_9:13</span>. So that Calvin in this instance has reserved their specific meaning. Stuart’s version is “Forget not kindness also and liberality;” and he explains the clause thus, “Beneficence or kindness toward the suffering and liberality toward the needy.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
