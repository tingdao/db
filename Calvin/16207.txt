<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Who smote the Egyptians in, their first-born </em>Some read <em>with their first-born, </em>but the other rendering reads better. As we do not mean to sermonize upon the passage, it is unnecessary to detain the reader here with many words, as nothing is mentioned but what has been treated elsewhere. Only we may notice that the Egyptians are well said to have been smitten in their first-born, because they continued in their outrageous obstinacy under the other plagues, though occasionally terrified by them, but were broken and subdued by this last plague, and submitted. As it was not intended to recount all the wonders successively done in Egypt, the whole is summed up in one word when it is said, that he led his people forth from the midst of it with a mighty and a stretched out arm. For pressed down as they were on every side, it was only by a wonderful display of divine power that they could effect an escape. The figure of <em>an outstretched arm </em>is appropriate, for we stretch out the arm when any great effort is required; so that this implies that God put forth an extraordinary and not a common or slight display of his power in redeeming his people. <span class="cite-ref">(175)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(175)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Dieu en deliverant son peuple n’a point monstre une petite puissance</span>,” etc. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
