<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>And returning in the morning. </em>Between that solemn entrance of Christ, of which we have spoken, and the day of the Passover, he had passed the night in Bethany; and during the day he appeared in the temple for the purpose of teaching. Matthew and Mark relate what happened during that interval, that Christ, when <em>coming into the city, was hungry, </em>approached <em>a fig-tree, </em>and, <em>having found nothing on it but leaves, cursed it; </em>and that the tree, which had been <em>cursed </em>by his voice, <em>immediately withered. </em>I take for granted that Christ did not pretend hunger, but <em>was </em>actually <em>hungry; </em>for we know that he voluntarily became subject to the infirmities of the flesh, though by nature he was free and exempt from them. </p><p>But here lies the difficulty. How was he mistaken in seeking fruit on a tree that had none; more especially, when the season of fruit had not yet arrived? And again, Why was he so fiercely enraged against a harmless tree? But there would be no absurdity in saying, that as man, he did not know <span class="cite-ref">(21)</span> the kind of tree; though it is possible that he approached it on purpose, with full knowledge of the result. Certainly it was not the fury of passion that led him to curse the tree, (for that would not only have been an unjust, but even a childish and ridiculous revenge;) but as hunger was troublesome to him according to the feeling of the flesh, he determined to overcome it by an opposite affection; that is, by a desire to promote the glory of the Father, as he elsewhere says, </p><p>My meat is to do the will of my Father, (<span class="bvs">Joh_4:34</span>;) </p><p>for at that time he was contending both with fatigue and with hunger. I am the more inclined to this conjecture, because hunger gave him an opportunity of performing a miracle and of teaching his disciples. So when he was pressed by hunger, and there was no food at hand, he finds a repast in another way; that is, by promoting the glory of God. He intended, however, to present in this tree an outward sign of the end which awaits hypocrites, and at the same time to expose the emptiness and folly of their ostentation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(21)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’a pas cognu de loin</span>;” — “he did not know at a distance.” </p></div></div>
