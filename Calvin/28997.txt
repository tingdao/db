<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>I robbed other churches </em>He has intentionally, in my opinion, made use of an offensive term, that he might the more forcibly express the unreasonableness of the matter — in respect of his being despised by the Corinthians. “I have,” says he, “procured pay for myself from the <em>spoils </em>of others, that I might serve you. While I have thus spared you, how unreasonable it is to make me so poor a return!” It is, however, a metaphor, that is taken from what is customary among soldiers; for as conquerors take <em>spoils </em>from the nations that they have conquered, so every thing that Paul took from the Churches that he had gained to Christ was, in a manner, the <em>spoils </em>of his victories, though, at the same time, he never would have taken it from persons against their will, but what they contributed gratuitously was, in a manner, due by right of spiritual warfare. <span class="cite-ref">(825)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(825)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>The word <span class="lang el-gr">ἐσύλησα,</span> rendered in our authorized version <em>robbed, </em>is derived from <span class="lang el-gr">σύλη,</span><em>spoils, </em>and comes originally from the Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">שלל</span> (<em>shalal</em>)<em>, </em>which is frequently employed to denote <em>spoiling, </em>or <em>making booty. </em>(See <span class="bvs">Isa_10:6</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_29:19</span>.) — “The word <span class="lang el-gr">ἐσύλησα,</span> ” says <em>Barnes, </em>“means properly, ‘I spoiled, plundered, robbed,’ but the idea of Paul here is, that he, <em>as it were, </em>robbed them, because he did not render an equivalent for what they gave him. They supported him, when he was labouring for another people. A conqueror who plunders a country gives <em>no equivalent </em>for what he takes. In this sense only could Paul say, that he had plundered the Church at Philippi. His general principle was, that ’the labourer was worthy of his hire;’ and that a man was to receive his support from the people for whom he labored, (See <span class="bvs">1Co_9:7</span>,) but this rule he had not observed in this case.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
