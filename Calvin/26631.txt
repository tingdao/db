<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Before the feast of the passover. </em>John intentionally passes by many things which, he knew, had been related by Matthew and others. He undertakes to explain those circumstances which they had left out, one of which was the narrative of the <em>washing of feet</em>. And though he will afterwards explain more clearly for what purpose Christ <em>washed the feet </em>of his disciples, yet, before doing so, he states, in a single word, that the Lord testified, by this visible sign, that the love with which he embraced them was firm and lasting; that, though they were deprived of his presence, they might still be convinced that death itself would not quench this love. This conviction ought now to be fixed also in our hearts. </p><p>The words are, that Christ <em>loved even to the end his own, who were in the world. </em>Why does he employ this circumlocution in describing the Apostles, but in order to inform us that, in consequence of their being engaged, as we are, in a hazardous and difficult warfare, Christ regarded them with so much the greater solicitude? And, therefore, though we think that we are at a distance from Christ, yet we ought to know that he is looking at us; for <em>he loveth his own</em>, <em>who are in the world</em>; for we, have no reason to doubt that he still bears the same affection which he retained at the very moment of his death. </p><p><em>To remove from this world to the Father. </em>This phrase is worthy of notice; for it refers to the knowledge of Christ, that he knew that his death was a <em>passage </em>to the heavenly kingdom of God. And if, while he was hastening thither, he did not cease to regard <em>his own </em>with his wonted love, there is no reason why we should now think that his affection is changed. Now, since he is the first-born from the dead, this definition of death applies to the whole body of the Church, that it is an opening or passage to go to God, from whom believers are now absent. <span class="cite-ref">(38)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(38)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que c’est une ouverture ou passage pour aller a Dieu</span>.” </p></div></div>
