<div class="comment-content"><p>He describes at large the calamities of Jerusalem. But it is no wonder that the Prophet, thus lengthened his discourse; for we know that those who are heavily oppressed never satisfy themselves with mourning and lamentations. If, indeed, we duly consider how great the evils were, the Prophet will not appear to us wordy, nor will his prolixity be wearisome to us. For when any one compares the flourishing state of Jerusalem with that desolate ruin which the Prophet laments, it will surely appear to him that no words, however many, can fully express what it really was; nay, though the expressions may seem hyperbolical, yet they do not exceed the greatness of that calamity. This point is briefly adverted to, lest any one should be wearied with those various modes of expression which the Prophet employs, when yet he might have at once said that Jerusalem was destroyed. </p><p>He says, <em>For this will I weep</em>. He throughout sustains the person of a woman; for Jerusalem herself speaks, and not Jeremiah. <em>I</em>, she says, <em>for this will weep; mine eye mine eye! it shall descend into waters</em>. Others read, “Waters will descend from mine eyes;” but such a rendering is too loose. I do not, then, doubt but that Jerusalem says that her eyes would be like fountains of waters. She indeed speaks in the singular number, and repeats the words, <em>mine eye! mine eye! it shall descend</em>, or flow as waters, that is, as though they were two fountains, <em>because alienated from me</em>, or far from me, <em>is a comforter, to revive my soul </em><span class="cite-ref">(142)</span> By these words she intimates that she was fainting, and as it were dying and that there was no one present to administer comfort, so that her soul might be revived. As it appeared before, that it is deemed an extreme evil when there is no friend to do the duty of humanity by alleviating sorrow; so now again Jerusalem repeats the same complaint, and says that all her <em>sons were destroyed, because the enemy had prevailed</em>. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(142)</strong> Though the <em>Sept</em>. and <em>Vulg. </em>do not repeat the “eye,” yet the <em>Targ</em>. has “my two eyes,” and the <em>Syr</em>. , “mine eyes.” The repetition is in most copies, and it is very emphatical. See a similar instance in <span class="bvs">Jer_4:9</span>. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>16.</strong>For these things I weep: mine eye! mine eye! it brings down water; For far from me is a comforter, a restorer of my life; <LineBreak />Become desolate are my sons, for the enemy has prevailed. </p><p>— <em>Ed </em></p></div>
