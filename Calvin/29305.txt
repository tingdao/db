He reminds us that we are the children of God, and that therefore we ought, as far as possible, to resemble Him in acts of kindness. It is impossible not to perceive, that the division of chapters, in the present instance, is particularly unhappy, as it has made a separation between parts of the subject which are very closely related. If, then, we are the children of God, we ought to be <em>followers of God. </em>Christ also declares, that, unless we shew kindness to the unworthy, we cannot be the children of our heavenly Father. </p><p>“Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you; <em>that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven</em>; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_5:44</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(153)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(153)</span> “To institute an action against one who has injured us is human; not to take revenge on him is the part of a philosopher; but to compensate him with benefits is divine, and makes men of earth followers of the Father who is in heaven.” — Clem.
