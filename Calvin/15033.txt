<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Behold! these are the ungodly. </em>The Psalmist here shows, as it were by a vivid pictorial representation, the character of that envy which had well nigh overthrown him. <em>Behold! </em>says he, <em>these are wicked men! </em>and yet they happily enjoy their ease and pleasures undisturbed, and are exalted to power and influence; and that not merely for a few days, but their prosperity is of long duration, and has, as it were, an endless course. And is there anything which seems to our judgment less reasonable than that persons whose wickedness is accounted infamous and detestable, even in the eyes of men, should be treated with such liberality and indulgence by God? Some here take the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">עולם</span>, <em>olam, </em>for <em>the world, </em>but improperly. It rather denotes in this passage <em>an age; </em><span class="cite-ref">(184)</span> and what David complains of is, that the prosperity of the wicked is stable and of long duration, and that to see it last so long wears out the patience of the righteous. Upon seeing the wicked so tenderly cherished by God, he descends to the consideration of his own case; and as his conscience bore him testimony that he had walked sincerely and uprightly, he reasons with himself as to what advantage he had derived from studiously devoting himself to the practice of righteousness, since he was afflicted and harassed in a very unusual degree. He tells us that he was <em>scourged daily, </em>and that as often as the sun rose, some affliction or other was prepared for him, so that there was no end to his calamities. In short the amount of his reasoning is this, “Truly I have labored in vain to obtain and preserve a pure heart and clean hands, seeing continued afflictions await me, and, so to speak, are on the watch to meet me at break of day. Such a condition surely shows that there is no reward for innocence before God, else he would certainly deal somewhat more compassionately towards those who serve him.” As the true holiness for which the godly are distinguished consists of two parts, first, of purity of heart, and, secondly, of righteousness in the outward conduct, David attributes both to himself. Let us learn, from his example, to join them together: let us, in the first place, begin with purity of heart, and then let us give evidence of this before men by uprightness and integrity in our conduct. </p><p><strong>(184)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Plustost il signifie yci un siecle</span>,” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
