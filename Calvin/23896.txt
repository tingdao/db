<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_22:23</span><strong>.</strong><em>The same day came to him the Sadducees. </em>We see here how Satan brings together all the ungodly, who in other respects differ widely from each other, to attack the truth of God. For, though deadly strife existed between these two sects, <span class="cite-ref">(66)</span> yet they conspire together against Christ; so that the Pharisees are not displeased to have their own doctrine attacked in the person of Christ. Thus in the present day, we see all the forces of Satan, though in other respects they are opposed to each other, rising on every hand against Christ. And so fierce is the hatred with which the Papists burn against the Gospel, that they willingly support Epicureans, Libertines, and other monsters of that description, provided that they can avail themselves of their aid for accomplishing its destruction. In short, we see that they come out of various camps to make an attack on Christ; and that this was done, because all of them alike hated the light of sound doctrine. Now <em>the Sadducees </em>propose a question to Christ, that by the appearance of absurdity they may either lead him to take part in their error, or, if he disagree with them, that they may hold him up to disgrace and ridicule among an uneducated and ignorant multitude. It is no doubt possible, that they had been formerly accustomed to employ this sophistry for harassing the Pharisees, but now they attempt to take Christ in the same snare. </p><p><em>Who say that there is no resurrection. </em>How the sect of <em>the Sadducees </em>originated we have explained under another passage. Luke assures us that they denied not only the final <em>resurrection </em>of the body, but also the immortality of the soul, (<span class="bvs">Act_23:8</span>.) And, indeed, if we consider properly the doctrine of Scripture, the life of the soul, apart from the hope of the <em>resurrection, </em>will be a mere dream; for God does not declare that, immediately after the death of the body, souls live, — as if their glory and happiness were already enjoyed by them in perfections — but delays the expectation of them till the last day. I readily acknowledge that the philosophers, who were ignorant of the <em>resurrection </em>of the body, have many discussions about the immortal essence of the soul; but they talk so foolishly about the state of the future life that their opinions have no weight. But since the Scriptures inform us that the spiritual life depends on the hope of the <em>resurrection, </em>and that souls, when separated from the bodies, look forward to it, whoever destroys the <em>resurrection </em>deprives souls also of their immortality. </p><p>Now this enables us to perceive the dreadful confusion of the Jewish Church, that their rulers <span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> in religious matters took away the expectation of a future life, so that, after the death of the body, men differed in no respect from brute beasts. They did not indeed deny that our lives ought to be holy and righteous, and were not so profane as to consider the worship of God to be superfluous; on the contrary, they maintained that God is the Judge of the world, and that the affairs of men are directed by His providence. But as the reward of the godly, and likewise the punishment due to the wicked, were limited by them to the present life, even though there had been truth in their assertion, that every man is now treated impartially according to his merit, <span class="cite-ref">(68)</span> yet it was excessively absurd to restrict the promises of God within such narrow limits. Now experience plainly shows that they were chargeable with the grossest stupidity, since it is manifest that the reward which is laid up for the good is left incomplete till another life, and likewise that the punishment of the wicked is not wholly inflicted in this world. </p><p>In short, it is impossible to conceive any thing more absurd than this dream, that men formed after the image of God are extinguished by death like the beasts. But how disgraceful and monstrous was it that while, among the profane and blind idolaters of all nations, some notion, at least, of a future life still lingered, among the Jews, the peculiar people of God, this seed of piety was destroyed. I do not mention that, when they saw that the holy fathers earnestly aspired to the heavenly life, and that the covenant which God had made with them was spiritual and eternal, they must have been worse than stupid who remained blind in the midst of such clear light. But, first, this was the just reward of those who had split the Church of God into sects; and, secondly, in this manner the Lord avenged the wicked contempt of His doctrine. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(66)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien que ces deux sectes se fissent tous les jours la guerre l’un contre l’autre</span>;” — “though those two sects were every day making war against each other.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(67)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Une partie des principaux chefs de la religion</span>;” — “a part of the chief leaders in religion.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(68)</span> "<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Dieu traitte yei un chacun selon qu'il a merite</span>;" — "That God here treats every one according as he has deserved." </p></div></div>
