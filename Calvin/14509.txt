<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18</strong>and <strong>19</strong><em>Surely I declare my iniquity. </em>By comparison, he amplifies what he had just said concerning the pride and the reproachful conduct of his enemies; for he says, that whilst he is lying in a filthy and wretched condition, like a wicked man, and one abandoned by God, they fly about in mirth and gladness, nay, they carry their heads high, because they are rich and powerful. But first, it is proper to notice in what sense it is that <em>he declares his sin. </em>Those, in my judgment, are mistaken, who understand this passage simply in the sense of a confession of his guilt before God, that he might obtain forgiveness. According to their interpretation, the Psalmist is supposed to repeat here what we have seen he said </p><p>“I acknowledged my sin unto thee, <LineBreak />and mine iniquity have I not hid.”— (<span class="bvs">Psa_32:5</span>) </p><p>But in this place he is not speaking so much of his repentance, as he is bewailing his sad and miserable condition; and, therefore, <em>sin </em>and <em>iniquity </em>are to be understood of the afflictions and chastisements which are the tokens of God’s wrath; as if he had said, that the hand of God was against him, and lying so heavily upon him, that from the very sight of the misery to which he was reduced, the world in general might regard him as a condemned and reprobate man. In order to render the meaning more obvious, the 18<span class="cite-ref">th</span> and 19<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verses must be read together, thus: <em>I declare my iniquity, and my enemies are living; I am dismayed because of my sin, but they are become strong. </em>I do not, however, deny that he regards the miseries to which he was subjected as proceeding from his sins. In this respect, the godly differ from the wicked, that, being admonished of their transgression by adversity, they humbly sist themselves before the judgment-seat of God. Accordingly, judging of the cause from the effects, he takes into account these two things: First, That thus overwhelmed and afflicted, he is lying under a heavy load of miseries; and, secondly, That all these evils are justly inflicted as chastisements for sin. </p></div>
