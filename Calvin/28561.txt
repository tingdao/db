<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Though not without law to God. </em>He wished by this parenthesis to soften the harshness of the expression, for it might. have seemed harsh at first view to have it said, that he <em>had come to be without law. </em>Hence in order that this might not be taken in a wrong sense, he had added, by way of correction, that he had always kept in view one law â€” that of subjection to Christ. By this too he hints that odium was excited against him groundlessly and unreasonably, as if he called men to an unbridled licentiousness, while he taught exemption from the bondage of the Mosaic law. Now he calls it expressly <em>the law of Christ</em>, in order to wipe away the groundless reproach, with which the false apostles branded the gospel, for he means, that in the doctrine of Christ nothing is omitted, that might serve to give us a perfect rule of upright. living. </p></div>
