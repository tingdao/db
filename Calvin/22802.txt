<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet in this verse expresses more clearly what I have already stated—That God would be the author of all the evils which would happen to the Jews; for as they grew more insensible in their sins, they more and more provoked God’s wrath against themselves. It is therefore no common wisdom to consider God’s hand when he strikes or chastens us. This is the reason why the Prophet now calls the attention of the Jews to God, that they might not fix their minds, as it is commonly done, on men only. At the same time, he tries to shake off their torpor by declaring that the day would be terrible, and that it was also now near at hand. We indeed know that hypocrites trifle with God, except they feel the weight of his wrath, and that they protract time, and promise themselves so long a respite, that they never awake to repentance. Hence the Prophet in the first place shows, that whatever evils then impended over the Jews were not only from men, but especially from God. This is one thing; and then, in order thoroughly to touch stupid hearts, he says, that <em>the day would be terrible</em>; and lastly, that they might not deceive themselves by vain flatteries, he declares that the day was at hand. These three things must be noticed in order that we understand the Prophet’s object. </p><p>But he says at the beginning of the verse, that <em>the great day of Jehovah was nigh</em>. In these words he includes the three things to which I have already referred. By calling it the <em>day of Jehovah</em>, he means, that whatever evils the Jews suffered, ought to have been ascribed to his judgment; and by calling it <em>the great day</em>, his object was to strike terror; as well as by saying, in the third place, that it was nigh. We hence see that three things are included in these words. But the Prophet more fully explains what might, on account of the brevity of his words, have seemed not quite clear. </p><p>Near, he says, <em>is the day, and quickly hastens</em>. Men, we know, are wont to extend time, that they may cherish their sins; for though they cannot divest themselves of every feeling as to religion, or shake it off, they yet imagine for themselves a long distance between them and God; and by such an imagination they find ease for themselves. Hence the Prophet declares <em>the day </em>to be <em>nigh</em>; and as it was hardly credible that the destruction of which he spake was near, he adds, that the day was <em>quickly hastening</em>; as though he had said, that they ought not to judge by the present state of things what God would do, for in a moment his wrath would pass through from east to west like lightning. Men need long preparation when they determine to execute their vengeance; but God has no need of much preparation, for his own power is sufficient for him when he resolves to destroy the wicked. We now, then, see why it was added by the Prophet, that the day would quickly hasten. </p><p>He now repeats that the <em>day of Jehovah </em>and <em>his voice would cry out bitterly</em>. I have stated three renderings as given by interpreters. Some read thus—The day of Jehovah shall be bitter; there the strong shall cry aloud. This meaning is admissible, and a useful instruction may from it be elicited; as though the Prophet had said, that no courage could bring help to men, or be an aid to them, against God’s vengeance. Others give this rendering, that the day would bitterly cry out, for there would be the strong, that is, the strength of enemies would break down whatever courage the Jews might have. But this second meaning seems forced; and I am disposed to adopt the third—that the voice of the day of Jehovah would bitterly cry out. And he means the voice of those who would have really to know God as a judge, whom they had previously despised; for God would then put forth his power, which had been an object of contempt, until the Jews had by experience felt it. <span class="cite-ref">(82)</span></p><p>As to the Prophet’s design, there is no ambiguity: for he seeks here to rouse the Jews from their insensibility, who had so hardened themselves against all threatening, that the Prophets were not able to convince them. Since, then, they had thus hardened themselves against every instruction and all warnings, the Prophet here says, that the voice of God’s day would be different: for God’s voice had sounded through the mouth of the Prophets, but it availed not with the deaf. An awful change is here announced; for the Jews shall then cry aloud, as the roaring of the divine voice shall then terrify them, when God shall really show that he is the avenger of wickedness—When therefore he shall ascend his tribunal, then ye shall cry. His messengers now cry to you in vain, for ye close up your ears; ye shall cry in your turn, but it will be in vain. </p><p>But if one prefers to take it as one sentence, The voice of the day of Jehovah, there strong, shall bitterly cry out, the meaning will be the same as to the main point. I would not, therefore, contend about words, provided we bear in mind what I have already said—that Zephaniah sets here the cry of the distressed people in opposition to the voices of the Prophets, which they had despised, yea, and for the most part, as it appears from other places, treated with ridicule. However this may have been, he indirectly condemns their false confidence, when he speaks of the strong; as though he had said, that they were strong only for their own ruin, while they opposed God and his servants; for this strength falls at length, nay, it breaks itself by its own weight, when God rises to judgment. It follows— </p><p><strong>(82)</strong> The Rabbinical punctuation has destroyed the simplicity of this passage by connecting "bitter” with the latter clause. <em>Jerome, Pagninus</em>, <em>Newcome</em>, as well as the <em>Septuagint</em>, connect it with the former clause. The literal rendering of the two lines is as follows— </p><p>The voice of the day of Jehovah shall be grievous; <LineBreak />Roar out there (or then) shall the brave. </p><p>“The voice of the day,” etc., means the voice uttered on that day, as <em>Drusius </em>explains it. [<span class="lang he-il">מר</span> ] is no doubt “bitter;” but it is often applied in scripture to express what is grievous, afflictive, or sorrowful. If we render [<span class="lang he-il">שט</span> ], “there,” it refers to Jerusalem, verse 12; but it is sometimes used as an adverb of time, “then,” see <span class="bvs">Psa_14:5</span>; <span class="bvs">Neh_3:15</span>. “The meaning is,” says <em>Drusius</em>, “that the voice of that day, which they who excel in strength of mind and body shall utter, shall be bitter.” The whole verse is remarkably concise and emphatical,— </p><p>14.<em>Nigh is the great day of Jehovah, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Nigh and hastening quickly: </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>The voice of the day of Jehovah shall be grievous; </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Roar out then shall the brave. </em></p><p>Then the following verse is not to begin, as in our version, which has been followed by <em>Newcome </em>and <em>Henderson</em>, “That day <em>is </em>a day of wrath,” but thus— </p><p><em>A day of wrath </em>shall be<em>that day. </em></p><p>This is the order of the original, and as there is no verb, it must be supplied and regulated as to its tense by the context.—<em>Ed. </em></p></div>
