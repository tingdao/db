<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Who through the eternal Spirit, etc. </em>He now clearly shows how Christ’s death is to be estimated, not by the external act, but by the power of the Spirit. For Christ suffered as man; but that death becomes saving to us through the efficacious power of the Spirit; for a sacrifice, which was to be an eternal expiation, was a work more than human. And he calls the Spirit <em>eternal </em>for this reason, that we may know that the reconciliation, of which he is the worker or effecter, is eternal. <span class="cite-ref">(150)</span> By saying, <em>without spot, </em>or unblamable, though he alludes to the victims under the Law, which were not to have a blemish or defect, he yet means, that Christ alone was the lawful victim and capable of appeasing God; for there was always in others something that might be justly deemed wanting; and hence he said before that the covenant of the Law was not<span class="lang el-gr">ἀμεμπτον, </span> blameless. </p><p><em>From dead works, etc. </em>Understand by these either such works as produce death, or such as are the fruits or effects of death; for as the life of the soul is our union with God, so they who are alienated from him through sin may be justly deemed to be dead. </p><p><em>To serve the living God. </em>This, we must observe, is the end of our purgation; for we are not washed by Christ, that we may plunge ourselves again into new filth, but that our purity may serve to glorify God. Besides, he teaches us, that nothing can proceed from us that can be pleasing to God until we are purified by the blood of Christ; for as we are all enemies to God before our reconciliation, so he regards as abominable all our works; hence the beginning of acceptable service is reconciliation. And then, as no work is so pure and so free from stains, that it can of itself please God, it is necessary that the purgation through the blood of Christ should intervene, which alone can efface all stains. And there is a striking contrast between the living God and dead works. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(150)</span> Some as Grotius and Schleusner, take “the eternal Spirit” as meaning the same thing as “endless life” in <span class="bvs">Heb_7:16</span>, — “who having (or in) an eternal spirit,” or life, etc.; they give the sense of “in” to<span class="lang el-gr">διὰ. </span> The comparison they represent to be between perishable victims and the sacrifice of Christ, who possesses a spirit or life that is eternal. </p><p>Others, as Junius and Beza, consider Christ’s divine nature as signified by “the eternal Spirit.” Beza says, that it was the Deity united to humanity that consecrated the whole sacrifice and endued it with vivifying power. The view of Stuart can hardly be comprehended. </p><p>But the explanation most commonly adopted is that given here by Calvin that the Holy Spirit is meant, whose aid and influence are often mentioned in connection with Christ; see <span class="bvs">Mat_12:28</span>; <span class="bvs">Act_1:2</span>. Some MSS and fathers have “holy” instead of “eternal,” but the greatest number and the best have the last word. Dr. Owen, Doddridge and Scott take this view. Why the Spirit is called “eternal” is not very evident. It may have been for the purpose of showing that the Spirit mentioned before in <span class="bvs">Heb_9:8</span> is the same Spirit, he being eternal, and thus in order to prove that the offering of Christ was according to the divine will. God is said to be eternal in <span class="bvs">Rom_16:26</span>, where a reference is made to the past and the present dispensation, with the view, as it seems, to show that he is the author of both. But perhaps the explanation of Calvin is the most suitable. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
