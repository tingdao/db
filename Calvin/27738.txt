Again, this pride is coupled with tyranny, so that their subjects, and those who are under them, may do nothing, but as for themselves, they may do whatsoever they will. So fareth it at this day in Popery, the more liberty that impure clergy doth grant to itself, and the more carelessly it waxeth wanton, and polluteth the whole world with the sins which flow thence, the more straitly do they rule and stay the tongues of the people. Therefore, if any man dare be so bold as once to whisper, a little liberty doth cause them to make outrageous outcries as it were heinous sacrilege.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(526)</span></p><p>“ Eadem omnes intemperie laborasse,” that they all laboured under the same intemperance, </p><p><span class="cite-note">(527)</span></p><p>“ In commune illorum dedecus,” to their common disgrace. </p></div></div>
