<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Thou shalt not bow down to their gods. </em>Moses repeats what had been before said, that the worship of God must <em>be </em>separated from all the superstitions of the Gentiles; for this error has been everywhere rife, that unbelievers would rather draw down God to themselves on earth, than ascend above to seek for Him. And in this sense we have said that idols are called gods; because it is impossible but that he who would represent God by wood and stone, should associate Him with corruptible matter. Experience also teaches us, that all the wicked are so attached to their idols, that they gain nothing by their subterfuge, when they allege that this is a necessary help to their ignorance. The following clause, “nor do after their works,” sufficiently proves that all corrupt worship is comprehended under the term idolatry. </p></div>
