<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet interrogates the angel concerning the Fourth Beast more attentively and carefully; as we formerly saw him touched with greater admiration on beholding the beast which was formidable beyond the other three, so that neither a name nor representation could be found for it. As, therefore, God displayed something great under the image of the fourth beast, he caused his Prophet to wake up to understand the mystery of it. For this reason he now interrogates the angel; for he says <em>he wished for the truth </em>concerning the fourth beast, and he also repeats what we saw before, namely, <em>its being different from the others </em>And surely the subjugation of so many kings by the Romans was a difference worthy of notice. Let us think upon the origin of that nation; — a few robbers seizing upon a desert spot, growing great by brutal audacity and force, until they reduced all their neighbors under their power. Then they crossed the sea, and added first one province, and then another to their sway. And when the kingdom of Macedon came within their power, this was indeed portentous. At length they became masters throughout the whole circuit of the Mediterranean, and there was no corner which did not receive their yoke; and this could never have been imagined by human apprehension. </p><p>It is said then, <em>this beast was different from the others, and very terrible. </em>In the same sense <em>its teeth </em>are called <em>iron, </em>and <em>its claws brazen</em>. No mention had hitherto been made of his claw; the Prophet had spoken only of iron teeth, but he now adds <em>brazen claws, </em>as if he had said, This beast shall be endued with such savage madness, as not only to attack all things by its unusual violence, but to tear, lacerate, and devour all things; as he repeats again what he had said, <em>eating and destroying and treading under foot the remainder </em>As. I have already explained all these points, I am unwilling to consume your time in vain and to confuse you with useless repetitions. I <em>asked also</em>, said he<em>, concerning the ten horns, which, were upon its head </em>And this is the reason why I must cut the subject off shortly here, as the angel’s reply will follow directly. The Prophet, therefore, is now, without doubt, placed under a celestial impulse, because God was unwilling to teach him only as a private person; he was. to be a witness and herald of so great a mystery; and we may at this day learn from his writings, which are of the utmost use to us when we become fully acquainted with them. </p></div>
