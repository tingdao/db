<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>46.</strong><em>Never man spoke like this man. </em>Those officers acknowledge that they are subdued and vanquished by the word of Christ, and yet they do not on that account repent or give due honor to the word. If it be true, that <em>never man spoke like this man</em>, why did not the Divine power, which they were compelled to feel, touch their hearts in such a manner as to cause them to devote themselves wholly to God? But it was necessary that the prediction of Isaiah should thus be accomplished: </p><p>he will prostrate the wicked by the breath of his mouth, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Isa_11:4</span>.) </p><p>Nay more, we shall afterwards see how those who were attempting to put him to death, overwhelmed by the voice of Christ alone, and as if they had been struck down with mallets, fell backwards, (<span class="bvs">Joh_18:6</span>.) Let us, therefore, learn that the doctrine of Christ possesses such power as even to terrify the wicked; but as this tends to their destruction, let us take care that we be softened, instead of being broken. Even in the present day, we see many persons who too much resemble those officers, who are reluctantly drawn into admiration of the doctrine of the Gospel, and yet are so far from yielding to Christ, that they still remain in the enemy’s camp. There are others even worse, who, for the sake of obtaining favor with the wicked, employ all the opprobrious terms which they can find for basely slandering that doctrine, which, notwithstanding, they acknowledge to be from God, because they are convinced of it in their hearts. <span class="cite-ref">(203)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(203)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Laquelle toutesfois ils confessent estre de Dieu, d’autant qu’ils en sont conveincus en leurs coeurs</span>.” </p></div></div>
