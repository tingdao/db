<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>As it is written. </em>The passage, that Paul quotes, refers to the manna, but let us hear what the Lord says by Moses. He would have this to serve as a never-failing proof, that men do not live by bread alone, but are Divinely supported, by the secret influence of <em>His </em>will, who maintains and preserves all things that he has created. Again, in another passage, (<span class="bvs">Deu_8:3</span>,) Moses admonishes them, that they had been nourished for a time with such food, that they might learn that men are supported — not by their own industry or labor, but by the blessing of God. Hence it appears, that in the manna, as in a mirror, there is presented to us an emblem of the ordinary food that we partake of. Let us now come to the passage that Paul quotes. When the manna had fallen, they were commanded to gather it in heaps, so far as every one could, though at the same time, as some are more active than others, there was more gathered by some than was necessary for daily use, <span class="cite-ref">(681)</span> yet no one took for his own private use more than an homer, <span class="cite-ref">(682)</span> for that was the measure that was prescribed by the Lord. This being the case, all had as much as was sufficient, and no one was in want. This we have in <span class="bvs">Exo_16:18</span></p><p>Let us now apply the history to Paul’s object. The Lord has not prescribed to us an homer, or any other measure, according to which the food of each day is to be regulated, but he has enjoined upon us frugality and temperance, and has forbidden, that any one should go to excess, taking advantage of his abundance. Let those, then, that have riches, whether they have been left by inheritance, or procured by industry and efforts, consider that their abundance was not intended to be laid out in intemperance or excess, but in relieving the necessities of the brethren. For whatever we have is <em>manna, </em>from whatever quarter it comes, provided it be really <em>ours, </em>inasmuch as riches acquired by fraud, and unlawful artifices, are unworthy to be called so, but are rather <em>quails </em>sent forth by the anger of God. (<span class="bvs">Num_11:31</span>.) And as in the case of one hoarding the manna, either from excessive greed or from distrust, what was laid up immediately putrified, so we need not doubt that the riches, that are heaped up at the expense of our brethren, are accursed, and will soon perish, and that too, in connection with the ruin of the owner; so that we are not to think that it is the way to increase, if, consulting our own advantage for a long while to come, we defraud our poor brethren of the beneficence that we owe them. <span class="cite-ref">(683)</span> I acknowledge, indeed, that there is not enjoined upon us an equality of such a kind, as to make it unlawful for the rich to live in any degree of greater elegance than the poor; but an equality is to be observed thus far — that no one is to be allowed to starve, and no one is to hoard his abundance at the expense of defrauding others. The poor man’s <em>homer </em><span class="cite-ref">(684)</span> will be coarse food and a spare diet; the rich man’s <em>homer </em>will be a more abundant portion, it is true, according to his circumstances, but at the same time in such a way that they live temperately, and are not wanting to others. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(681)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien qu’aucuns en amassassent plus qu’il ne leur estoit de besoin pour la nourriture d’vn iour, et les autres moins (comme les vns sont plus habiles que les autres</span>;)” — “Though some gathered more of it than was needed by them as the food of a day, and others less (as some are more expert than others).” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(682)</span> “An omer was about three quarts English measure. It is inferred by some that, when any one had gathered more than his due share, he gave the overplus to those who had gathered less. Others, however, suppose that the whole quantity gathered by any one family was first put into a common mass, and then measured out to the several individuals composing the <em>household. </em>” — <em>Bush’s Notes on Exodus. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(683)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le secours et assistance</span>;” — “The help and assistance.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(684)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">L’homer, c’est a dire la mesure des poures</span>;” — “The homer, that is to say, the measure of the poor.” </p></div></div>
