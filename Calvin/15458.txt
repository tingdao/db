<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>For Jehovah is a great God</em>. By these words the Psalmist reminds us what abundant grounds we have for praising God, and how far we are from needing to employ the lying panegyric with which rhetoricians flatter earthly princes. First, he extols the greatness of God, drawing a tacit contrast between him and such false gods as men have invented for themselves. We know that there has always been a host of gods in the world, as Paul says, </p><p>“There are many on the earth who are called gods,”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_8:5</span>.) </p><p>We are to notice the opposition stated between the God of Israel and all others which man has formed in the exercise of an unlicensed imagination. Should any object, that “an idol is nothing in the world,” (<span class="bvs">1Co_8:4</span>,) it is enough to reply, that the Psalmist aims at denouncing the vain delusions of men who have framed gods after their own foolish device. I admit, however, that under this term he may have comprehended the angels, asserting God to be possessed of such excellence as exalted him far above all heavenly glory, and whatever might be considered Divine, as well as above the feigned deities of earth. <span class="cite-ref">(45)</span> Angels are not indeed gods, but the name admits of an improper application to them on account of their being next to God, and still more, on account of their being accounted no less than gods by men who inordinately and superstitiously extol them. If the heavenly angels themselves must yield before the majesty of the one God, it were the height of indignity to compare him with gods who are the mere fictions of the brain. In proof of his greatness, he bids us look to his formation of the world, which he declares to be <em>the work of God’s hands, </em>and subject to his power. This is one general ground why God is to be praised, that he has clearly shown forth his glory in the creation of the world, and will have us daily recognize him in the government of it. When it is said, that <em>the depths of the earth are in his hand, </em>the meaning is, that it is ruled by his providence, and subject to his power. Some read, <em>the bounds of the earth, </em>but the word means <em>abysses </em>or <em>depths</em>, as opposed to <em>the heights of the mountains. </em>The Hebrew word properly signifies <em>searching. </em></p><p><strong>(45)</strong> “Deum ita excellere, ut longe emineat supra omnem coelestem gloriam et quicquid divinum est, non minus quam supra omne terrenum figmentum.” — <em>Lat</em>. </p></div>
