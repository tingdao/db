<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>They shall speak forth</em>, <em>etc</em>. As the verb <span class="lang he-il">נבע</span>, <em>nabang</em>, means properly to <em>gush out</em>, some suppose, that, as applied to speech, it means not simply speaking, but an overflowing utterance, like water rushing from a fountain, and the verb <span class="lang he-il">ירננו</span>, <em>yerannenu</em>, in the close of the verse, answers to this, meaning <em>to shout</em>, or <em>sing aloud</em>. To celebrate the memory of the Lord’s goodness, is the same with recalling to memory what we have personally experienced of his goodness. We cannot deny God’s claim to praise in all his excellencies, but we are most sensibly affected by such proofs of his fatherly mercy as we have ourselves experienced. David makes use, therefore, of this alluring consideration to induce us the more readily and cheerfully to engage in the praises of God, or rather, (according to the figurative word already used,) to burst forth in celebration of them. </p></div>
