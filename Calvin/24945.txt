<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>51.</strong><em>He hath done might </em>This means, “he hath wrought powerfully.” The <em>arm </em>of God is contrasted with every other aid: as in Isaiah, “I looked, and there was none to help,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_63:5</span>;) <em>“therefore,” </em>says he elsewhere, </p><p>“his arm brought salvation unto him; <LineBreak />and his righteousness, it sustained him,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_59:16</span>.) </p><p>Mary therefore means: God rested satisfied with his own power, employed no companions in the work, called none to afford him aid. What immediately follows about <em>the proud </em>may be supposed to be added for one of two reasons: either because <em>the proud </em>gain nothing by endeavoring, like the giants of old, to oppose God; or, because God does not display the power of his arm for salvation, except in the case of the <em>humble, </em>while <em>the proud, </em>who arrogate much to themselves, are <em>thrown down </em>To this relates the exhortation of Peter, </p><p>“Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Pe_5:6</span>.) </p><p><em>He hath scattered </em><span class="cite-ref">(56)</span><em>the proud in the thought of their heart </em><span class="cite-ref">(57)</span> This expression is worthy of notice: for as their pride and ambition are outrageous, as their covetousness is insatiable, they pile up their deliberations to form an immense heap, and, to say all in a single word, they build the tower of Babel, (<span class="bvs">Gen_11:9</span>.) Not satisfied with having made one or another foolish attempt beyond their strength, or with their former schemes of mad presumption, they still add to their amount. When God has for a time looked down from heaven, in silent mockery, on their splendid preparations, he unexpectedly scatters the whole mass: just as when a building is overturned, and its parts, which had formerly been bound together by a strong and firm union, are widely scattered in every direction. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(56)</span><span class="lang el-gr">διεσχόρπισεν,, </span> he <em>utterly discomfits, </em>a metaphor derived from putting to flight a defeated enemy.
