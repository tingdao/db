<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>At midnight a cry arose. </em>With respect to the <em>cry </em>I view it as taken metaphorically for his sudden arrival; for we know, that when any thing new and unexpected happens, men are wont to make a loud noise. True, indeed, our Lord <em>cries </em>daily, that <em>he will come quickly, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rev_22:20</span>;) but at that, time, the whole frame of the world will resound with the <em>cry, </em>and his dreadful majesty will fill heaven and earth in such a manner, as not only to awaken those who are <em>asleep, </em>but to bring the dead <em>out of their graves, </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_5:28</span>.) </p></div>
