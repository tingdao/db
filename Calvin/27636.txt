<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>He lay down upon him. </em>We know that the apostles, in working miracles, did sometimes use certain external rites, whereby they might give the glory to God, the author. And now, whereas Paul doth stretch himself upon the young man, I think it was done to no other end, save only that he might more easily stir up himself unto prayer. It is all one as if he should mix himself with the dead man,<span class="cite-ref">(405)</span> And, peradventure, this was done for the imitation of Elisha, of whom the sacred history doth report the same thing ( <span class="bvs">2Kg_4:34</span>). Yet the vehemency of his affection did more move him than the emulation of the prophet. For that stretching of himself upon him doth more provoke him to crave his life with all his heart at the hands of the Lord. So when he embraceth the body of the dead man, by this gesture he declared that he offered it to God to be quickened, and out of the text we may gather that he did not depart from embracing it until he knew that the life was restored again.</p><p><em>Be ye not troubled. </em>We must note that Paul took great care principally for this cause, lest that sorrowful event should shake the faith of the godly, and should trouble their minds. Nevertheless, the Lord did, as it were, seal up and establish<span class="cite-ref">(406)</span> that last sermon which Paul made at Troas. When he saith that his soul is in him, he doth not deny that he was dead, because by this means he should extinguish the glory of the miracle; but the meaning of these words is, that his life was restored through the grace of God. I do not restrain that which followeth, to wit, that they were greatly comforted through the joy which they had by reason of the young man which was restored to life; but I do also comprehend the confirmation of faith, seeing God gave them such an excellent testimony of his love.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(405)</span></p><p>“ Perinde agit, acsi se misceret cum mortuo,” he acts just as if he were mixing himself up with the young man. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(406)</span></p><p>“ Quasi insculpto sigillo apud eos sancivit,” did sanction to them as with the impress of the seal. </p></div></div>
