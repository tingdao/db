<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_7:7</span><strong>.</strong><em>Ask, and it shall be given you </em>It is an exhortation to prayer: and as in this exercise of religion, which ought to be our first concern, we are so careless and sluggish, Christ presses the same thing upon us under three forms of expression. There is no superfluity of language, when he says, <em>Ask, seek, knock: </em>but lest the simple doctrine should be unimpressive, he perseveres in order to rouse us from our inactivity. Such is also the design of the promises that are added, Ye <em>shall find, it shall be given to you, and it shall be opened </em>Nothing is better adapted to excite us to prayer than a full conviction that we shall be heard. Those who doubt can only pray in an indifferent manner; and prayer, unaccompanied by faith, is an idle and unmeaning ceremony. Accordingly, Christ, in order to excite us powerfully to this part of our duty, not only enjoins what we ought to do, but promises that our prayers shall not be fruitless. </p><p>This ought to be carefully observed. First, we learn from it, that this rule of prayer is laid down and prescribed to us, that we may be fully convinced, that God will be gracious to us, and will listen to our requests. Again, whenever we engage in prayer, or whenever we feel that our ardor in prayer is not sufficiently strong, we ought to remember the gentle invitation, by which Christ assures us of God’s fatherly kindness. Each of us, trusting to the grace of Christ, will thus attain confidence in prayer, and will venture freely to call upon God </p><p>“through Jesus Christ our Lord, in whom (as Paul says) <LineBreak />we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Eph_3:11</span>.) </p><p>But, as we are too prone to distrust, Christ, in order to correct this fault also, repeats the promise in a variety of words. He uses the metaphor <em>seek, </em>because we think, that those things which our wants and necessities require are far distant from us — and <em>knock, </em>because our carnal senses imagine, that those things which are not immediately at hand are shut up. </p></div>
