He mentions first, <em>what is just</em>, by which term he expresses that kindness, as to which he has given injunction in the Epistle to the Ephesians. (<span class="bvs">Eph_6:8</span>.) But as masters, looking down as it were from aloft, despise the condition of servants, so that they think that they are bound by no law, Paul brings them under control, <span class="cite-ref">(462)</span> because both are equally under subjection to the authority of God. Hence that <em>equity </em>of which he makes mention. </p><p><em>And mutual equity. </em>Some understand it otherwise, but I have no doubt that Paul here employed <span class="lang el-gr">ἰσότητα</span> to mean analogical <span class="cite-ref">(463)</span> or distributive right, <span class="cite-ref">(464)</span> as in <em>Ephesians</em>, <span class="lang el-gr">τὰ αὐτὰ</span>, (<em>the same things</em>.) <span class="cite-ref">(465)</span> For masters have not their servants bound to them in such a manner as not to owe something to them in their turn, as analogical right to be in force among all ranks. <span class="cite-ref">(466)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(462)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et rabbaisse leur presomption</span>;” — “And beats down their presumption.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(463)</span> Our author, has here in view a definition of Aristotle, quoted by him when commenting on <span class="bvs">2Co_8:13</span>.
