<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_3:9</span><strong>.</strong><em>And think not to say within yourselves. </em><span class="bvs">Luk_3:8</span><strong>.</strong><em>And begin not to say within yourselves. </em>As the import of both phrases is undoubtedly the same, it is easy to ascertain what John meant. Till hypocrites are hard pressed, they either sleep in their sins, or indulge in licentious mirth. <span class="cite-ref">(268)</span> But when they are summoned to the tribunal of God, they eagerly seek for some subterfuge or concealment, or some covering to interpose between God and them. John’s address to the Pharisees and Sadducees amounts to this: <em>“ </em>Now that I have sharply upbraided you, do not, as persons of your stamp are wont to do endeavor to find a remedy in an empty and deceitful title.” </p><p>He thus tears from them the wicked confidence, by which they had been bewitched. The covenant, which God had made with Abraham, was employed by them as a shield to defend a bad conscience: not that they rested their salvation on the person of one man, but that God had adopted all the posterity of Abraham. Meanwhile, they did not consider, that none are entitled to be regarded as belonging to “the seed of Abraham,” (<span class="bvs">Joh_8:33</span>,) but those who follow his faith, and that without faith the covenant of God has no influence whatever in procuring salvation. And even the little word, <em>in yourselves, </em>is not without meaning: for though they did not boast in words, that they were Abraham’s children, yet they were inwardly delighted with this title, as hypocrites are not ashamed to practice grosser impositions on God than on men. </p><p><em>God is able. </em>The Jews flattered themselves with nearly the same pretenses, as are now brought forward insolently by the Papists. “There must be some Church in the world; because it is the will of God that he be acknowledged, and his name invoked, in the world. But the Church can be nowhere else than among us, to whom God has entrusted his covenant.” <span class="cite-ref">(269)</span> This arrogance was chiefly displayed by the high priests, and by others who had any share of government or authority. The common people were treated by them as profane and <em>“ </em>accursed,<em>” </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_7:49</span>,) and they looked upon themselves as the holy first-fruits; just as, in our own day, mitred Bishops, Abbots, Canons, Monks, Sorbonnists, and every description of Priests, glorying in the proud title of Clergy, regard the Laity with contempt. This error, of relying too much on the promise of God, John exposes and refutes, by saying that, though God passes by them, he will not want a Church. </p><p>The meaning of the words, therefore, is: “God has made an everlasting covenant with Abraham and his seed. In one point you are mistaken. While you are worse than bastards, <span class="cite-ref">(270)</span> you imagine that you are the only children of Abraham. But God will raise up elsewhere a new seed of Abraham, which does not now appear.” He says in the dative case, <em>children To ABRAHAM</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">τῶ ᾿Αβραὰμ</span>,) to inform us, that the promise of God will not fail, and that Abraham, who relied on it, was not deceived, though his seed be not found in you. Thus from the beginning of the world the Lord has been faithful to his servants, and has never failed to fulfill the promise which he made to them, that he would extend mercy to their children, though he rejected hypocrites. Some imagine, that John spoke of the calling of the Gentiles. This appears to me to be without foundation: but as proud men did not believe it to be possible that the Church should be removed to another place, he reminds them, that God has in his power ways of preserving his Church, which they did not think of, any more than they believed that he could create <em>children </em>out of <em>stones. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(268)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils s'endorment toujours en leurs vices, ou s'egayent comme chevaux eschappez</span>.” — “They sleep always in their sins, or indulge in merriment, like horses let loose.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(269)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D'autant que le Seigneur nous a ordonnez gardiens de son alliance</span>.” — “Because the Lord has appointed us guardians of his covenant.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(270)</span> “Quum sitis plus quam degeneres.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien qu' a la verite vous soyez pires que bastards</span>.” </p></div></div>
