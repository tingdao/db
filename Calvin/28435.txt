<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>But it is required in ministers </em><span class="cite-ref">(211)</span> It is as though he had said, it is not enough to be a <em>steward </em>if there be not an upright stewardship. Now the rule of an upright stewardship, is to conduct one’s self in it with fidelity. It is a passage that ought to be carefully observed, for we see how haughtily <span class="cite-ref">(212)</span> Papists require that everything that they do and teach should have the authority of law, simply on the ground of their being called pastors. On the other hand, Paul is so far from being satisfied with the mere title, that, in his view, it is not even enough that there is a legitimate call, unless the person who is called conducts himself in the office with fidelity. On every occasion, therefore, on which Papists hold up before us the mask of a name, for the purpose of maintaining the tyranny of their idol, let our answer be, that Paul requires more than this from the <em>ministers of Christ</em>, though, at the same time, the Pope and his attendant train are wanting not merely in fidelity in the discharge of the office, but also in the ministry itself, if everything is duly considered. </p><p>This passage, however, militates, not merely against wicked teachers, but also against all that have any other object in view than the glory of Christ and the edification of the Church. For every one that teaches the truth is not necessarily faithful, but, only he who desires from the heart to serve the Lord and advance Christ’s kingdom. Nor is it without good reason that Augustine assigns to <em>hirelings</em>, (<span class="bvs">Joh_10:12</span>,) a middle place between the <em>wolves </em>and the good teachers. As to Christ’s requiring <em>wisdom </em>also on the part of the good <em>steward</em>, (<span class="bvs">Luk_12:42</span>,) he speaks, it is true, in that passage with greater clearness than Paul, but the meaning is the same. For the <em>faithfulness </em>of which Christ speaks is uprightness of conscience, which must be accompanied with sound and prudent counsel. By a faithful minister Paul means one who, with knowledge as well as uprightness, <span class="cite-ref">(213)</span> discharges the office of a good and faithful minister. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(211)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Entre les dispensateurs</span>;” — “Among stewards.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(212)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et d’une facon magistrale</span>;” — “And with a magisterial air.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(213)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Auec science et bonne discretion, et d’vn coeur droit</span>;” — “With knowledge and good discretion, as well as with an upright heart.” </p></div></div>
