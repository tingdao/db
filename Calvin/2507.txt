<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And he said, Behold, I make a covenant </em>It is not specified with whom God would make the covenant. Some interpreters, <span class="cite-ref">(386)</span> therefore, supply the name of Moses, and this they seem to do on probable grounds, especially since it is added at the end of the verse “the work <span class="cite-ref">(387)</span> that I will do with thee.” But, inasmuch as Moses stipulated in the name of all, the meaning comes to the same thing, if we read, I will make a covenant openly with the whole people. By this promise, then, God, as it were, entirely restored the Israelites, for He declares that He will deal so marvellously in the discomfiture of the nations, as to prove that He is the peculiar God of that people; and this was to distinguish them from other nations, according to the prayer of Moses. he says that they shall all be eye-witnesses of this, that, being thus at length convinced by their own senses, they might sincerely and faithfully submit themselves to his dominion. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(386)</span> Thus the <em>LXX.; </em><span class="lang el-gr">Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσὢν, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ τίθημί σοι διαθήκην</span></p><p><span class="cite-note">(387)</span> “The thing.” — <em>A.V. </em></p></div></div>
