<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18</strong><em>Forasmuch as ye know, </em>or, <em>knowing</em>. Here is another reason, drawn from the price of our redemption, which ought always to be remembered when our salvation is spoken of. For to him who repudiates or despises the grace of the gospel, not only his own salvation is worthless, but also the blood of Christ, by which God has manifested its value. But we know how dreadfully sacrilegious it is to regard as common the blood of the Son of God. There is hence nothing which ought so much to stimulate us to the practice of holiness, as the memory of this price of our redemption. </p><p><em>Silver and gold </em>For the sake of amplifying he mentions these things in contrast, so that we may know that the whole world, and all things deemed precious by men, are nothing to the excellency and value of this price. </p><p>But he says that they had been <em>redeemed from </em>their <em>vain conversation, </em><span class="cite-ref">(16)</span> in order that we might know that the whole life of man, until he is converted to Christ, is a ruinous labyrinth of wanderings. He also intimates, that it is not through our merits that we are restored to the right way, but because it is God’s will that the price, offered for our salvation, should be effectual in our behalf. Then the blood of Christ is not only the pledge of our salvation, but also the cause of our calling. </p><p>Moreover, Peter warns us to beware lest our unbelief should render this price void or of no effect. As Paul boasts that he worshipped God with a pure conscience from his forefathers, (<span class="bvs">2Ti_1:3</span>,) and as he also commends to Timothy for his imitation the piety of his grandmother Lois, and of his mother Eunice, (<span class="bvs">2Ti_1:5</span>,) and as Christ also said of the Jews that they knew whom they worshipped (<span class="bvs">Joh_4:22</span>,) it may seem strange that Peter should assert that the Jews of his time learnt nothing from their fathers but mere vanity. To this I answer, that Christ, when he declared that the way or the knowledge of true religion belonged to the Jews, referred to the law and the commandments of God rather than to the people; for the temple had not to no purpose been built at Jerusalem, nor was God worshipped there according to the fancies of men, but according to what was prescribed in the Law; he, therefore, said that the Jews were not going astray while observing the Law. As to Paul’s forefathers, and as to Lois, Eunice, and similar cases, there is no doubt but that God ever had at least a small remnant among that people, in whom sincere piety continued, while the body of the people had become wholly corrupt, and had plunged themselves into all kinds of errors. Innumerable superstitions were followed, hypocrisy prevailed, the hope of salvation was built on the merest trifles; they were not only imbued with false opinions, but also fascinated with the grossest dotages; and they who had been scattered to various parts of the world, were implicated in still greater corruptions. In short, the greater part of that nation had either wholly fallen away from true religion, or had much degenerated. When, therefore, Peter condemned the doctrine of the fathers, he viewed it as unconnected with Christ, who is the soul and the truth of the Law. </p><p>But we hence learn, that as soon as men depart from Christ, they go fatally astray. In vain is pretended in this case the authority of the Fathers or an ancient custom. For the Prophet Ezekiel cried to the Jews, </p><p>“Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Eze_20:18</span>.) </p><p>This ought also to be no less attended to by us in the present day; for, in order that the redemption of Christ may be effectual and useful to us, we must renounce our former life, though derived from the teaching and practice of our fathers. Thrice foolish, then, are the Papists, who think that the name of Fathers is a sufficient defense for all their superstitions, so that they boldly reject whatever is brought forward from the Word of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(16)</span> ‘The verb <span class="lang el-gr">λυτρόω</span> means properly to redeem by a price from tyranny or bondage, but its meaning here, and in <span class="bvs">Luk_24:21</span>, and <span class="cite-note">Titus 2:14</span>, is merely to deliver. “Vain conversation” signifies a useless, profitless mode of living. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
