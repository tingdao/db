We must attend to the reason why it is said that <em>the sheep follow</em>; it is, because <em>they know </em>how to distinguish <em>shepherds </em>from wolves by <em>the voice </em>This is the spirit of discernment, by which the elect discriminate between the truth of God and the false inventions of men. So then, in <em>the sheep </em>of Christ a knowledge of the truth goes before, and next follows an earnest desire to obey, so that they not only understand what is true, but receive it with warm affection. And not only does he commend the obedience of the faith, because the sheep assemble submissively at <em>the voice </em>of the shepherd, but also because they do not listen to the voice of <em>strangers, </em>and do not disperse when any one cries to them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(283)</span> The word <em>pastor </em>signifies <em>shepherd</em>, but, for the sake of the reader, who may not be aware of its etymology, it has been found necessary, in some cases, to employ both of the words, especially where the figure holds so prominent a place in the discussion. â€” <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
