For having heard the praises of celibacy, and having heard also of the inconveniences of matrimony, they might be in doubt, whether it were at all a kind thing to involve their children in so many miseries, lest it should seem as if <em>they </em>were to blame for the troubles that might befall them. For the greater their attachment to their children, so much the more anxiously do they exercise fear and caution on their account. <span class="cite-ref">(439)</span> Paul, then, with the view of relieving them from this difficulty, teaches that it is their duty to consult their advantage, exactly as one would do for himself when at his own disposal. <span class="cite-ref">(440)</span> Now he still keeps up the distinction, which he has made use of all along, so as to commend celibacy, but, at the same time, to leave marriage as a matter of choice; and not simply a matter of choice, but a needful remedy for incontinency, which ought not to be denied to any one. In <em>the first </em>part of the statement he speaks as to the giving of daughters in marriage, and he declares that those do not sin in giving away their daughters in marriage, who are of opinion that an unmarried life is not suitable for them. </p><p>The word <span class="lang el-gr">ἀσχημονεῖν</span> (to be <em>unseemly</em>) must be taken as referring to a special propriety, which depends on what is natural to the individual; for there is a <em>general </em>propriety, which philosophers make to be a part of temperance. <em>That </em>belongs equally to all. There is another, that is <em>special</em>, because one thing becomes one individual that would not be <em>seemly </em>in another. Every one therefore should consider (as Cicero observes) what is the part that nature has assigned to him. <span class="cite-ref">(441)</span> Celibacy will be <em>seemly </em>for one, but he must not measure all by his own foot; <span class="cite-ref">(442)</span> and others should not attempt to imitate him without taking into view their ability; for it is the imitation of the ape — which is at variance with nature. If, therefore, a father, having duly considered his daughter’s disposition, is of opinion that she is not prepared for celibacy, let him give her away in marriage. <span class="cite-ref">(443)</span></p><p>By<em>the flower of her age </em>he means the marriageable age. This lawyers define to be from twelve to twenty years of age. Paul points out, in passing, what equity and humanity ought to be exercised by parents, in applying a remedy in that tender and slippery age, when the force of the disease requires it. <em>And it requires to be so. </em>In this clause I understand him as referring to the girl’s infirmity — in the event of her not having the gift of continency; for in that case, necessity constrains her to marry. As to Jerome’s making a handle of the expression <em>sinneth not</em>, for reviling marriage, with a view to its disparagement, as if it were not a praiseworthy action to dispose of a daughter in marriage, it is quite childish. <span class="cite-ref">(444)</span> For Paul reckoned it enough to exempt fathers from blame, that they might not reckon it a cruel thing to subject their daughters to the vexations connected with marriage. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(439)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tant plus ils craignent qu’il ne leur adviene quelque inconvenient, et tant plus sont ils diligens a se donner garde pour eux</span>;” — “So much the more do they fear lest they should meet with any inconvenience, and so much the more careful are they to use precautions on their account.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(440)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand il n’est point sous la puissance d’autruy</span>;” — “When he is not under the power of another.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(441)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La condition et propriete que nature luy a donnee</span>;” — “The condition and propriety that nature has assigned to him.” See Cic. de Off. 1. 28. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(442)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme on dit</span>;” — “As they say.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(443)</span> Calvin seems to have understood the verb <span class="lang el-gr">ἀσχημονεῖν</span> here as meaning <em>to be unseemly </em>The ordinary meaning of the word is, <em>to act in an unseemly manner </em>It occurs in this sense in <span class="bvs">1Co_13:5</span>, and in various instances in the Classics, (see Eur. Hec. 407,) and the construction of the passage seems to require that it be understood as meaning, that the father thinks that he <em>acts improperly towards </em>his virgin daughter, or <em>incurs somewhat of disgrace with respect to her</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(444)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est vne cauillation puerile</span>;<em>” </em>— “It is a childish cavil.” </p></div></div>
