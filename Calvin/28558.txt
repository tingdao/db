<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>What then is my reward? </em>He infers from what goes before, that he has a ground of glorying; in this, that he labored gratuitously in behalf of the Corinthians, because it appears from this, that he applied himself willingly to the office of teaching, inasmuch as he vigorously set himself to obviate all the hindrances in the way of the gospel; and not satisfied with merely teaching, endeavored to further the doctrine of it by every method. This then is the sum. “I am under the necessity of preaching the gospel: if I do it not, wo is unto me, for I resist God’s calling. But it is not enough to preach, unless I do it willingly; for he who fulfils the commandment of God unwillingly, does not act, as becomes him, suitably to his office. But if I obey God willingly, it will in that case be allowable for me to glory. Hence it was necessary for me to make the gospel <em>without charge</em>, that I might glory on good ground.” </p><p>Papists endeavor from this passage to establish their contrivance as to works of <em>supererogation</em>. <span class="cite-ref">(497)</span> “Paul,” they say, “would have fulfilled the duties of his office by preaching the gospel, but he adds something farther over and above. Hence he does something beyond what he is bound to do, for he distinguishes between what is done willingly and what is done from necessity.” I answer, that Paul, it is true, went a greater length than the ordinary calling of pastors required, because he refrained from taking pay, which the Lord allows pastors to take. But as it was a part of his duty to provide against every occasion of offense that he foresaw, and as he saw, that the course of the gospel would be impeded, if he made use of his liberty, though that was out of the ordinary course, yet I maintain that even in that case he rendered to God nothing more than was due. For I ask: “Is it not the part of a good pastor to remove occasions of offense, so far as it is in his power to do so?” I ask again, “Did Paul do anything else than this?” There is no ground, therefore, for imagining that he rendered to God anything that he did not owe to him, inasmuch as he did nothing but what the necessity of his office (though it was an extraordinary necessity) demanded. Away, then, with that wicked imagination, <span class="cite-ref">(498)</span> that we compensate for our faults in the sight of God by works of <em>supererogation</em>. <span class="cite-ref">(499)</span> Nay more, away with the very term, which is replete with diabolical pride. <span class="cite-ref">(500)</span> This passage, assuredly, is mistakenly perverted to bear that meaning. </p><p>The error of Papists is refuted in a general way in this manner: Whatever works are comprehended under the law, are falsely termed works of <em>supererogation</em>, as is manifest from the words of Christ. (<span class="bvs">Luk_17:10</span>.) </p><p>When ye have done all things that are commanded you, say, <LineBreak />We are unprofitable servants: we have done what we were bound to do. </p><p>Now we acknowledge that no work is good and acceptable to God, that is not included in God’s law. This <em>second </em>statement I prove in this way: There are two classes of good works; for they are all reducible either to the service of God or to love. Now nothing belongs to <em>the service of God </em>that is not included in this summary: <em>Thou shalt love the Lord with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy strength </em>There is also no duty of <em>love </em>that is not required in that precept — <em>Love thy neighbor as thyself </em>(<span class="bvs">Mar_12:30</span>.) But as to the objection that is brought forward by Papists, that it is possible for one to be acceptable, if he devotes the <em>tenth </em>part of his income, and infer from this, that if he goes so far as to devote the <em>fifth </em>part, he does a work of <em>supererogation</em>, it is easy to remove away this subtilty. For that the deeds of the pious are approved, is not by any means owing to their perfection, but it is because the imperfection and deficiency are not reckoned to their account. Hence even if they were doing an hundred-fold more than they do, they would not, even in that case, exceed the limits of the duty that they owe. </p><p><em>That I may not abuse my power. </em>From this it appears, that such a use of our liberty as gives occasion of offense, is an uncontrolled liberty and abuse. We must keep, therefore, within bounds, that we may not give occasion of offense. This passage also confirms more fully what I just now touched upon, that Paul did nothing beyond what the duty of his office required, because it was not proper that the liberty, that was allowed him by God, should be in any way abused. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(497)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, d’abondant</span>;” — “That is to say, over and above.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(498)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceste perverse et mal-heureuse imagination</span>;” — “That perverse and miserable fancy.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(499)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, lesquelles nous faisons de superabondant</span>;” — “That is to say, what we do over and above.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(500)</span> Our Author expresses himself in similar terms elsewhere as to the word <em>merit</em>.
