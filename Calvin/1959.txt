<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And the Lord spoke </em><span class="cite-ref">(174)</span><em>unto Moses </em>Moses here shows that he had done nothing without God’s command, but had faithfully and modestly discharged the office of a minister. And, surely, unless he had spoken according to God’s word, he would have been rash in promising what we have already seen. Therefore, this is put last in order, though it happened first; and, consequently, I have used <span class="cite-ref">(175)</span> the causal particle instead of the copula. The sum is, as before, that God will vindicate His own glory, which the people had impiously impugned, and that He would do good to them, unworthy as they were, in order to glorify His name; as if He had said, After you shall have been convicted of ingratitude, you will then be obliged to confess that I am really the only God, and at the same time your Father. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(174)</span> Had spoken. — <em>Lat</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(175)</span> J’ai mis le mot <em>Car</em>, pource que ceste sentence rend la raison du precedent. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
