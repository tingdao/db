<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>And when the day began. </em>Whatsoever the mariners think, Paul’s faith doth not quail;<span class="cite-ref">(648)</span> but he leaneth steadfastly to the promise which was made to him. For he doth not only exhort them to take meat, as did he who, in extreme despair, uttered these words, Dine, soldiers, we shall sup in hell;<span class="cite-ref">(649)</span> but continuing steadfast in his prophecy, he willeth them to be of good courage. The force of faith doth therein show itself, when as it armeth us unto patience, and doth valiantly bear off and beat back those assaults wherewith Satan goeth about to shake it. But whereas he saith, that they continued fasting for the space of fourteen days, it may seem absurd and false. There may some one man be found which can abide to fast long, but it is scarce credible of so great a multitude. We may easily answer, That their unwonted abstinence from meat is improperly called fasting; because they had never filled their belly during all that time; because those who are in sorrow and heaviness do almost loathe meat. And because despair was the cause of this their loathing of meat, he affirmeth again that they shall live, so they be of good courage. For a faithful minister of the word must not only bring abroad the promises, but also counsel men to follow God whithersoever he calleth them; and that they be not slothful and sluggish. Furthermore, the meaning of the words is this, God hath determined to save you, this confidence ought to animate you, and to make you merry,<span class="cite-ref">(650)</span> that you be not negligent in your own business.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(648)</span></p><p>“ Vacillat,” waver. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(649)</span></p><p>“ Apud inferos,” with the dead. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(650)</span></p><p>“ Alacres,” alert, active. </p></div></div>
