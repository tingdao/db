<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Wherefore I also. </em>This thanksgiving was not simply an expression of his ardent love to the Ephesians. He congratulated them before God, that the opinion which he had formed respecting them was highly favorable. Observe here, that under <em>faith and love </em>Paul includes generally the whole excellence of Christian character. He uses the expression, <em>faith in the Lord Jesus, </em><span class="cite-ref">(117)</span> because Christ is the aim and object of faith. <em>Love </em>ought to embrace all men, but here the <em>saints </em>are particularly mentioned; because love, when properly regulated, begins with them, and is afterwards extended to all others. If our love must have a view to God, the nearer any man approaches to God, the stronger unquestionably must be his claims to our love. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(117)</span> “‘Having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus.’ It is wrong to argue from this expression, with Olshausen and De Wette, that the apostle had no personal knowledge of the persons whom he addressed. This was an early surmise, for it is referred to by Theodoret. Some, says he, have supposed that the apostle wrote to the Ephesians, <span class="lang el-gr">ὡς μηδέπω θεασάμενος αὐτοὺς</span>, (as having never seen them.) But some years had elapsed since the apostle had visited Ephesus, and seen the Ephesian Church; and might he not refer to reports of their Christian steadfastness which had reached him? Nay, his use of the word may signify that such intelligence had been repeatedly brought to him.” — Eadie. </p></div></div>
