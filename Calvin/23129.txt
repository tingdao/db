<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Will a man defraud the gods? </em>Some give this version, “Will a man defraud God?” But it is strained and remote from the Prophet’s design; and they pervert the meaning. For I do not see what can be elicited from this rendering, “Will a man defraud God?” But there are other two meanings which may be taken. The first is, “Will a man defraud his gods?” The word <span class="lang he-il">אלהים</span>, <em>Aleim</em>, though it be in the plural number, is applied, as it is well known, to the true God; but it is applied also to idols; and in this place the Prophet seems to me to compare the Jews to the Gentiles, that their impiety might be made more evident. The same is the object of Jeremiah, when he says, </p><p>“Go, and survey the islands, is there a nation which has changed its gods, while yet they are no gods.” (<span class="bvs">Jer_2:10</span>.) </p><p>Since their blindness and obstinacy held fast the Gentiles in darkness, that they continued to worship the gods to whom they had been accustomed, it was an abominable wickedness in the Jews, that having been taught to worship the true God, they were yet continually influenced by ungodly levity, and sought new modes of worship, as though they wished to devise another god for themselves. So also in this place the Prophet seems to bring forward the Gentiles as an example to the Jews; for they discharged their duty towards their gods; but the Jews despised the supreme and the only true God: “Behold,” he says, “go round the world, and ye shall not find among the nations so unbridled a liberty as prevails among you; for they render obedience to their gods, and sacrilege is abominable to them; but ye defraud me. Am I inferior to idols? or is my state worse than theirs?” </p><p>Some take the word <span class="lang he-il">אלהים</span>, <em>Aleim</em>, for judges, as judges are sometimes so named; but this meaning seems not suitable on account of the word, Adam. As then this word generally means man, the Prophet, I have no doubt, intimates what I have stated, — that unbelievers, though sunk in darkness, are yet restrained by reverence and fear from changing their deity, and that they dare not to show levity when the name only of their god is pronounced. Since then such humility prevailed among unbelievers, could the impiety of that people, who had been trained up in the law, be excusable? a people too, upon whom God had ever made the doctrine of the law to shine. <span class="cite-ref">(253)</span></p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>Because ye have defrauded me; and ye have said, Thereby have we defrauded thee? In tenths and in oblations </em><span class="cite-ref">(254)</span> Here the Prophet again proves the people guilty of perverseness: it was indeed hypocrisy, and though gross, it was yet surpassed by impudence; for they asked, whereby they had defrauded God? and yet this was evident even to children: for we know, and we have seen elsewhere, that avarice so ruled among them, that every one, bent on their own profit, neglected the temple and the priests. Since then they were openly sacrilegious, how shameless they must have been to ask whereby they had defrauded God! The thing itself was indeed manifest and commonly known, so that children could see it. God however deemed it enough to convict them by one sentence, — that they defrauded him in the tenths and in the first-fruits; not that any advantage accrued to him from oblations, as he had no need of any such things; but he rightly calls and counts that his own which he had appointed for his own service. Since then he had instituted that order among the Jews, that they might by the tenths support the priests, and a part also was required for the poor, since God designed the firstfruits and other things to be offered to him, that men might thereby be continually reminded, that all things were his, and that whatever they received from his hand was sacred to him, he had previously called the bread laid on the table his own, and had called the sacrifices his own food, as though he did eat and drink. But as I have already said, we ought to regard the object in view, because his will was to be thus worshipped, and at the same time to keep as his own whatever belonged to his service. This then is the reason why he now complains of being defrauded of the tenths. </p><p>But we know that other sacrifices are now prescribed to us; and after prayer and praises, he bids us to relieve the poor and needy. God then, no doubt, is deprived by us of his right, when we are unkind to the poor, and refuse them aid in their necessity. We indeed thereby wrong men, and are cruel; but our crime is still more heinous, inasmuch as we are unfaithful stewards; for God deals more liberally with us than with others, for this end — that some portion of our abundance may come to the poor; and as he consecrates to their use what we abound in, we become guilty of sacrilege whenever we give not to our brethren what God commands us; for we know that he engages to repay, according to what is said in <span class="bvs">Pro_19:17</span>, “He who gives to the poor lends to God.” </p><p><strong>(253)</strong> Most differ from <em>Calvin </em>as to the word <span class="lang he-il">אלהים</span> in this passage. The <em>Septuagint </em>render it “God — <span class="lang el-gr">Θεον</span>,” the Targum, “judges,” but commentators generally “God,” <em>i.e.</em>, the true God, supposing the audacity of the people to be here reprobated. The word for “defraud or rob,” is only found here and in <span class="bvs">Pro_22:23</span>, and rendered “supplant” by the <em>Septuagint</em>, but “rob — <span class="lang el-gr">αποστερησει</span>,” by <em>Aq. </em>and <em>Sym</em>. , the only meaning consistent with the context. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(254)</strong> Literally it is, “in the tenth (or, tithe) and the heave-offering.” The last word comes from <span class="lang he-il">רם</span>, to raise or lift up, because this offering was raised or heaved, and thus presented as it were to the Lord. See <span class="bvs">Exo_29:27</span>. It is rendered “first-fruits” by the <em>Septuagint </em></p></div>
