<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet complains here that he and other teachers did but little, though their cry resounded and was heard by the whole people. He therefore says, that the <em>voice </em>of God <em>cried; </em>as though he had said that there was no excuse for ignorance, for God had indiscriminately exhorted them all to repentance. Now, since what was taught was common to them all, the Prophet deplores their perverseness, for very few were attentive; and the fable was sung, according to the proverb, to the deaf. We must then notice the word <em>cry; the voice </em>of God, he says, <em>crieth. </em>God did not whisper in the ear of one or two, but he designed his voice to be heard by all from the least to the greatest. The Prophets then did cry loud enough, but there were no ears to hear them. </p><p>We may take the word <span class="lang he-il">לעיר</span>, <em>laoir, </em>in two ways. <span class="lang he-il">עיר</span>, <em>oir, </em>means a city. But some derive it from <span class="lang he-il">עור</span>, <em>our, </em>and render it as if it were written <span class="lang he-il">להעיר</span>, <em>laeoir</em>. If <span class="lang he-il">ה</span>, <em>he </em>is put in, it must be rendered, <em>To rouse; </em>and the letter <span class="lang he-il">ה</span>, <em>he, </em>may be concealed under the point chamets; and this sense would be the most suitable, <em>The voice of Jehovah cries to arouse </em>or awaken; that is though the people are torpid, and as it were overpowered with sleep, for they indulged themselves in their sins; yet the voice of God ought to be sufficient to arouse them all: however sleepy they might have been, there was yet power enough in the doctrine of the Law, which the Prophet daily proclaimed. But still this voice, by which the whole people ought to have been awakened, was not heard! </p><p><em>The man of understanding, </em>he says <em>will see thy name </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">תושיה</span>, <em>tushie, </em>means properly understanding, as it is clear from many other passages; but the Prophet means that there was a very small number who were teachable; and he calls them men of understanding. At the same time, he indirectly reproves the sottishness of the people, though they all boasted that they were wise, and boasted also that they were the learners of the Law. The Prophet shows here by implication, that understanding was a rare thing among that people; for few hearkened to the voice of God. And thus we see what his object was; for he wished to touch the Jews to the quick, that they might acknowledge that they were without mind and understanding, because they had hardened themselves against God, so that his voice did not reach their hearts. He therefore shows that they were all besides themselves; for had they any right understanding, they would have hearkened to God speaking to them, as they were his disciples. What indeed could have been more strange, nay more inhuman, than for men to reject the doctrine of their salvation, and to turn aside from hearing even God himself? Thus the madness of the people was reproved; for though the voice of God sounded in the ears of them all, it was not yet listened to. </p><p>If one prefers reading, <em>In the city, </em>then no doubt the Prophet means, that the voice of God was proclaimed through all the cities: for to confine it, as some interpreters do, to Jerusalem, or to Samaria, appears frigid. We must then understand a change of number, and take city for any large concourse of people; as though he had said, that there was no city in which God did not cry and yet that there were ears no where. </p><p>It afterwards follows, <em>Shall see thy name</em>. Some render it, Shall fear, <span class="cite-ref">(171)</span> as though it was from <span class="lang he-il">ירא</span>, <em>ira</em>; but it comes on the contrary from <span class="lang he-il">ראה</span>, <em>rae</em>; and rules of grammar will not allow it to be viewed otherwise. And the Prophet speaks in a striking manner, when he says, that the <em>intelligent man seeth the name of God. </em>For whence proceeded the contempt of wicked men, so that they disregarded the voice of God, except from this — that his majesty had no effect on them; that is, they did not acknowledge that they had to do with God? For if they really understood what I have said, — that God spoke to them, his majesty would have immediately come to view, it would have arrested all their thoughts. God then would have constrained even the most heedless to fear him, had it not been, that they imagined the voice which sounded in their ears was that of man. Significantly then does the Prophet say, that it was the act of singular prudence to see the name of God, that is to understand from whom the doctrine proceeded. For as soon as we hearken to God, his majesty, as I have said, must so penetrate all our thoughts, as to humble us before him, and to constrain us to do him homage. The contempt then of spiritual doctrine, and also the perverseness of ungodly men, proceed from this, — that they see not the name of God, that they understand not that it is his name. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>Hear ye the rod, and </em>him <em>who proclaims it to you </em>By rod he means threatening; as though he said, — “Your arrogance in mocking God shall not go unpunished, as though his voice were an empty sound: there is then no reason for you to deceive yourselves with the hope of impunity; for God will avenge the contempt of his word.” Now the Prophet’s design was, to denounce an approaching vengeance on those who came not willingly to God, and received not his word with genuine docility of mind. Whenever, then, men despise the voice of God, as though it proceeded only from a mortal being, on such Micah denounces an impending vengeance; for the contempt of his word is a thing intolerable to God. This is the reason why he immediately adds, after having complained of the contempt of his word, that vengeance was not afar off; <em>Hear ye </em>then <em>the rod, and who declares or testifies concerning it </em></p><p>This last clause ought to be especially noticed; for the ungodly are not terrified when God declares that he will be an avenger, because they think not that they must give an account of their life, or they look only on mortal man, “Ah! who speaks? Is he indeed our God? Is he armed with celestial power? Do we not see a mortal man and one like ourselves?” We daily see that the ungodly do thus cast away every fear, and willfully harden themselves against God’s judgments. It is not then without reason that the Prophet bids the Jews seriously to consider <em>who testifies </em>of the rod; as though he said, — “I indeed confess that I am a mortal man, but remember who has sent me; for I go not forth as a private individual, nor have I presumptuously intruded into this office; but I am armed with God’s command; nay, God himself speaks through my mouth. If then ye despise me, the Lord is present, who will vindicate his own commands for he will not suffer himself to be despised in his servants though they may be contemptible according to the flesh, he will yet have the reverence which it deserves to be paid to his word.” We now perceive the real meaning of the Prophet. It now follows — </p><p><strong>(171)</strong> And so <em>Newcome </em>renders it, and there are a few copies in favor of this reading, in which <span class="lang he-il">יראי</span> is found: but a fact of this kind is not sufficient to make a change, except there will be other reasons. And then in the next line there is a change made, without the authority of one MS. Indeed these two lines are rendered as though the Archbishop had another text; and indeed it is another: his version is this, — </p><p><em>And </em>there is <em>a sound wisdom with them that fear his name: </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Hear, O ye tribes, him that testifieth. </em></p><p>This version is partly derived from the Septuagint; which could not have been wholly followed, as it differs so widely from the Hebrew, and hardly presents any meaning. There is far more correspondence in the passage, as it is rendered in our version, and by <em>Calvin, </em>and also by <em>Henderson; </em>and the Hebrew is closely followed. <em>Drusius </em>and others agree with <em>Calvin, </em>that <span class="lang he-il">תושיה</span>, which is rendered often “sound wisdom,” is to be taken here as concrete, signifying a wise man. <span class="lang he-il">מטה</span> is evidently the rod of correction, and is used in this sense in <span class="bvs">Isa_10:5</span>; and it is more consistent with the whole passage to consider <span class="lang he-il">יעדה</span> as a future, construed, as in the present tense, with an affix, from <span class="lang he-il">עד</span>, to testify, than from <span class="lang he-il">יעד</span> to appoint, — “Hear ye the rod,” the chastening rod, “and who testifies of it.” <em>Newcome </em>viewed it as being this verb; but he takes no notice of its affix <span class="lang he-il">ה</span>, which refers to the rod, by which chastisement is signified. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
