<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Five were wise. </em>Towards the close of the former chapter, our Lord specially required <em>steward </em>to be <em>wise, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_24:45</span>) for it is reasonable, that the heavier the charge which any man sustains, and the more important the matters in which he is employed, the <em>wisdom </em>with which he conducts himself should be the greater. But now he demands <em>wisdom </em>from all the children of God in general, that they may not, through inconsiderate rashness, expose themselves to be the prey of Satan. Now this kind of <em>wisdom </em>he describes by saying, that they are to provide themselves with the supplies necessary for completing the course of their life. For the warmth of our impatience makes us look upon the time, however short, as far too long protracted; and next, our poverty is such, that we need supplies for every hour. </p></div>
