<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Which is called Sichar </em>Jerome, in his epitaph on Paula, thinks that this is an incorrect reading, and that it ought to have been written <em>Sichem</em>; and, indeed, the latter appears to have been the ancient and true name; but it is probable that, in the time of the Evangelist, the word <em>Sichar </em>was already in common use. As to the place, it is generally agreed that it was a city situated close to Mount Gerizzim, the inhabitants of which were treacherously slain by Simeon and Levi, (<span class="bvs">Gen_34:25</span>,) and which Abimelech, a native of the place, afterwards razed to its thundations, (<span class="bvs">Jud_9:45</span>.) But the convenience of its situation was such that, a third time, a city was built there, which, in the age of Jerome, they called <em>Neapolis </em>By adding so many circumstances, the Apostle removes all doubt; for we are clearly informed by Moses where that field was which Jacob assigned to the children of Joseph, (<span class="bvs">Gen_48:22</span>.) It is universally acknowledged, also, that Mount Gerizzim was near to Shechem. We shall afterwards state that a temple was built there; and there can be no doubt that Jacob dwelt a long time in that place with his family. </p><p><em>And Jesus, fatigued by the journey. </em>He did not pretend weariness, but was actually fatigued; for, in order that he might be better prepared for the exercise of sympathy and compassion towards us, he took upon him our weaknesses, as the Apostle shows that </p><p>we have not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, (<span class="bvs">Heb_4:15</span>.) </p><p>With this agrees the circumstance of the time; for it is not wonderful that, being thirsty and<em>fatigued, </em>he rested at the well about noon; for as the day, from sunrise to sunset, had twelve hours, <em>the sixth hour </em>was<em>Noon </em>When the Evangelist says that <em>he sat </em>thus, he means that it was the attitude of a man who was<em>fatigued </em></p></div>
