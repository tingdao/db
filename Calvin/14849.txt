<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And they, whilst they seek, etc. </em>Here we find David rising to a more assured confidence, and triumphing as if he had already obtained the victory. And there is every reason to believe, that though he had escaped his difficulties, and was in circumstances of peace and prosperity when he wrote this psalm, yet he only expresses what he actually felt at the critical period when his life was in such imminent danger. He declares his conviction that the enemies who eagerly sought his life would be cut off; that God would cast them headlong into destruction; and that their very bodies should be left without burial. To be <em>the portion of foxes, </em><span class="cite-ref">(437)</span> is the same thing with being left to be torn and devoured by the <em>beasts of the field. </em>It is often denounced as one judgment which should befall the wicked, that they would perish by the sword, and become the prey of wolves and of dogs, without privilege of sepulture. This is a fate which the best of men have met with in the world, — for good as well as bad are exposed to the stroke of temporal evil; — but there is this distinction, that God watches over the scattered dust of his own children, gathers it again, and will suffer nothing of them to perish, whereas, when the wicked are slain, and their bones spread on the field, this is only preparatory to their everlasting destruction. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(437)</span> Under the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שועל</span>, <em>shual</em>, here rendered <em>fox</em>, was comprehended, in common language, <em>the jackal</em>, or <em>Vulpes aureus </em>,<em>golden wolf</em>, so called in Latin because its color is a bright yellow; and in this sense <span class="lang he-il">שועל</span>,<em>shual</em>, has been generally interpreted here, because the jackal is found in Palestine, and feeds on carrion. Both of these circumstances are, however, also applicable to the fox, and, moreover, Bochart has made it probable that the specific name of the jackal (the <span class="lang el-gr">θῶς</span> of the Greeks) in Hebrew was <span class="lang he-il">אי</span>, <em>aye</em>, <em>the howler</em>, being so called from the howling cry which he makes particularly at night. The term occurs in <span class="bvs">Isa_13:22</span>; and <span class="bvs">Jer_50:39</span>; where <span class="lang he-il">איים</span>, <em>ayim</em>, is rendered, in our version, “the wild beasts of the islands,” an appellation very vague and indeterminate. At the same time, it is highly probable that <em>shual </em>generally refers to the jackal. Several of the modern oriental names of this animal, as the Turkish <em>chical</em>, and the Persian <em>sciagal</em>, <em>sciachal</em>, or <em>schachal </em>— whence the English jackal — from their resemblance to the Hebrew word <em>shual</em>, favor this supposition; and Dr Shaw, and other travelers, inform us, that while jackals are very numerous in Palestine, the common fox is rarely to be met with. We shall, therefore, be more correct, under these circumstances, in admitting that the jackal of the East is the Hebrew <em>shual </em>These animals never go alone, but always associate in packs of from fifty to two hundred. They are known to prey on dead bodies; and so greedy are they of human carcases, that they dig them out of their graves, and devour them, however putrescent They have been seen waiting near the grave at the time of a funeral eagerly watching their opportunity of digging up the body almost as soon as it was buried. “I have known several instances,” says a traveler quoted by Merrick, “of their attacking and devouring drunken men, whom they have found lying on the road, and have heard that they will do the same to men that are sick and helpless. I have seen many graves that have been opened by the jackals, and parts of the bodies pulled out by them.” They visit the field of battle to prey upon the dying and the dead, and they follow caravans for the same purpose. It is usual with the barbarous nations of the East to leave the bodies of their enemies, killed in battle, in the field, to be devoured by jackals and other animals. When the Psalmist, therefore, says that his enemies would become <em>a portion for foxes</em>, the meaning is, that they would be denied the rites of sepulture, which was deemed a great calamity, — that they should be left unburied, for jackals and other wild beasts to prey upon and devour. </p></div></div>
