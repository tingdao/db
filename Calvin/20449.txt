<div class="comment-content"><p>He speaks here of the mendicity of the people, that they sought bread from every quarter. To give the hand, is explained in three ways: some say that it means humbly to ask; others, to make an agreement; and others, to extend it in token of misery, as he who cannot ask for help, intimates his wants by extending his hand. But the Prophet seems simply to mean that the people were so distressed by want, that they begged bread. I then take the expression, to give the hand, as meaning that they asked bread, as beggars usually do. </p><p>He now says that they <em>gave </em>or extended <em>the hand </em>both to the <em>Egyptians </em>and to the <em>Assyrians</em>, which was a most unworthy and disgraceful thing; for the Egyptians had been their most troublesome enemies, and the Assyrians afterwards followed their example.

How often is mention made by Moses of corn, wine, and oil; and why? in order that God might shew that that land exceeded every other in fertility.
