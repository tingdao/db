<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Then Judas, perceiving that he was condemned. </em>By this adverb (<span class="lang el-gr">τότε</span>) <em>then, </em>Matthewdoes not fix the exact point of time; for we shall find him shortly afterwards adding, that Judas, when he saw that the priests disdainfully refused to take back the reward of his treason, threw it down in the temple. But from the house of Caiaphas they came straight to the Pretorium, and stood there until Christ was condemned. It can scarcely be supposed that they were found in the temple on that day; but as the Evangelist was speaking of the rage and madness of the council, he inserted also the death of Judas, by which their blind obstinacy, and the hardness of their hearts like iron, were more fully displayed. </p><p>He says that Judas <em>repented; </em>not that he reformed, but that the crime which he had committed gave him uneasiness; as God frequently opens the eyes of the reprobate, so as to begin to feel their miseries, and to be alarmed at them. For those who are sincerely grieved so as to reform, are said not only (<span class="lang el-gr">μεταμελεῖν</span>), <span class="cite-ref">(241)</span> but, also (<span class="lang el-gr">μετανοεῖν</span>), <span class="cite-ref">(242)</span> from which is derived also (<span class="lang el-gr">μετάνοια</span>), <span class="cite-ref">(243)</span> which is a true conversion of the soul to God. So then, Judas conceived disgust and horror, not so as to turn to God, but rather that, being overwhelmed with despair, he might serve as an example of a man entirely shut out from the grace of God. Justly, indeed, does Paul say, that the sorrow which leads to repentance is salutary, (<span class="bvs">2Co_7:10</span>;) but if a man stumble at the very threshold, he will derive no advantage from a confused and mistaken grief. What is more, this is a just punishment with which God at length visits the wicked, who have obstinately despised his judgment, that he gives them up to Satan to be tormented without the hope of consolation. </p><p>True repentance is displeasure at sin, arising out of fear and reverence for God, and producing, at the same time, a love and desire of righteousness. Wicked men are far from such a feeling; for they would desire to sin without intermission, and even, as far as lies in their power, they endeavor to deceive both God and their own conscience, <span class="cite-ref">(244)</span> but notwithstanding their reluctance and opposition, they are tormented with blind horror by their conscience, so that, though they do not hate their sin, still they feel, with sorrow and distress, that it presses heavily and painfully upon them. This is the reason why their grief is useless; for they do not cheerfully turn to God, or even aim at doing better, but, being attached to their wicked desires, they pine away in torment, which they cannot escape. In this way, as I have just said, God punishes their obstinacy; for although his elect are drawn to him by severe chastisements, and as it were contrary to their will, yet he heals in due time the wounds which he has inflicted, so that they come cheerfully to him, by whose hand they acknowledge that they are struck, and by whose wrath they are alarmed. The former, therefore, while they have no hatred to sin, not only dread, but fly from the judgment of God, and thus, having received an incurable wound, they perish in the midst of their sorrows. </p><p>If Judas had listened to the warning of Christ, there would still have been place for repentance; but since he despised so gracious an offer of salvation, he is given up to the dominion of Satan, that he may throw him into despair. But if the Papists were right in what they teach in their schools about <em>repentance, </em>we could find no defect in that of Judas, to which their definition of <em>repentance </em>fully applies; for we perceive in it contrition of heart, and confession of the mouth, and satisfaction of deed, as they talk. Hence we infer, that they take nothing more than the bark; for they leave out what was the chief point, the conversion of the man to God, when the sinner, broken down by shame and fear, denies himself so as to render obedience to righteousness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(241)</span> The import of those Greek words is brought out more fully in our Author’s French version. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car ceux qui sont vrayement desplaisans pour s’amender, non seulement cognoissent leurs fautes, mais aussi changent de courage, ce qui est bien ici exprimé</span>;” — “for those who are truly dissatisfied with themselves so as to reform, not only know their faults, but also have the resolution to amend, which is well expressed here.” He then goes on to say that Matthew attributes to Judas “<span class="lang fr-fr">une repentance que les Grecs nomment</span><span class="lang el-gr">μεταμέλεια</span>, <span class="lang fr-fr">qui est forcee, et laisse l’homme tout abruti; non pas celle qu’ils nomment</span><span class="lang el-gr">μετάνοια</span>, <span class="lang fr-fr">qui est un vraye conversation de l’homme à Dieu</span>;” — “a repentance which the Greeks call <em>metameleia</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">μεταμέλεια</span>,) which is forced, and leaves the man altogether brutish; not that which they call <em>metanoia, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">μετάνοια</span>,) which is a true conversion of the man to God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(242)</span> The import of those Greek words is brought out more fully in our Author’s French version. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car ceux qui sont vrayement desplaisans pour s’amender, non seulement cognoissent leurs fautes, mais aussi changent de courage, ce qui est bien ici exprimé</span>;” — “for those who are truly dissatisfied with themselves so as to reform, not only know their faults, but also have the resolution to amend, which is well expressed here.” He then goes on to say that Matthew attributes to Judas “<span class="lang fr-fr">une repentance que les Grecs nomment</span><span class="lang el-gr">μεταμέλεια</span>, <span class="lang fr-fr">qui est forcee, et laisse l’homme tout abruti; non pas celle qu’ils nomment</span><span class="lang el-gr">μετάνοια</span>, <span class="lang fr-fr">qui est un vraye conversation de l’homme à Dieu</span>;” — “a repentance which the Greeks call <em>metameleia</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">μεταμέλεια</span>,) which is forced, and leaves the man altogether brutish; not that which they call <em>metanoia, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">μετάνοια</span>,) which is a true conversion of the man to God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(243)</span> The import of those Greek words is brought out more fully in our Author’s French version. “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car ceux qui sont vrayement desplaisans pour s’amender, non seulement cognoissent leurs fautes, mais aussi changent de courage, ce qui est bien ici exprimé</span>;” — “for those who are truly dissatisfied with themselves so as to reform, not only know their faults, but also have the resolution to amend, which is well expressed here.” He then goes on to say that Matthew attributes to Judas “<span class="lang fr-fr">une repentance que les Grecs nomment</span><span class="lang el-gr">μεταμέλεια</span>, <span class="lang fr-fr">qui est forcee, et laisse l’homme tout abruti; non pas celle qu’ils nomment</span><span class="lang el-gr">μετάνοια</span>, <span class="lang fr-fr">qui est un vraye conversation de l’homme à Dieu</span>;” — “a repentance which the Greeks call <em>metameleia</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">μεταμέλεια</span>,) which is forced, and leaves the man altogether brutish; not that which they call <em>metanoia, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">μετάνοια</span>,) which is a true conversion of the man to God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(244)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et Dieu, et leur propre conscience</span>.” </p></div></div>
