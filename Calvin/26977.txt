<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Thou hast made known. </em>He meaneth, that he was restored from death to life by the grace of God. For in that he was, as it were, a man raised from death to life, he acknowledgeth that it was a great good gift of God. This was in such sort fulfilled in Christ, that there wanted nothing unto perfection. As for the members they have their measure. Therefore Christ was far from corruption, that he may be the first-fruits of those which rise from death, (<span class="bvs">1Co_15:23</span>.) We shall follow him in our order at length, but being first turned into dust, (<span class="bvs">1Co_15:42</span>.) That which followeth, that<em>he was filled with gladness, </em>with the countenance of God, agreeth with that: Show us thy face, and we shall be safe. And, again, The light of thy countenance is showed upon us: thou hast put gladness in my heart. For it is only the pleasantness of Godâ€™s countenance, which doth not only make us glad, but also quickens us; again, when the same is turned away, or troubled, we must needs faint. </p></div>
