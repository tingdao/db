<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And found Mary </em>This was a revolting sight, and was sufficient of itself to produce an aversion to Christ. For what could be more improbable than to believe that he was the King of the whole people, who was deemed unworthy to be ranked with the lowest of the multitude? or to expect the restoration of the kingdom and salvation from him, whose poverty and want were such, that he was thrown into a stable? Yet Luke writes, that none of these things prevented the shepherds from admiring and praising God. The glory of God was so fully before their eyes, and reverence for his Word was so deeply impressed upon their minds, that the elevation of their faith easily rose above all that appeared mean or despicable in Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(167)</span> And the only reason why our faith is either retarded or driven from the proper course, by some very trifling obstacles, is, that we do not look steadfastly enough on God, and are easily “tossed to and fro,” (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:14</span>.) If this one thought were entirely to occupy our minds, that we have a certain and faithful testimony from heaven, it would be a sufficiently strong and firm support against every kind of temptations, and will sufficiently protect us against every little offense that might have been taken. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(167)</span> In the French copy he adds: “<span class="lang fr-fr">En sorte que cela ne les empesche point de recognoistre la hautesse de sa maiste divine</span>.” — “So that it does not hinder them from acknowledging the height of his divine majesty.” </p></div></div>
