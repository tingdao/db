<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>If we have sown unto you spiritual things </em>There was one cavil remaining — for it might be objected, that labors connected with this life should without doubt have food and clothing as their reward; and that plowing and thrashing yield fruit, of which those that labor in these things are partakers; but that it is otherwise with the gospel, because its fruit is spiritual; and hence the minister of the word, if he would receive fruit corresponding to his labor, ought to demand nothing that is carnal. Lest any one, therefore, should cavil in this manner, he argues from the greater to the less. “Though food and clothing are not of the same nature with a minister’s labors, what injury do you sustain, if you recompense what is inestimable with a thing that is small and contemptible? For in proportion to the superiority of the soul above the body, does the word of the Lord excel outward sustenance, <span class="cite-ref">(486)</span> inasmuch as it is the food of the soul.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(486)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et le vestement</span>;” — “And clothing.” </p></div></div>
