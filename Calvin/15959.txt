<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>60.</strong><em>I made haste </em>Though the words are in the past tense, they denote a continued act. The prophet declares with what promptitude he dedicated himself to the service of God. Diligence and dispatch demonstrate the favor of his zeal. Next, in saying that he <em>delayed not, </em><span class="cite-ref">(422)</span> this, according to the Hebrew idiom, gives intensity to the idea conveyed by the phrase, <em>I made haste </em>As among the Hebrews, <em>to speak and not to keep silence </em>is equivalent to speaking freely, unreservedly, and without dissimulation, as the occasion demands, so to <em>make haste and not delay </em>is to run quickly without doubt or delay. If we reflect on our own listlessness, and on the snares which Satan never fails to put in our way, we will at once perceive that these words are not added in vain. For let a man be ever so desirous of applying himself truly and heartily to the righteousness of God, yet, according to Paul, we know that <em>“ </em>he does not the thing that he would,” (<span class="bvs">Rom_7:15</span>). Although no outward obstacle may stand in our way, yet we are so retarded by impediments within, that nothing is more difficult than to make haste to keep the law of God. At the same time we must remember, that the prophet is here speaking comparatively in reference to those who are chargeable with procrastination during the greater part of their life, and who draw near to God, not only hesitatingly and tardily, but also purposely loiter in their course, or else prevent themselves from coming by their tortuous ways. The prophet did not manifest more alacrity in serving God than Paul; all he intends, therefore, is, that having surmounted all obstacles which lay in his way, he prosecuted his journey with rapidity. And by his example he teaches us, that the pleas which we offer in extenuation of our indolence, either arising from the impediments presented by the world or our own infirmity, are vain and frivolous. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(422)</span> “The original word, which we translate <em>delayed not</em>, is amazingly emphatical. <span class="lang he-il">ולא התמהמהתי</span><em>velo hethmahmaheti</em>, I did not stand <em>what</em>, <em>what</em>, <em>whating</em>; or, as we used to express the same sentiment, <em>shilly </em>-<em>shallying </em>with myself; I was <em>determined</em>, and so set out. The <em>Hebrew </em>word, as well as the <em>English</em>, strongly marks indecision of mind, positive action being suspended, because the mind is so unfixed as not to be able to make a choice.” — <em>Dr Adam Clarke </em></p></div></div>
