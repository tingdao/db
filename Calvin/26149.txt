<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>You are witnesses to me. </em>John expostulates with his disciples that they did not give credit to his statements. He had often warned them that he was not the Christ; and, therefore, it only remained that he should be a servant and subject to the Son of God along with others. And this passage is worthy of notice; for, by affirming <em>that he is not the Christ</em>, he reserves nothing for himself but to be subject to the head, and to serve in the Church as one of the rest, and not to be so highly exalted as to obscure the honor of the Head. He says that <em>he was sent before, </em>to prepare the way for Christ, as kings are wont to have heralds or forerunners. </p></div>
