Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that <em>Peter and John </em>return home, while they are still in doubt and perplexity; for in some passages John had employed this phraseology, when lie intended to describe the increase of faith. Besides, <span class="bvs">Luk_24:12</span> relates that <em>Peter wondered </em>at seeing the sepulcher in such good order; meaning by this, that Peter thought of something greater and loftier than what Mary had told him. </p></div>
