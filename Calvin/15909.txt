<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>With my whole heart </em>Conscious of the integrity of his heart, the prophet still implores the help of God, that he might not stumble by reason of his infirmity. He makes no boast of self-preparation, as if he had spontaneously begun to inquire after God, but in praising the grace which he had experienced, he at the same time aspires after steadfastness to persevere in walking in his ways. It is folly on the part of the Papists to seize upon this and similar passages, as if the saints, of their own free will, anticipated the grace of the Holy Spirit, and afterwards were favored with his aid. The prophet does not make a division between God and himself, but rather prays God to continue his work till it is completed, agreeably with what we are generally taught, to keep God mindful of his benefits until he accomplish them. </p><p>In the meantime, there is good cause for presenting our supplication to God, to stretch out his hand towards us when he sees our minds so settled, that we are solicitous of nothing so much as acting uprightly. And as he elevates us with confidence to ask the gift of perseverance, when he inspires our hearts with proper affection towards him, so also does he entreat us for the future not to sink into a careless and languid state like soldiers who have been discharged, but seek to be constantly directed by the spirit of wisdom, and to be sustained by the principles of fortitude and virtue. David here, from his own example, points out to us a rule, that by how much a man finds himself succored by God, by so much ought he to be induced the more carefully and earnestly to implore the continuance of his aid; for unless he restrain us, we will instantly wander and go astray. This sentiment is more explicitly stated in the original word <span class="lang he-il">תשגני</span>, <em>tashqeni, </em>which is in the passive voice, and signifies, <em>to be led astray </em><span class="cite-ref">(403)</span> From the import of the term, I do not mean to establish the doctrine that God secretly incites us to commit sin, but only to let my readers know, that such is our liability to err, that we immediately relapse into sin the instant he leaves us to ourselves. This passage also admonishes us that the man who swerves but a little from God’s commandments is guilty of going astray. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(403)</span> “The Hebrew <span class="lang he-il">תשגני</span> is here in the conjugation Hiphil, from <span class="lang he-il">שגה</span>, <em>to be ignorant </em>or <em>err</em>. Now of that conjugation the Hebrews observe, that as it signifies sometimes no more than <em>to permit</em>, so it sometimes notes <em>to cause</em>, sometimes <em>to occasion</em>, that which the verb imports.” — <em>Hammond </em></p></div></div>
