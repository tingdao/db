<div class="comment-content"><p>The injunctions which Matthew has hitherto related had no farther reference than to that former expedition or commission, which was to be terminated in a few days. But now Christ proceeds farther, and prepares them for a future period, by informing them, that they were not merely chosen for that brief exercise of preaching, but that an office of greater difficulty and of far higher importance awaited them. Though they were not immediately brought into those contests of which Christ speaks, yet it was advantageous for them to have previous warning, that any uneasiness which they might then suffer might be known to be a sort of preparative for a fiercer warfare to which they had been destined. It was no doubt true in reference to the first mission, that the apostles were <em>like sheep in the midst of wolves: </em>but as the Lord spared their weakness, and restrained the cruelty of <em>the wolves </em>from doing them any injury, these words properly relate to a subsequent period, when the Lord treated them more harshly. Before his resurrection, while <em>the bridegroom </em>was present, they were treated, so to speak, like guests at a marriage: but after the departure of <em>the bridegroom, </em>that softness and gentleness ceased, and they were reduced to such hardships as made them aware, that there were good reasons why they had been early furnished with those arms. </p><p>Perhaps, too, Matthew may have collected into one passage discourses which were delivered at different times: for Luke, as we shall afterwards see, (<span class="bvs">Luk_10:17</span>) relates that the same things were said to the <em>seventy </em>disciples, who were placed in the room of the apostles. One thing is beyond dispute: These words did not merely foretell the consequences of that journey which they were now commencing, but gave them warning as to the whole course of their apostleship. </p><p><span class="bvs">Mat_10:16</span><strong>.</strong><em>Behold, I send you out </em>The exhortation which immediately follows plainly shows the design of this admonition; and therefore the order of the passage must be explained in this manner: “You have need of <em>wisdom </em>and of <em>harmlessness, </em>because you will be <em>like sheep in the midst of wolves ” </em>The reason is drawn from the necessity of the case: for if they did not <em>wisely </em>exercise caution, they might be immediately devoured by the <em>wolves; </em>and, on the other hand, if they trembled at the rage of the <em>wolves, </em>or were incautious, they would presently waver, and would at length fail to perform their duty. </p><p>We shall first inquire what is meant by their being sent out <em>as sheep in the midst of wolves </em>Though men are cruel and bloody, the Lord might soften their ferocious temper; for he tames and subdues, whenever he pleases, the beasts of prey. When God does not subdue a considerable portion of mankind to the obedience of the gospels but leaves them in their own savage nature, he does it on purpose to try his ministers. Though all whom God does not regenerate with the spirit of gentleness are by nature <em>wolves </em>yet this designation is applied by Christ chiefly to the enraged enemies of the gospel, who are so far from being softened by hearing the voice of the pastor that they are inflamed to greater cruelty. The Lord sends the ministers of his word on the condition of dwelling <em>in the midst of wolves; </em>that is, of having many determined enemies and of being beset on every hand by many dangers, which render it no easy matter to discharge their duty in the midst of hindrances. To make the trial more severe, he does not supply them with defensive armor, but exposes them naked and defenseless to the teeth of the <em>wolves </em></p><p>By calling them <em>sheeps </em>he does not refer to the sweetness and mildness of their manners, or to the gentleness of their mind, but only means that they will have no greater strength or fitness for repelling the violence of enemies than <em>sheep </em>have against the rage of <em>wolves </em>Christ requires no doubt, from his disciples that they shall resemble <em>sheep </em>in their dispositions, by their patience in contending against the malice of wicked men, and by the meekness with which they endure injuries, but the simple meaning of this passage is, that many powerful and cruel enemies are arrayed against the apostles, while they, on their part, are furnished with no means of defense, <span class="cite-ref">(582)</span> If it be objected, that in this way there is no contrast between <em>sheep </em>and <em>wolves, </em>the reply is easy. Though the Lords by calling the enemies of the gospel <em>wolves, </em>expressed their power rather than their desire to do injury, yet as no man is known to be a <em>wolf </em>but by his rage against the gospel, Christ has joined these two things together, the fierce cruelty which impels them to shed blood, and the power with which they are armed. </p><p><em>Be therefore wise </em>The general meaning is, that their <em>wisdom </em>in exercising caution must be so regulated, as to prevent them from being more timid than is necessary, or from becoming more sluggish in duty. We see that those who wish to pass for cautious and circumspect persons are, for the most part, timorous and lazy. It is no doubt proper for the disciples of Christ, surrounded as they are by dangers on every hand, to maintain the strictest caution; but as they are in extreme danger of being kept back by slothfulness, he bids them move forward honestly wherever their calling leads them. </p><p>This is pointed out by a twofold comparison, <em>wise as serpents, and harmless as doves</em>. Serpents<em>, </em>being aware that they are hated, carefully avoid and shrink from every thing that is hostile to them. In this manner he enjoins believers to take care of their life, so as not to rush heedlessly into danger, or lay themselves open to any kind of injury. <em>Doves, </em>on the other hand, though naturally timid, and liable to innumerable attacks, fly in their simplicity, imagine themselves safe till they are struck, and in most cases place themselves within the reach of the fowler’s snares. To such simplicity Christ exhorts his disciples, that no excess of terror may hinder them from pursuing their course. There are some who carry their ingenious reasonings still farther as to the nature of the <em>serpent </em>and of the <em>dove, </em>but this is the utmost extent of the resemblance. We see that Christ condemns that carnal wisdom, or rather that trickery, in which the greater part of men are too fond of indulging, while they look around them on every hand to discover how far it will be safe for them to proceed; and thus, from an unwillingness to encounter danger, they renounce the call of Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(583)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(582)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien que de leur cost, ils n'ayent aucune force ou munition externe</span>;” — “while they, on their side, have no strength or outward protection.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(583)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils renoncent Christ et sa vocation</span>;” — “they renounce Christ and his calling.” </p></div></div>
