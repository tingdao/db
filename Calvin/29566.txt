With the view of increasing their alacrity, he declares that there is a mutual agreement, and harmony, as it were, between his preaching and their faith. For unless men, on their part, answer to God, no proficiency will follow from the grace that is offered to them — not as though they could do this of themselves, but inasmuch as God, as he begins our salvation by calling us, perfects it also by fashioning our hearts to obedience. The sum, therefore, is this — that an evidence of Divine election shewed itself not only in Paul’s ministry, in so far as it was furnished with the power of the Holy Spirit, but also in the faith of the Thessalonians, so that this conformity is a powerful attestation of it. He says, however, “Ye were imitators <em>of God and of us</em>, ” in the same sense in which it is said, that <em>the people believed God and his servant Moses</em>, (<span class="bvs">Exo_14:13</span><span class="cite-ref">(505)</span>) not as though Paul and Moses had anything different from God, but because he wrought powerfully by them, as his ministers and instruments. <span class="cite-ref">(506)</span><em>While ye embraced. </em>Their readiness in receiving the gospel is called an <em>imitation </em>of God, for this reason, that as God had presented himself to the Thessalonians in a liberal spirit, so they had, on their part, voluntarily come forward to meet him. </p><p>He says, <em>with the joy of the Holy Spirit</em>, that we may know that it is not by the instigation of the flesh, or by the promptings of their own nature, that men will be ready and eager to obey God, but that this is the work of God’s Spirit. The circumstance, that <em>amidst much tribulation </em>they had embraced the gospel, serves by way of amplification. For we see very many, not otherwise disinclined to the gospel, who, nevertheless, avoid it, from being intimidated through fear of the cross. Those, accordingly, who do not hesitate with intrepidity to embrace along with the gospel the afflictions that threaten them, furnish in this an admirable example of magnanimity. And from this it is so much the more clearly apparent, how necessary it is that the Spirit should aid us in this. For the gospel cannot be properly, or sincerely received, unless it be with a joyful heart. Nothing, however, is more at variance with our natural disposition, than to rejoice in afflictions. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(505)</span> This is what the original text reads; however, (<span class="bvs">Exo_14:31</span> would seem to be a more appropriate reference. — <em>fj. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(506)</span> See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 2, p. 288. </p></div></div>
