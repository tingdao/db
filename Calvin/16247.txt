<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? </em>I consider that David prosecutes the same idea of its being’ impossible that men by any subterfuge should elude the eye of God. By the <em>Spirit of God </em>we are not here, as in several other parts of Scripture, to conceive of his power merely, but his understanding and knowledge. <span class="cite-ref">(205)</span> In man the spirit is the seat of intelligence, and so it is here in reference to God, as is plain from the second part of the sentence, where by <em>the face of God </em>is meant his knowledge or inspection. David means in short that he could not change from one place to another without God seeing him, and following him with his eyes as he moved. They misapply the passage who adduce it as a proof of the immensity of God’s essence; for though it be an undoubted truth that the glory of the Lord fills heaven and earth, this was not at present in the view of the Psalmist, but the truth that God’s eye penetrates heaven and hell, so that, hide in what obscure corner of the world he might, he must be discovered by him. Accordingly he tells us that though he should fly to heaven, or lurk in the lowest abysses, from above or from below all was naked and manifest before God. <em>The wings of the morning, </em><span class="cite-ref">(206)</span> or of Lucifer, is a beautiful metaphor, for when the sun rises on the earth, it transmits its radiance suddenly to all regions of the world, as with the swiftness of flight. The same figure is employed in <span class="bvs">Mal_4:2</span>. And the idea is, that though one should fly with the speed of light, he could find no recess where he would be beyond the reach of divine power. For by <em>hand </em>we are to understand power, and the assertion is to the effect that should man attempt to withdraw from the observation of God, it were easy for him to arrest and draw back the fugitive. <span class="cite-ref">(207)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(205)</span> Some commentators suppose the third person of the Trinity to be here referred to. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(206)</span> Or “of the dawn of the morning.” <span class="lang he-il">שחר</span><em>, shachar, </em>the word employed, “is the light which is seen in the clouds before the rising of the sun, and it is like as if it; had wings to fly with haste; for in a moment the dawn of the morning is spread over the horizon, from the end of the east to that of the west.” —<em>Mendlessohn’s Beor. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(207)</span> Dathe understands <em>thy hand </em>of God’s gracious presence to defend the Psalmist; and such may be the meaning of the words. But whether we take them in this sense, or according to Calvin, as expressing man’s being under the power of God, in whatever part of the world he may be, they illustrate the divine omniscience, which Calvin regards as the chief design of the inspired writer. </p></div></div>
