<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Lord, save us </em>A pious prayer <span class="cite-ref">(538)</span>, one would think: for what else had they to do when they were lost than to implore safety from Christ? But as Christ charges them with unbelief, we must inquire in what respect they sinned. Certainly, I have no doubt that they attached too much importance to the bodily presence of their Master: for, according to Mark, they do not merely pray, but expostulate with him, <em>Master, hast thou no care that we perish? </em>Luke describes also confusion and trembling: <em>Master, Master, we perish </em>They ought to have believed that the Divinity of Christ was not oppressed by carnal sleep, and to his Divinity they ought to have had recourse. But they do nothing till they are urged by extreme danger; and then they are overwhelmed with such unreasonable fear that they do not think they will be safe <span class="cite-ref">(539)</span> till Christ is awakened. This is the reason why he accuses them of unbelief for their entreaty that he would assist them was rather a proof of their faith, if, in confident reliance on his divine power, they had calmly, and without so much alarm, expected the assistance which they asked. </p><p>And here we obtain an answer to a question which might be put, and which arises out of his reproof. Is every kind of fear sinful and contrary to faith? First, he does not blame them simply because they fear, but because they are <em>timid </em>Mark adds the word <span class="lang el-gr">οὕτω</span> — <em>Why are you </em>so <em>timid? </em>and by this term indicates that their alarm goes beyond proper bounds. Besides, he contrasts <em>faith </em>with their <em>fear, </em>and thus shows that he is speaking about immoderate dread, the tendency of which is not to exercise their faith, but to banish it from their minds. It is not every kind of fear that is opposed to faith. This is evident from the consideration that, if we fear nothing, an indolent and carnal security steals upon us; and thus faith languishes, the desire to pray becomes sluggish, and the remembrance of God is at length extinguished <span class="cite-ref">(540)</span> Besides, those who are not affected by a sense of calamities, so as to <em>fear, </em>are rather insensible than firm. </p><p>Thus we see that fear, which awakens faith, is not in itself faulty till it go beyond bounds. <span class="cite-ref">(541)</span> Its excess lies in disturbing or weakening the composure of faith, which ought to rest on the word of God. But as it never happens that believers exercise such restraint on themselves as to keep their faith from being injured, their fear is almost always attended by sin. Yet we ought to be aware that it is not every kind of fear which indicates a want of faith, but only that dread which disturbs the peace of the conscience in such a manner that it does not rest on the promise of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(538)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Une priere bonne et sainte</span>;” — “a good and holy prayer. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(539)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En sorte qu'il ne leur semble oint qu'il y ait moyen de les sauver, sinon que Christ s’eveeile</span>; — so that they think there will be no way of saving them till Christ is awakened.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(540)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et finalemeat la souvenance que chacun doit avoir de Dieu vient a s'esteindre</span>;” — and, finally, that remembrance of God which every one ought to have, comes to be extinguished.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(541)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Jusque ace qu'ellc passe mesurc, ct soit excessive</span>;” — “till it go beyond bounds, and become excessive.” </p></div></div>
