For the sake of modesty, however, he says that he <em>reckons </em>so, while the thing was known and manifest to all. His meaning, however, is, that God had honored his Apostleship with no less distinguished marks of favor, than that of John or Peter. Now the man that despises the gifts of God, which he himself recognizes, cannot clear himself from the charge of being spiteful and ungrateful. Hence, wherever you see the gifts of God, you must there reverence God himself: <span class="cite-ref">(813)</span> I mean, that every one is worthy of honor, in so far as he is distinguished by graces received from God, and especially if any advantage has redounded to thee from them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(812)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Monstroyent bien en cela leur ingratitude</span>;” — “Showed clearly in this their ingratitude.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(813)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">En quelque lieu que nous apperceuerons les dons de Dieu, il faut que la il soit honore de nous, et que nous luy portions reuerence</span>;” — “Wherever we recognise the gifts of God, he must there be honored by us, and we must give him reverence.” </p></div></div>
