<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>The king of Syria hath taken evil counsel against thee. </em>Though he foretold that empty would be the threats, and vain the attempts of the enemies of the people of God, yet he does not conceal that their devices are cruel, if the Lord do not restrain them. By <em>evil counsel </em>he means <em>destructive counsel</em>, for these two kings had leagued together to destroy Judea. To express it more fully, and to place it as it were before their eyes, he relates their very words. </p></div>
