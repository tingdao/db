<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>The eunuch said to Philip. </em>Here it appeareth what an earnest desire the eunuch had to learn. He wandereth in divers prophecies of Isaiah as through doubtful boughts, <span class="cite-ref">(561)</span> and yet he is not weary of reading. And whilst that he arrogateth nothing to himself, he getteth far more, contrary to his hope, even at a sudden, than he could get during his whole life by taking great pains, if he had brought all his quickness of wit. So the Lord will be unto us a Master, though we be but small, if, acknowledging our ignorance, we be not loth to submit ourselves to learn. And as the seed, covered with earth, lieth hid for a time, so the Lord will illuminate us by his Spirit, and will cause that reading which, being barren and void of fruit, causeth nothing but wearisomeness, to have plain light of understanding. The Lord doth never keep the eyes of his so shut, but that so soon as they are once entered, the way of salvation appeareth unto them in the Scripture; but that they profit ever now and then a little by reading. Yet doth he suffer them to stick fast oftentimes, and permitteth their course to be hindered by some bar which is laid in the way, both that he may try patience of faith in them, and also that he may teach them humility, by putting them in mind of their ignorance, that he may make them more attentive after that they have shaken off drowsiness; that he may make them more fervent in prayer; that he may prick them forward to love the truth more dearly; that he may set forth the excellence of his heavenly wisdom, which is otherwise not so esteemed as it ought. But howsoever the faithful do not attain unto the mark of perfect knowledge, yet they shall always perceive that their labor is not in vain, so that they stop not the way before themselves with proud loathsomeness. <span class="cite-ref">(562)</span> Let this going forward suffice us until the time of full revelation do come, that even a small taste of knowledge doth drip <span class="cite-ref">(563)</span> into us the fear of God and faith. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(561)</span> “Per dubias ambages,” through dubious, winding paths. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(562)</span> “Superbo fastidio,” by proud disdain, fastidiousness. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(563)</span> “Instillat,” instil. </p></div></div>
