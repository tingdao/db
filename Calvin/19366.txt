<div class="comment-content"><p>He then adds a comparison, answerable to that in the former clause, <em>He shall be like a tree planted by the waters, which sends its roots upon</em>, or nigh <em>the river, which shall not see when heat comes</em>. Here the Prophet points out the difference between the true servants of God, who trust in him, and those who are inflated with their own false imaginations, so that they seek safety either from themselves or from others: he had said of the unbelieving, that they are like tamarisks, which flourish for a time, but never bring forth any fruit, and are also soon dried up by the heat; but he says now as to the faithful, that they are like trees planted by the waters, and send their roots to the river. The tamarisks have the appearance of life, but there is no moisture in a dry soil; so their roots quickly dry up; but the servants of God, they are planted, as it were, in a moist soil, irrigated continually by streams of water. Hence the Prophet adds, that this tree <em>shall not see the heat when it comes </em></p><p>He indirectly intimates that God’s children are not exempt from adversities; for they feel the heat of the sun, like trees, who are exposed to it; but moisture is supplied, and the juice diffuses itself through all the branches: hence the Prophet says, that the leaf was <em>green</em>, even by means of the moisture which the earth supplied, being itself watered. The Prophet then intimates, that though God’s children feel great heats, as well as the unbelieving; for this is common to both, they shall yet be kept safe; for though the sun dries up by its great heat, there is yet a remedy; for the root has moisture, derived from the irrigation of water. </p><p>We now then see how suitable is every part of the comparison. He says farther, that it shall <em>not be careful</em>. The verb <span class="lang he-il">דאג</span>, <em>dag</em>, means to fear and to be careful; it means also sometimes to grieve, and so some render it here, “It will not grieve” but the other meaning seems better to me, — that the tree planted nigh streams of waters is <em>not afraid of heat</em>; and then he adds, <em>nor shall it cease from producing fruit </em><span class="cite-ref">(174)</span></p><p>Nearly the same similitude is found in <span class="bvs">Psa_1:3</span>, only that the fear of God and meditation on his law are mentioned, and not hope: </p><p>“Blessed is the man, etc., who meditates on the law of God;” </p><p>but Jeremiah speaks here expressly of the hope which ought to be put in God alone. Yet the two Prophets well agree together as to this truth, — that all their hopes are accursed, by which men inebriate themselves, while they seek salvation in themselves or in the world, and make more account of their own counsels, virtues, power, or the aids they expect from others, than of God himself and of his promises: for he who really meditates on the law of God day and night, well knows thereby, where to put his trust for salvation, both temporal and eternal. It follows — </p><p><strong>(174)</strong> The verbs here are all futures, but ought to be rendered in our language, as they are in <em>Syriac, </em>in the present tense, — </p><p>And he shall be like a tree <em>which is </em>planted by waters, And nigh the stream sends forth its roots, Which perceives not when heat comes; And its leaf is flourishing, And in the year of drought it suffers not, And never ceases from bringing forth fruit. </p><p>The verb <span class="lang he-il">דאג</span>, when applied to the mind, means agitation, commotion, trouble, disturbance: but here, as applied to a tree, it must mean a withering effect, a disturbance as to the process of growing. Joined with a negative, it may therefore be rendered, “it suffers not,” or, it withers not, according to the <em>Targum, </em>which applies it to the <em>leaf, </em>but not correctly. “It will not fear” is the rendering of the <em>Septuagint; </em>of the <em>Vulgate, </em>“it will not be careful,” as in our version; and of <em>Blayney, </em>“it is without concern.” None of these give the secondary meaning of the verb, which it evidently has here. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
