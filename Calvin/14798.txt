<div class="comment-content"><p>In the verse which follows, he describes their fierceness. The expression, <em>prating, </em>or belching out with their mouth, denotes that they proclaimed their infamous counsels openly, and without affecting concealment. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">נבע</span>, <em>nabang, </em>means, metaphorically, <em>to speak, </em>but properly, it signifies <em>to gush out, </em><span class="cite-ref">(364)</span> and here denotes more than simply speaking. He would inform us, that not content with plotting the destruction of the innocent secretly amongst themselves, they published their intentions abroad, and boasted of them. Accordingly, when he adds, that <em>swords were in their lips, </em>he means that they breathed out slaughter, and that every word they spoke was a sword to slay the oppressed. He assigns as the cause of their rushing to such excess of <em>wickedness, </em>that they had no reason to apprehend disgrace. It may be sufficiently probable, that David adverts here, as in many other places, to the gross stupidity of the wicked, who, in order to banish fear from their minds, conceive of God as if he were asleep in heaven; but I am of opinion that he rather traces the security with which they prosecuted their counsels, and openly proclaimed them, to the fact, that they had long ere now been in possession of the uncontrolled power of inflicting injury. They had succeeded so completely in deceiving the people, and rendering David odious by their calumnies, that none had the courage to utter a word in his defense. Nay, the more atrociously that any man might choose to persecute this victim of distress, from no other motive than to secure the good graces of the king, the more did he rise in estimation as a true friend to the commonwealth. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(364)</span> Ainsworth reads, “<em>to utter </em>or <em>well out</em>, as from a fountain;<em>belch </em>or<em>babble</em>, as <span class="bvs">Pro_15:2</span>, ‘As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her malice.’” “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le mot Hebrieu signifie </span><em class="lang fr-fr">se repandre en paroles </em>,etc.;” <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , “The Hebrew word signifies <em>to break out in words</em>, and it here denotes the oft repeated and passionate expressions which proceed from the mouth of persons actuated by hatred and rage, as in <span class="bvs">Psa_94:4</span>. To it the word <em>bark </em>answers very well, which is borrowed from dogs, and expresses the noise made by these animals; and this word is here the more apposite, that David in the preceding verse compares his enemies to dogs which incessantly run about and do nothing but bark.” —<em>Martin</em>. </p></div></div>
