<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_22:19</span><strong>.</strong><em>Which is given for you. </em>The other two Evangelists leave out this clause, which, however, is far from being superfluous; for the reason why the flesh of Christ becomes <em>bread </em>to us is, that by it salvation was once procured for us. And as the crucified flesh itself is of no advantage but to those who <em>eat </em>it by faith, so, on the other hand, the <em>eating </em>of it would be unmeaning, and of hardly any value, were it not in reference to the sacrifice which was once offered. Whoever then desires that the flesh of Christ should afford nourishment to him, let him look at it as having been offered on the cross, that it might be the price of our reconciliation with God. But what Matthew and Mark leave out in reference to the symbol of <em>bread, </em>they express in reference to the <em>cup, </em>saying, that <em>the blood was to be shed for the remission of sins; </em>and this observation must be extended to both clauses. So then, in order that we may feed aright on the flesh of Christ, we must contemplate the sacrifice of it, because it was necessary that it should have been once given for our salvation, that it might every day be given to us. </p></div>
