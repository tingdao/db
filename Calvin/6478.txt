<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And Joshua gathered all the tribes, </em>etc He now, in my opinion, explains more fully what he before related more briefly. For it would not have been suitable to bring out the people twice to a strange place for the same cause. Therefore by the repetition the course of the narrative is continued. And he now states what he had not formerly observed, that they were all standing before the Lord, an expression which designates the more sacred dignity and solemnity of the meeting. I have accordingly introduced the expletive particle <em>Therefore, </em>to indicate that the narrative which had been begun now proceeds. For there cannot be a doubt that Joshua, in a regular and solemn manner, invoked the name of Jehovah, and, as in his presence, addressed the people, so that each might consider for himself that God was presiding over all the things which were done, and that they were not there engaged in a private business, but confirming a sacred and inviolable compact with God himself. We may add, as is shortly afterwards observed, that there was his sanctuary. Hence it is probable that the ark of the covenant was conveyed thither, not with the view of changing its place, but that in so serious an action they might sist themselves before the earthly tribunal of God. <span class="cite-ref">(196)</span> For there was no religious obligation forbidding the ark to be moved, and the situation of Sichem was not far distant. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(196)</span> Latin, “Terrestre Dei tribunal.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le siege judicial que Dieu avoit en terre</span>;” “The judicial seat which God had on earth.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
