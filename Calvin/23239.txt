<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Happy are they that mourn. </em>This statement is closely connected with the preceding one, and is a sort of appendage or confirmation of it. The ordinary belief is, that calamities render a man unhappy. This arises from the consideration, that they constantly bring along with them <em>mourning </em>and grief. Now, nothing is supposed to be more inconsistent with happiness than <em>mourning. </em>But Christ does not merely affirm that <em>mourners </em>are not unhappy. He shows, that their very <em>mourning </em>contributes to a <em>happy </em>life, by preparing them to receive eternal joy, and by furnishing them with excitements to seek true <em>comfort </em>in God alone. Accordingly, Paul says, </p><p>“We glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation produces patience, and patience experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not ashamed,” (<span class="bvs">Rom_5:3</span>.) </p></div>
