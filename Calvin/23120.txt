<div class="comment-content"><p>Here again the Prophet exaggerates the crime which the priests regarded as nothing; for he says, that they sinned more grievously than if they had repudiated their wives. We indeed know that repudiation, properly speaking, had never been allowed by God; for though it was not punished under the law, yet it was not permitted. <span class="cite-ref">(236)</span> It was the same as with a magistrate, who is constrained to bear many things which he does not approve; for we cannot so deal with mankind as to restrain all vices. It is indeed desirable, that no vice should be tolerated; but we must have a regard to what is possible. Hence Moses has specified no punishment, according to the heinousness of the crime, if one repudiated his wife; and yet it was never permitted. </p><p>But if a comparison be made, Malachi says, that it is a lighter crime to dismiss a wife than to marry many wives. We hence learn how abominable polygamy is in the sight of God. I do not consider polygamy to be what the foolish Papists have made it, who call not those polygamists who have many wives at the same time, but those who marry another when the former one is dead. This is gross ignorance. Polygamy, properly so called, is when a person takes many wives, as it was commonly done in the East: and those nations, we know, have always been libidinous, and never observe the marriage vow. As then their lasciviousness was so great that they were like brute beasts, every one married several wives; and this abuse continues at this day among the Turks and the Persian and other nations. Here, however, where God compares polygamy with divorce, he says that polygamy is the worse and more detestable crime; for the husband impurely connects himself with another woman, and then, not only deals unfaithfully with his wife to whom he is bound, but also forcibly detains her: thus his crime is doubled. For if he replies and says that he keeps the wife to whom he is bound, he is yet an adulterer as to the second wife: thus he blends, as they say, holy with profane things; and then to adultery and lasciviousness he adds cruelty, for he holds under his authority a miserable woman, who would prefer death to such a condition; for we know what power jealousy has over women. And when any one introduces a harlot, how can a lawful wife bear such an indignity without being miserably tormented? </p><p>This then is the reason why the Prophet now says, <em>If thou hatest, dismiss</em>; not that he grants indulgence to divorce, as we have said, but that he might by this circumstance enhance the crime; and hence he adds, <em>For he covers by a cloak his violence</em>. Some interpreters take violence here for spoil or prey, and think that the wife is thus called who is tyrannically compelled to remain with an adulterer, when yet she sees a harlot in her house, by whom she is driven from her conjugal bed: but this is too strained and too remote from the letter of the text. The Prophet here, I doubt not, shakes off from the Jews their false mask, because they thought that they could cover over their vice by retaining their first wives. “What else is this,” he says, “but to cover by a cloak your violence, or at least to excuse it? for ye do not openly manifest it: but God is not deceived, nor can his eye be dazzled by such a disguise: though then your iniquity is covered by a cloak, it is not yet hid from God; nay, it is thus doubled, because ye exercise your cruelty at home; for it would be better for robbers to remain in the wood and there to kill strangers, than to entice guests to their houses and to kill them there and to plunder them under the pretext of hospitality. This is the way in which you act; for ye destroy the bond of marriage, and ye afterwards deceive your miserable wives, and yet ye force them by your tyranny to continue at your houses, and thus ye torment your miserable wives, who might have enjoyed their freedom, if divorce had been granted them.” <span class="cite-ref">(237)</span></p><p>He concludes again with these words, <em>Watch over your spirit</em>; that is, “Take heed; for this is an intolerable wickedness before God, however you may endeavor to extenuate its heinousness.” </p><p><strong>(236)</strong> This is not strictly correct, see <span class="bvs">Deu_24:2</span>; and our Savior allows that Moses “suffered” the Israelites to put away their wives, though he says that is was for the hardness of their hearts. See <span class="bvs">Mat_19:8</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(237)</strong> The interpretation given of the first clause of this verse is according to the <em>Septuagint </em>and the <em>Targum</em>, and has been adopted by <em>Cyril</em>, <em>Jerome</em>, <em>Theodoret</em>, <em>Drusius</em>, <em>Grotius</em>, <em>Dathius</em>, and others. Our version is derived from <em>Jun</em>. and <em>Trem., </em>and <em>Piscator</em>, and has been followed by <em>Marckius</em>, <em>Lowth</em>, <em>Scott</em>, <em>Adam Clarke</em>, <em>Newcome</em>, and <em>Henderson</em>. The second clause has been variously interpreted both by the ancients and the moderns. The <em>Septuagint </em>make “violence,” or wrong, the nominative to “cover,” and the <em>Targum </em>the accusative. “Iniquity shall cover his garment,” is the version of <em>Jerome</em>. “For he covers violence <em>as </em>with his garments,” has been the version of others; which corresponds with the <em>Targum</em>, as the former does with the <em>Septuagint</em>. </p><p>The most natural construction of the first part is no doubt what our version exhibits; the meaning of the second is less obvious: but they seem connected. What seems to be said is, — that God hates the divorcer, and him also who maltreats his wife without divorcing her. Then we may give this literal rendering, — </p><p>For he hates the divorcer, (or him who puts away,) Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel; And the coverer of outrage on his own garment, Saith Jehovah of hosts. </p><p>To speak of God here in the third person is in accordance with the preceding verses. “His own garment,” according to <em>Venema</em>, <em>Dathius</em>, and <em>Henderson</em>, is a figurative designation of a wife. See <span class="bvs">Rut_3:9</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_16:8</span>. </p><p>The condemning of divorce is more suitable to this place, than any reference to its permission; because in the previous part the allusion is evidently made to the first institution of marriage, and not to any posterior modification. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
