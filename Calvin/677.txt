<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>He died in the presence of all his brethren </em><span class="cite-ref">(25)</span> The major part of commentators understand this of his <em>death</em>; as if Moses had said that the life of Ishmael was shorter than that of his brethren, who long survived him: but because the word <span class="lang he-il">נפל</span> (<em>naphal</em>) is applied to a violent death, and Moses testifies that Ishmael died a natural death, this exposition cannot be approved. The Chaldean Paraphrast supposes the word “<em>lot </em>” to be understood, and elicits this sense, that the <em>lot fell </em>to him, so as to assign him a habitation not far from his brethren. Although I do not greatly differ in this matter, I yet think that the words are not to be thus distorted. <span class="cite-ref">(26)</span> The word <span class="lang he-il">נפל</span> (<em>naphal</em>) sometimes signifies to lie down, or to rest, and also to dwell. The simple assertion therefore of Moses is, that a habitation was given to Ishmael opposite his brethren, so that he should indeed be a neighbor to them, and yet should have his distinct boundaries: <span class="cite-ref">(27)</span> for I do not doubt that he referred to the oracle contained in the sixteenth chapter (<span class="bvs">Gen_16:1</span>) where, among other things, the angel said to his mother Hagar, He shall remain, or pitch his tents in the <em>presence of his brethren</em>. Why does he rather speak thus of Ishmael than of the others, except for this reason, that whereas they migrated towards the eastern region, Ishmael, although the head of a nation, separated from the sons of Abraham, yet retained his dwelling in their neighborhood? Meanwhile the intention of God is also to be observed, namely, that Ishmael, though living near his brethren, was yet placed apart in an abode of his own, that he might not become mingled with them, but might dwell in their presence, or opposite to them. Moreover, it is sufficiently obvious that the prediction is not to be restricted <em>personally </em>to Ishmael. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(25)</span> “Coram omnibus fratribus suis habitavit.” He dwelt in the presence of all his brethren. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(26)</span> This is the interpretation of Vatablus, favored by Professor Bush, who says, “As Ishmael’s death has already been mentioned, and as the term ‘fall’ is seldom used in the Scriptures in reference to ‘dying,’ except in cases of sudden and violent death, as when one ‘falls’ in battle, the probability is, that it here signifies that his territory or possessions ‘fell’ to him in the presence of his brethren, or immediately contiguous to their borders.” — <em>Bush</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(27)</span> Calvin’s interpretation, though opposed to the Vulgate and to our own version, is supported by the Septuagint, the Targum Onkelos, the Syriac, and Arabic versions.
