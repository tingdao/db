<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>For what knowest thou, O woman? </em>Those who are of opinion that this observation is a confirmation of the <em>second </em>department of his statement, expound it thus. “An uncertain hope ought not to detain thee,” etc. But, in my opinion, the exhortation is taken from the advantage to be derived; for it is a great and distinguished blessing if a wife <em>gain </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_9:19</span>) her husband. Now, unbelievers are not in so hopeless a condition but that they may be brought to believe. They are dead, it is true, but God can even raise the dead. So long, therefore, as there remains any hope of doing good, and the pious wife knows not but that she may by her <em>holy conversation </em>(<span class="bvs">1Pe_3:1</span>) bring back her husband into the way, <span class="cite-ref">(404)</span> she ought to try every means before leaving him; for so long as a man’s salvation is doubtful, it becomes us to be prepared rather to hope the best. </p><p>As to his saying, however, that <em>a husband may be saved by his wife</em>, the expression, it is true, is not strictly accurate, as he ascribes to man what belongs to God; but there is no absurdity in it. For as God acts efficaciously by his instruments which he makes use of, he does, in a manner, communicate his power to them, or, at least, he connects it with their service in such a manner, that what he does he speaks of as being done by them, and hence, too, he sometimes ascribes to them the honor which is due to himself alone. Let us, however, bear in mind, that we have nothing in our power, except in so far as we are directed by him as instruments. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(404)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Au bon chemin</span>;” — “Into the good way.” </p></div></div>
