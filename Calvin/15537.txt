<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>And the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah </em>The prophet here describes the fruit which would result from the deliverance of the ancient tribes; which is, that thereby Godâ€™s glory would be rendered illustrious among nations and kings. He tacitly intimates, that when the Church is oppressed, the Divine glory is at the same time debased; even as the God of Israel was, no doubt, at the period referred to, derided by the ungodly, as if he had been destitute of the power to succor his people. It is therefore declared, that if he redeem them, it will afford such a remarkable proof of his power as to constrain the Gentiles to reverence him whom they contemned. </p></div>
