<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>In that day you shall ask in my name. </em>He again repeats the reason why the heavenly treasures were then to be so bountifully opened up. It is, because <em>they ask in the name of Christ </em>whatever they need, and God will refuse nothing that shall be asked <em>in the name </em>of his Son. But there appears to be a contradiction in the words; for Christ immediately adds, that it will be unnecessary for him <em>to pray to the Father </em>Now, what purpose does it serve to pray <em>in his name</em>, if he does not undertake the office of Intercessor? In another passage John calls him <em>our Advocate</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Jo_2:1</span>.) Paul also testifies that Christ now <em>intercedes </em>for <em>us</em>, (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:34</span>;) and the same thing is confirmed by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, who declares that Christ <em>always liveth to make intercession for us</em>, (<span class="bvs">Heb_7:25</span>.) I reply, Christ does not absolutely say, in this passage, that he will not be Intercessor, but he only means, that <em>the Father </em>will be so favorably disposed towards the disciples, that, without any difficulty, he will give freely whatever they shall ask. “<em>My Father</em>, ” he says, “will meet you, and, on account of the great love which he bears towards you, will anticipate the Intercessor, who, otherwise, would speak on your behalf.” </p><p>Besides, when Christ is said to intercede with <em>the Father </em>for <em>us</em>, let us not indulge in carnal imaginations about him, as if he were on his knees before <em>the Father</em>, offering humble supplication in our name. But the value of his sacrifice, by which he once pacified God toward us, is always powerful and efficacious; the blood by which he atoned for our sins, the obedience which he rendered, is a continual intercession for us. This is a remarkable passage, by which we are taught that we have the heart of the Heavenly Father, <span class="cite-ref">(104)</span> as soon as we have placed before Him <em>the name </em>of his Son. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(104)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le coeur du Pere celeste</span>.” </p></div></div>
