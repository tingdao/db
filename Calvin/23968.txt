<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_24:10</span><strong>.</strong><em>Then will many be offended. </em>He now enumerates the temptations which will arise from bad examples. Now this is an exceedingly violent temptation, and difficult to overcome; for Christ is to many <em>a stone of offense, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Pe_2:8</span>,) on which some dash themselves, or by meeting which some are thrown back, and others fall away. In this expression Christ appears to me to include many kinds of troubles; for not only do they that had entered into the right course fall away, but many are exasperated against Christ; others, forgetful of moderation and justice, break out into rage; others grow profane, and lose every feeling of piety; and others, amidst the confusion which prevails, take upon themselves a liberty to commit crimes. </p></div>
