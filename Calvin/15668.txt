<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And they envied </em>He refers here very shortly to another transgression, and that, too, in such a way as to furnish both to himself and others ample grounds for deep consideration. For, as the people, in devising from time to time new modes of sinning, displayed so much cunning in their attempts to provoke God’s anger, so we ought the more to be filled with fear on that account. Moreover, when he says that they <em>envied Moses and Aaron, </em>his meaning is, that, acting under the influence of diabolic pride, they had risen up against God, and were endeavoring to throw off the yoke which he had laid upon them; according as Moses also said, </p><p>“What am I, and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against us?” (<span class="bvs">Num_16:11</span>) </p><p>As it was the will of God to rule the people by means of Moses and Aaron, not to submit to their rule was virtually to set themselves obstinately to resist the authority of God himself. There is therefore great importance attached to the term, <em>envy, </em>namely, that at the very time when God was treating the children of Israel with the utmost kindness and care, they yet were discontented with their lot, and rebelled against him. Could such madness serve any other purpose than to show, that, casting off all farther dependence upon the providence of God for their support, they aspire to rise above the very heavens? In this sense Aaron is called <em>the saint of Jehovah, </em><span class="cite-ref">(247)</span> in order that we might know that both he and Moses were equally identified with God; for under the person of the one, the designation is applied to both, and in this way the prophet shows that they had been Divinely invested with that authority which they were exercising. In renouncing their authority, therefore, and, to the utmost of their power, dishonoring these saints, Dathan and Abiram were rebelling not against men, but against God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(247)</span> “The <em>saint, i.e</em>. , a man consecrated with holy oil to the office of the priesthood, and wearing on his mitre a plate inscribed, ‘Holiness to the Lord,’ (<span class="bvs">Exo_28:36</span>)” — <em>Cresswell. </em><span class="lang he-il">קדוש יהוה</span><em>, holy of the Lord. </em>Aaron is thus called, because he was separated from the whole congregation of Israel, and appointed to direct the public worship, and to offer the sacrifices.
