<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>They went down into the water. </em>Here we see the rite used among the men of old time in baptism; for they put all the body into the water. Now the use is this, that the minister doth only sprinkle the body or the head. But we ought not to stand so much about such a small difference of a ceremony, that we should therefore divide the Church, or trouble the same with brawls. We ought rather to fight even an hundred times to death for the ceremony itself of baptism, inasmuch as it was delivered us by Christ that that we should suffer the same to be taken from us. But forasmuch as we have as well a testimony of our washing, as of newness of life, in the figure of water; forasmuch as Christ representeth unto us his blood in the water as in a glass, that we may fet <span class="cite-ref">(566)</span> our cleanness thence; forasmuch as he teacheth that we are fashioned again by his Spirit, that being dead to sin, we may live to righteousness; it is certain that we want nothing which maketh to the substance of baptism. Wherefore the Church did grant liberty to herself, since the beginning, to change the rites somewhat, excepting this substance. For some dipped them thrice, some but once. Wherefore there is no case why we should be so straitlaced in matters which are of no such weight; <span class="cite-ref">(567)</span> so that external pomp do no whit pollute the simple institution of Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(566)</span> “Petamus,” seek. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(567)</span> “Non ita necessariius,” not absolutely necessary. </p></div></div>
