<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>For the husband is the head of the wife. </em>This is the reason assigned why wives should be obedient. Christ has appointed the same relation to exist between a husband and a wife, as between himself and his church. This comparison ought to produce a stronger impression on their minds, than the mere declaration that such is the appointment of God. Two things are here stated. God has given to the husband authority over the wife; and a resemblance of this authority is found in Christ, who <em>is the head of the church, </em>as the husband is of the wife. </p><p><em>And he is the savior of the body. </em>The pronoun HE (<span class="lang el-gr">αὐτός</span>) is supposed by some to refer to <em>Christ; </em>and, by others, to <em>the husband. </em>It applies more naturally, in my opinion, to Christ, but still with a view to the present subject. In this point, as well as in others, the resemblance ought to hold. As Christ rules over his church for her salvation, so nothing yields more advantage or comfort to the wife than to be subject to her husband. To refuse that subjection, by means of which they might be saved, is to choose destruction. </p></div>
