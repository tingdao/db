<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>Unceasingly remembering you</em>. While the adverb <em>unceasingly </em>might be taken in connection with what goes before, it suits better to connect it in this manner. What follows might also be rendered in this way: <em>Remembering your work of faith and labor of love, etc. </em>Nor is it any objection to this that there is an article interposed between the pronoun <span class="lang el-gr">ὑμῶν</span> and the noun <span class="lang el-gr">ἔργου</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(492)</span> for this manner of expression is frequently made use of by Paul. I state this, lest any one should charge the old translator with ignorance, from his rendering it in this manner. <span class="cite-ref">(493)</span> As, however, it matters little as to the main point <span class="cite-ref">(494)</span> which you may choose, I have retained the rendering of Erasmus. <span class="cite-ref">(495)</span></p><p>He assigns a reason, however, why he cherishes so strong an affection towards them, and prays diligently in their behalf — because he perceived in them those gifts of God which should stir him up to cherish towards them love and respect. And, unquestionably, the more that any one excels in piety and other excellences, so much the more ought we to hold him in regard and esteem. For what is more worthy of love than God? Hence there is nothing that should tend more to excite our love to individuals, than when the Lord manifests himself in them by the gifts of his Spirit. This is the highest commendation of all among the pious — this the most sacred bond of connection, by which they are more especially bound to each other. I have said, accordingly, that it is of little importance, whether you render it <em>mindful of your faith</em>, or <em>mindful of you on account of your faith</em>. </p><p><em>Work of faith </em>I understand as meaning the <em>effect </em>of it. This effect, however, may be explained in two ways — <em>passively </em>or <em>actively</em>, either as meaning that faith was in itself a signal token of the power and efficacy of the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as he has wrought powerfully in the exciting of it, or as meaning that it afterwards produced outwardly its fruits. I reckon the effect to be in the root of faith rather than in its fruits — “A rare energy of faith has strewn itself powerfully in you.” </p><p>He adds <em>labor of love</em>, by which he means that in the cultivation of love they had grudged no trouble or labor. And, assuredly, it is known by experience, how laborious love is. That age, however, more especially afforded to believers a manifold sphere of labor, if they were desirous to discharge the offices of love. The Church was marvelously pressed down by a great multitude of afflictions: <span class="cite-ref">(496)</span> many were stripped of their wealth, many were fugitives from their country, many were thrown destitute of counsel, many were tender and weak. <span class="cite-ref">(497)</span> The condition of almost all was involved. So many cases of distress did not allow <em>love </em>to be inactive. </p><p>To <em>hope </em>he assigns <em>patience</em>, as it is always conjoined with it, for <em>what we hope for, we in patience wait for</em>, (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:24</span>) and the statement should be explained to mean, that Paul remembers their patience in hoping for the coming of Christ. From this we may gather a brief definition of true Christianity — that it is a faith that is lively and full of vigor, so that it spares no labor, when assistance is to be given to one’s neighbors, but, on the contrary, all the pious employ themselves diligently in offices of love, and lay out their efforts in them, so that, intent upon the hope of the manifestation of Christ, they despise everything else, and, armed with patience, they rise superior to the wearisomeness of length of time, as well as to all the temptations of the world. </p><p>The clause, <em>before our God and Father</em>, may be viewed as referring to Paul’s remembrance, or to the three things spoken immediately before. I explain it in this way. As he had spoken of his <em>prayers</em>, he declares that as often as he raises his thoughts to the kingdom of God, he, at the same time, recalls to his remembrance the <em>faith, hope</em>, and <em>patience</em>, of the Thessalonians, but as all mere presence must vanish when persons come into the presence of God, this is added, <span class="cite-ref">(498)</span> in order that the affirmation may have more weight. Farther, by this declaration of his goodwill towards them he designed to make them more teachable and prepared to listen. <span class="cite-ref">(499)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(492)</span> The words are <span class="lang el-gr">ὑμῶν τοῦ ἔργου</span>. —<em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(493)</span> The rendering of the Vulgate is as follows: “<em>Sine intermissione memores operis fidei vestrae </em>.” Wiclif (1380) renders as follows: “With outen ceeysynge hauynge mynde of the werk of youre feithe.” Cranmer, (1539,) on the other hand, renders thus: “And call you to remembrance because of the work of your faith—<em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(494)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quant a la substance du propos</span>;” — “As to the substance of the matter.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(495)</span> The rendering of Erasmus is as follows: “Memores vestri propter opus fidei;” — “Mindful of you on account of your work of faith.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(496)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’afflictions quasi sans nombre</span>;” — “By afflictions, as it were, without number.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(497)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Foibles et debiles en la foy</span>;” — “Weak and feeble in faith.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(498)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce poinct a nommeement este adiouste par Sainct Paul</span>;” — “This point has been expressly added by St. Paul.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(499)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car ce n’estoit vne petite consideration pour inciter St. Paul et les autres, a auoir les Thessaloniciens pour recommandez, et en faire esteme</span>;” — “For it was no slight motive to induce St. Paul and others to hold the Thessalonians in estimation, and to regard them with esteem.” </p></div></div>
