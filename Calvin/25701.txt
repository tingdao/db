<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. </em>This is equivalent to saying that he performed more than the law required; just as the Popish monks talk loftily of their works of <em>supererogation, as </em>if they found no great difficulty in fulfilling the law of God. It must be admitted that each of us, according to the measure of the virtues which God has bestowed upon him, is the more strongly bound to thank the Author of them; and that it is an exercise of holy meditation for each of us to ponder on the benefits which he has received, so as not to bury in ingratitude the kindness of God. But there are two things here that must be observed: we must not swell with confidence, as if we had satisfied God; and, next, we must not look down with disdainful contempt upon our brethren. In both respects the Pharisee erred; for, by falsely claiming righteousness for himself, he left nothing to the mercy of God; and, next, he despised all others in comparison of himself. And, indeed, that thanksgiving would not have been disapproved by Christ, if it had not labored under these two defects; <span class="cite-ref">(328)</span> but as the proud hypocrite, by winking at his sins, met the justice of God with a pretense of complete and perfect righteousness, his wicked and detestable hardihood could not but make him fall. For the only hope of the godly, so long as they labor under the weakness of the flesh, is, after acknowledging what is good in them, <span class="cite-ref">(329)</span> to betake themselves to the mercy of God alone, and to rest their salvation on prayer for forgiveness. <span class="cite-ref">(330)</span></p><p>But it may be asked, how did this man, who was blinded by wicked pride, maintain such sanctity of life; for such integrity proceeds only from the Spirit of God, who, we are certain, does not reign in hypocrites? I reply: he trusted only to outward appearance, as if the hidden and inward uncleanness of the heart would not be taken into the account. Though he was full of wicked desires within, yet as he looks only at the appearance, he boldly maintains his innocence. </p><p>Our Lord does not, indeed, accuse him of vanity, in falsely claiming for himself what he does not possess; but it ought to be believed that no man is pure from extortion, injustice, uncleanness, and other vices, unless he is governed by the Spirit of God. </p><p>The word <em>Sabbath </em>( <span class="lang el-gr">σάββατον</span>) denotes in this passage, as in many others, <em>a week </em>But God never enjoined in the Law that his servants should <em>fast every week; </em>so that this <em>fasting </em>and the tithes were voluntary exercises beyond the prescriptions of the Law. <span class="cite-ref">(331)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(328)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si ces deux vices n’y estoyent, qui gastent tout</span>;” — “if those two faults had not been in it, which spoil the whole.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(329)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Apres avoir recognu le bien qui est en eux par la grace de Dieu</span>;” — “after having acknowledged the good that is in them by the grace of God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(330)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et mettre leur salut en la confession de leurs pechez, et remission d’iceux</span>;” — “and to place their salvation in the confession of their sins, and forgiveness of them.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(331)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estoyent des exercises volontaires, et inventez a plaisir</span>;” — “were voluntary exercises, and invented at pleasure.” </p></div></div>
