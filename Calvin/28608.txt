The <em>first </em>is, that as the woman derives her origin from the man, she is therefore inferior in rank. The <em>second </em>is, that as the woman was created for the sake of the man, she is therefore subject to him, as the work ultimately produced is to its cause. <span class="cite-ref">(627)</span> That the man is the beginning of the woman and the end for which she was made, is evident from the law.
