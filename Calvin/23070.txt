<div class="comment-content"><p>Zechariah pursues the same subject as in the preceding chapter: for having promised a joyful and happy state to the faithful, who despising their indulgences in Chaldea had returned to their own country, he now reminds them that their peaceful condition in Judea would not be without many trials and troubles; and therefore he exhorts them to patience, lest they should faint in their adversities, and repent of their return. </p><p>Some apply this chapter to the time of Antichrist, some refer it to the last day, others explain it of the destruction of the city which happened in the reign of Vespasian; but I doubt not but that the Prophet meant here to include the calamities which were near at hand, for the city had not yet been built, <span class="cite-ref">(178)</span> the Jews having been much harassed by their neighbors; and we also know how atrocious was the tyranny which Antiochus exercised: in short, there was a continued series of evils from the time the city and the temple began to be built till the coming of Christ. As then the Jews, who had preferred foreign countries to their own, might have boasted of their lot and despised their brethren, as though they had foolishly and thoughtlessly removed from foreign lands, and had been too precipitate in returning, God designed to declare by the mouth of Zechariah what evils were at hand, that the faithful might with a courageous mind be prepared to undergo their trials, and that they might never succumb under any evils, for the Lord had promised more to them than what they could have attained in Chaldea and other countries. Having now explained the meaning of the Prophet, I shall come to the words. <span class="cite-ref">(179)</span></p><p><em>Behold</em>, he says, <em>the day shall come to Jehovah, and divided shall be thy spoils in the midst </em>of the city. By the demonstrative particle <em>Behold</em>, the certainty of the prophecy, as it has been elsewhere said, is intimated; for the Prophet points out as by the finger what could not yet be comprehended by human minds. And he says, that <em>the day would come to Jehovah</em>, that they might know that they would suffer a just punishment when the Lord treated them in this manner; for men, we know, indulge themselves and seek pleasures, and when God seems not to deal kindly with them, they raise a clamor as though he were too severe. Hence the Prophet reminds them, that so great a calamity would not come without a cause, for God would then execute his judgment. He does not expressly describe it, but he speaks as though he summoned them before God’s tribunal. Now when we understand that we have to do with God, it avails us nothing to murmur. It is then better to be silent when God is set forth as being in the midst of us, for it is certain that he will not in chastising us exceed what is just. </p><p>But here is described a hard affliction; for Zechariah intimates that the city would be exposed to the will of enemies, so that they would divide at pleasure their spoils in the very midst of it. What conquerors snatch away, they afterwards in private divide among themselves; and we know that many cities have been plundered, when yet the conquerors have not dared to expose to view their spoils. But the Prophet means here that there would be no strength in the Jews to prevent their enemies from dividing the spoils at their leisure in the midst of the city. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(178)</span> This was not done till the time of Nehemiah, who returned to Judea about ninety years after the first return under Zerubbabel, and several years, probably thirty or forty, after the date of this prophecy. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(179)</span><em>Dathius </em>truly says, that interpreters have toiled much in the explanation of this chapter, some taking the words in a spiritual sense, others maintaining that what is here said was fulfilled before the coming of Christ, and a third party holding that all is as yet unfulfilled. He was disposed on the whole to assent to the opinion of <em>Grotius</em>, the same in part with that of<em>Calvin </em>— that this prophecy, as well as some in the preceding chapters, were fulfilled in the times of the Maccabees. See <span class="bvs">1Ma_6:26</span>, etc. He indeed admits that this theory does not remove all the difficulties, but leaves less than any other. </p><p><em>Marckius </em>doubted not but that the beginning of this chapter is a prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and he quotes <em>Jerome</em>, <em>Cyril</em>, and <em>Theodoret </em>as having expressed the same opinion. <em>Lowth</em>, <em>Scott</em>, <em>Adam Clarke</em>, and <em>Henderson </em>take the same view. But the sequel of this chapter may be better explained by the events which followed the attacks of the Greco-Syrian kings on Jerusalem, (see <span class="bvs">2Ma_4:0</span>,) than by the events which followed the ruin of that city by the Romans. <em>Blayney </em>viewed the contents of this chapter, and much of what is found in the preceding chapters, as yet unfulfilled: and so does <em>Newcome </em>in part. </p><p><em>Henry </em>is doubtful whether this chapter and the preceding are to be understood of the whole period from the Prophet’s days to the days of the Messiah, or to some events during that time, or to Christ’s coming and the setting up of his kingdom upon the ruins of the Jewish polity. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
