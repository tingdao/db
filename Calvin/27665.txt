<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong>Luke reckoneth up briefly the course of his sailing; and that not only to win credit to the history, that we may know what was done in every place, but that the readers may weigh with themselves the invincible and heroic fortitude which was in Paul, who would rather be tossed and troubled with such long, unlevel,<span class="cite-ref">(452)</span> and troublesome journeys, that he might serve Christ, than provide for his own quietness. Whereas he saith that they were drawn and pulled away, it is not simply referred unto the distance of places; but because the brethren stood on the shore, so long as they could see the ship wherein Paul and his companions were carried. He nameth the havens where the ship arrived,<span class="cite-ref">(453)</span> for this cause that we may know that they sailed quietly without trouble of tempest. Let us search the describers of countries<span class="cite-ref">(454)</span> touching the situation of the cities whereof he maketh mention; it is sufficient for me to show Luke’s purpose.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(452)</span></p><p>“ Ac flexuosis,” and Winding. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(453)</span></p><p>“ Applicuit,” touched, </p><p><span class="cite-note">(454)</span></p><p>“ Consulantur geographi,” geographers may be consulted. </p></div></div>
