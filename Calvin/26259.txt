<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Afterwards, Jesus went. </em>Although John was accustomed to collect those actions and sayings of Christ, which the other three Evangelists had omitted, yet in this passage, contrary to his custom, he repeats the history of a miracle which they had related. But he does so for the express purpose of passing from them to Christ’s sermon, which was delivered next day at Capernaum, because the two things were connected; and therefore this narrative, though the other three Evangelists have it in common with him, has this peculiarity, that it is directed to another object, as we shall see. The other Evangelists (<span class="bvs">Mat_14:13</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_6:32</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_9:10</span>) state that this happened shortly after the death of John the Baptist, by which circumstance of time they point out the cause of Christ’s departure; for when tyrants have once imbrued their hands in the blood of the godly, they kindle into greater cruelty, in the same manner as intemperate drinking aggravates the thirst of drunkards. Christ therefore intended to abate the rage of Herod by his absence. He uses the term,<em>Sea of Galilee</em>, as meaning the lake of Gennesareth. When he adds that it was called the <em>Sea of Tiberias</em>, he explains more fully the place to which Christ withdrew; for the whole lake did not bear that name, but only that part of it which lay contiguous to the bank on which <em>Tiberias </em>was situated. </p></div>
