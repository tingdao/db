<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>Arise, O Lord. </em>As in the former verses David boasted of his quiet state, it would now appear he desires of the Lord to be preserved in safety during the whole of his life; as if he had said, Lord, since thou hast overthrown my enemies, grant that this thy goodness may follow me, and be continued even to the end of my course. But because it is no uncommon thing for David, in the Psalms, to mingle together various affections, it seems more probable, that, after having made mention of his confidence in God, he returns again to make the same prayers as at the beginning. <span class="cite-ref">(45)</span> He therefore asks to be preserved, because he was in eminent peril. What follows concerning <em>the smiting of </em>his enemies, may be explained in two ways: either that in praying he calls to his remembrance his former victories, or that having experienced the assistance of God, and obtained the answer of his prayers, he now follows it up by thanksgiving: and this last meanings I am much inclined to adopt. In the first place, then, he declares that he fled to God for help in dangers, and humbly prayed for deliverance, and after salvation had been granted him, he gives thanks, by which he testifies, that he acknowledged God to be the author of the deliverance which he had obtained. <span class="cite-ref">(46)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(45)</span><span class="lang fr-fr">A faire les mesmes prieres qu’au commencement</span>. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(46)</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Et puis a cause qu’il a obtenu cela, c’est a dire, qu’il est demeure, en sauvete, it luy en rend graces; tesmoignant par cela qu’il tient de Dieu sa deliverance et la recognoist de luy</span>. — <em>Fr</em>. And then having obtained this, that is to say, having been preserved in safety, he gives thanks to God, testifying by this, that he owed his deliverance to him, and recognized it as coming from him. </p></div></div>
