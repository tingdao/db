<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Now if any man build upon this foundation </em>He pursues still farther the metaphor. It would not have been enough to have laid the foundation if the entire superstructure did not correspond; for as it were an absurd thing to raise a structure of vile materials on a foundation of gold, so it were greatly criminal to bury Christ under a mass of strange doctrines. <span class="cite-ref">(177)</span> By<em>gold</em>, then, and <em>silver</em>, and <em>precious stones</em>, he means doctrine worthy of Christ, and of such a nature as to be a superstructure corresponding to such a foundation. Let us not imagine, however, that this doctrine is apart from Christ, but on the contrary let us understand that we must continue to preach Christ until the very completion of the building. Only we must observe order, so as to begin with general doctrine, and more essential articles, as the foundations, and then go on to admonitions, exhortations, and everything that is requisite for perseverance, confirmation, and advancement. </p><p>As there is an agreement thus far as to Paul’s meaning, without any controversy, it follows on the other hand, that by <em>wood, stubble </em>and <em>hay</em>, is meant doctrine not answering to the foundation, such as is forged in men’s brain, and is thrust in upon us as though it were the oracles of God. <span class="cite-ref">(178)</span> For God will have his Church trained up by the pure preaching of his own word, not by the contrivances of men, of which sort also is that which has no tendency to edification, as for example curious <em>questions</em>, (<span class="bvs">Tit_1:4</span>,) which commonly contribute more to ostentation, or some foolish appetite, than to the salvation of men. </p><p>He forewarns them that <em>every man’s work </em>will one day <em>be made manifest of what sort it is</em>, however it may be for a time concealed, as though he had said: “It may indeed happen, that unprincipled workmen may for a time deceive, so that the world does not perceive how far each one has labored faithfully or fraudulently, but what is now as it were buried in darkness must of necessity come to light, and what is now glorious in the eyes of men, must before the face of God fall down, and be regarded as worthless.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(177)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce seroit vne chose mal seante que Christ lust suffoque en mettant et meslant auec luy quelques doctrines estranges</span>;” — “It were an unseemly thing that Christ should be choked by placing upon him and mixing up with him some strange doctrines.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(178)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">On vent a force faire receuoir pour oracles et reuelations procedees de Dieu</span>;” — “They would force us to receive it as if it were oracles and revelations that have come forth from God.” </p></div></div>
