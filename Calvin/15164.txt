The miracle adverted to is the last which was there wrought, when God, by the powerful hand of his angel, slew, in one night, all the first-born of Egypt. According to a common and familiar mode of speaking in the Hebrew language, the first-born are called <em>the beginning, </em>or <em>the first-fruits of strength. </em>Although the old advance to death as they decline in years, yet as they are in a manner renewed in their offspring, and thus may be said to recover their decayed strength, the term <em>strength </em>is applied to their children. And the first-born are called <em>the beginning </em>or <em>the first-fruits </em>of this strength, as I have explained more at large on <span class="bvs">Gen_49:3</span>. The houses of Egypt are called <em>the tents of Ham, </em>because Misraim, who gave the name to the country, was the son of Ham, <span class="bvs">Gen_10:6</span>. Farther, there is here celebrated the free love of God towards the posterity of Shem, as manifested in his preferring them to all the children of Ham, although they were possessed of no intrinsic excellence which might render them worthy of such a distinction. </p><p><strong>(352)</strong> “<em>He levelled a path to his anger </em><span class="lang he-il">פלס</span> [the word for <em>levelled </em>] signifies to direct by a line or level; and when applied to a way, is understood to denote that the way is made straight and smooth, so as to leave no impediment to the passenger. See Poole’s Synopsis and Le Clerc. The sense will be much the same whether we thus interpret the phrase, or suppose the anger of God to have taken its direction, <span class="lang el-gr">παρὰ στάθμην</span>, in a straight line, and by a level; that is, in the shortest way, without delay or deviation.” — <em>Merrick </em>’<em>s Annotations </em></p></div>
