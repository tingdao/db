<div class="comment-content"><p>He confirms the former verse, that when Babylon was destroyed, there would be no hope of restoration. It often happens, that those cities which have been wholly destroyed are afterwards built up again; but God says that this would not be the case with Babylon, for it was given over to perpetual destruction. By <em>corner </em>and <em>foundations </em>he understands the strength of the buildings, he then says, that there was no hope that the stones would be again fitted together, for the building of the city, for Babylon would become a perpetual waste or desolation. </p><p>We have, indeed, said, that the walls of Babylon were not made of stones but of bricks: but the Prophet simply speaks according to the common manner, in order to show that its ruin would be for ever. <span class="cite-ref">(89)</span> We have also said elsewhere that a difference is commonly made by the prophets between the people of God and the reprobate, that God promises to his Church a new state as a resurrection from death, but that he denounces on the unbelieving perpetual desolation. This course is now followed by our Prophet when he says, that the desolations there would <em>be for ever, </em>because there is no hope of pardon or of mercy to the unbelieving. It afterwards follows, — </p><p><strong>(89)</strong> Though the reatest part of the walls and towers was built of bricks, yet there were stones no doubt used. Some understand, by “stone,” a king or prince, and consider that an intimation is given that Babylon would not hereafter have a king or its own, but be tributary. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
