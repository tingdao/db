<div class="comment-content"><p>And hence he adds, <em>Where are your gods? </em>Here God laughs to scorn the false confidence by which the Jews deceived themselves: <em>Where are your gods, which you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, let us see whether they will help you in the time of your distress. </em>We now understand what the Prophet means: for he shews that the people acted in a most strange manner; for they worshipped idols when they were in safety, and afterwards would have God to be bound to them; and yet they denied the true God when they fell away unto idols. He then shews that they could expect no aid from God; for they robbed him of his own power when they devised idols for themselves. But we must ever remember what he said, that false gods were counted as fathers and authors of salvation by the people. </p><p>The same thing is, no doubt, done at this day under the Papacy; for the Papists have their patrons; and when they find that their foolish superstitions can do nothing for them, they would have God to help them, and yet they leave nothing to him: after having taken away all his glory, and divided it as a spoil among dead saints, they would then have God to be their helper. But we see what God’s answer to them is, “Where are your gods?” etc. </p><p>Now this truth is of use to us; and we hence learn, that we are not to wait until we are really, and in the last state of despair, compelled to acknowledge that our labors have been useless, while we hoped and prayed for help from idols; but that we ought to come directly to God himself for aid in our distress. </p><p>God proceeds farther with the sarcasm or the derision which he has employed, <em>Where are thy gods? Let them now arise that they may help thee; </em>that is, — let them try their utmost whether they can aid thee. <em>According to the number of thy cities have been thy gods, O Judah </em>As the people were not satisfied with one God, every city chose a patron for itself. “Since, then, innumerable gods are invoked by you, how comes it that they do not help you?” We hence see that the unbelief of the people is here sharply reproved; for they did not acquiesce in God alone, but sought to procure for themselves gods without number: there were many cities in the tribe of Judah, and there were as many patrons. The one true God would have been fully sufficient for them, and would have brought them complete deliverance whenever needed; but the one true God they despised, and every city devised a god for itself. “Since ye trust,” he says, “in such a multitude, <em>let them now arise, that they may succor you; </em>for I, who am one, am despised by you.” We now understand what the Prophet means also in this part.
