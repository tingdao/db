<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Strong bulls have encompassed me. </em>The Psalmist now complains of the cruelty and barbarous rage of his enemies; and he compares them first to bulls, secondly to lions, and thirdly to dogs. When the anger of bulls is kindled, we know how fierce and terrible they are. The lion, also, is a cruel beast, and dreadful to mankind. And the eager and fierce boldness with which dogs, when once they are irritated, rush upon a man to do him injury, is well known. In short, David’s enemies were so blood-thirsty and cruel, that they more resembled wild beasts than men. He calls them not simply <em>bulls, </em>but <em>strong bulls. </em>Instead of rendering the original word <span class="lang he-il">רבים</span>, <em>rabbim, strong, </em>as we have done, some would render it <em>many: </em>with which I cannot agree. David, it is true, was assailed by great hosts of enemies; but it appears, from the second clause of the verse, that what is here described is their strength, and not their number. He there terms them <em>the bulls of Bashan; </em>meaning by that expression, well-fed bulls, and, consequently, large and strong: for we know that the hill of Bashan was distinguished for rich and fat pastures. <span class="cite-ref">(511)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(511)</span> “The bull is known to be a fierce animal, and those of Bashan, from its luxuriant pastures, were uncommonly so.” —<em>Dr Geddes. </em></p></div></div>
