<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Allow the dead to bury their dead. </em>By these words Christ does not condemn burial: for it would have been shameful and cruel to throw away the bodies of the dead unburied, and we know that the custom of burying originated in a divine command, and was practiced by the saints, in order to strengthen the hope of the last resurrection. He intended only to show, that what ever withdraws us from the right course, or retards us in it, deserves no other name than <em>death </em>Those only live, he tells us, who devote all their thoughts, and every part of their life, to obedience to God; while those who do not rise above the world, — who devote themselves to pleasing men, and forget God, — are like <em>dead men, </em>who are idly and uselessly employed in taking care of the dead. </p></div>
