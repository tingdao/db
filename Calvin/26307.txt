<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>49.</strong><em>Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and are dead. </em>He says that the <em>manna </em>was a perishing food to <em>their fathers, </em>for it did not free them from death. It follows, therefore, that souls do not find anywhere else than in him that food by which they are fed to spiritual life. Besides, we must keep in remembrance what I formerly stated, that what is here said does not relate to the <em>manna, </em>so far as it was a secret figure of Christ; for in that respect Paul calls it <em>spiritual food</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Co_10:3</span>.) But we have said that Christ here accommodates his discourse to the hearers, who, caring only about feeding the belly, looked for nothing higher in the <em>manna. </em>Justly, therefore does he declare that <em>their fathers are dead, </em>that is, those who in the same manner, were devoted to the belly, or, in other words, who thought of nothing higher than this world. <span class="cite-ref">(155)</span> And yet he invites them to <em>eat, </em>when he says that he has come, <em>that any man may eat; </em>for this mode of expression has the same meaning as if he said, that he is ready to give himself to all, provided that they are only willing to believe. That not one of those who have once eaten Christ <em>shall die </em>— must be understood to mean, that the life which he bestows on us is never extinguished, as we stated under the Fifth Chapter. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(155)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, ne pensoyent plus haut que ce monde</span>.” </p></div></div>
