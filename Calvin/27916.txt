<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And after three days. </em>Paul’s humanity<span class="cite-ref">(673)</span> was wonderful, in that, though he had suffered such cruel injuries of his nation, he studied, notwithstanding, to appease the Jews which are at Rome, and he excuseth himself to them, lest they hate his cause, because they hear that the priests do hate him. He might well have excused himself before men, if he passed over these Jews and turned himself to the Gentiles. For though he had continually, in divers places, essayed to bring them to Christ, yet they were more and more nettled and moved;<span class="cite-ref">(674)</span> and yet he had omitted nothing, neither in Asia, nor in Greece, neither at Jerusalem, which might mitigate their fury. Therefore, all men would have justly pardoned him, if he had let those alone whom he had so often tried [experienced] to be of desperate pride.<span class="cite-ref">(675)</span> But because he knew that his Master was given of his Father to be the minister of the Jews, to fulfill the promises whereby God had adopted to himself the seed of Abraham to be his people; he looketh unto the calling of God, and is never weary. He saw that he must remain at Rome, seeing he had liberty granted to teach, he would not that they should be deprived of the fruit of his labor. Secondly, he would not have them moved through hatred of his cause to trouble the Church; because a small occasion might have caused great destruction. Therefore, Paul meant to beware, lest, according to their wonted madness, they should set all on fire.<span class="cite-ref">(676)</span></p><p><em>I have done nothing against the people. </em>These two things might have made the Jews hate him; either because he should have done hurt to the commonwealth of his nation, as some runagates did increase their bondage, which was too cruel, through their treachery; or because he should have done somewhat against the worship of God; for though the Jews were grown out of kind,<span class="cite-ref">(677)</span> and religion was depraved and corrupted among them with many errors, yet the very name of the law and the worship of the temple were greatly reverenced. Furthermore, Paul denieth not but that he did freely omit those ceremonies whereto the Jews were superstitiously tied; yet he cleareth himself of the crime of revolting whereof he might be suspected. Therefore, understand those ordinances of the fathers, whereby the children of Abraham, and the disciples of Moses ought, according to their faith, to have been distinguished from the rest of the Gentiles. And surely in that he did cleave so holily to Christ, who is the soul and perfection of the law, he is so far from impairing the ordinances of the fathers, that none did better observe the same.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(673)</span></p><p>“ Mausuetudo,” meekness. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(674)</span></p><p>“ Exacerbati,” exasperated. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(675)</span></p><p>“ Pervicaciae,” obstinacy and petulance. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(676)</span></p><p>“ Pessimi incendii faces essent,” they should be torches to kindle a very bad fire. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(677)</span></p><p>“ Degeneres,” degenerate. </p></div></div>
