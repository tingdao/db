<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>So Joshua took all that land, </em>etc In the uninterrupted series of victories, when the land, of its own accord, spewed out its old inhabitants, to give free possession to the Israelites, it was visibly manifest, as is said in the Psalm, (<span class="bvs">Psa_44:3</span>) </p><p>“They got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou had a favor unto them.” </p><p>The design of enumerating the places and districts is to let us know that the work which God had begun he continued to carry on without interruption. But it is a mistake to suppose: as some do, that by the name Israel a certain mountain is meant. For it will be plain, from the end of the chapter, (<span class="bvs">Jos_11:21</span>) that the term is applied indiscriminately to the mountainous part of Israel and Judah. There is therefore an enlarge in the enumeration, because the mountains of the ten tribes are tacitly compared with the mountains of Judah. Accordingly, an antithesis is to be understood. In the other mountain (<span class="bvs">Jos_11:17</span>) the surname is ambiguous. Some understand it to mean <em>division, </em>as if it had been cut in two; <span class="cite-ref">(115)</span> others to mean <em>smooth, </em>as it was destitute of trees, just as a head is rendered smooth by baldness. As the point is uncertain, and of little importance, the reader is at liberty to make his choice. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(115)</span> Latin, “Dissectus.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Couppee ou fendue</span>;” “Cut, or cleft.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
