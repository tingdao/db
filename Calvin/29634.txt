<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13</strong><em>With love. </em>Others render it <em>by love; </em>for Paul says <em>in love</em>, which, according to the Hebrew idiom, is equivalent to <em>by </em>or <em>with</em>. I prefer, however, to explain it thus — as meaning that he exhorts them not merely to respect them, <span class="cite-ref">(605)</span> but also love them. For as the doctrine of the gospel is lovely, so it is befitting that the ministers of it should be loved. It were, however, rather stiff to speak of <em>having in esteem by love</em>, while the connecting together of love with honor suits well. </p><p><em>Be at peace</em>. While this passage has various readings, even among the Greeks, I approve rather of the rendering which has been given by the old translator, and is followed by Erasmus — <em>Pacem habete cum eis, vel colite </em> — (<em>Have </em>or <em>cultivate peace with them</em>.) <span class="cite-ref">(606)</span> For Paul, in my opinion, had in view to oppose the artifices of Satan, who ceases not to use every endeavor to stir up either quarrels, or disagreements, or enmities, between people and pastor. Hence we see daily how pastors are hated by their Churches for some trivial reason, or for no reason whatever, because this desire for the cultivation of peace, which Paul recommends so strongly, is not exercised as it ought. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(605)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De porter honneur aux fideles ministres</span>;” — “To do honor to faithful ministers.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(606)</span> Wiclif (1380) renders as follows: “Haue ye pees with hem.” </p></div></div>
