<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Out of that land went forth Asshur</em>. It is credible that Asshur was one of the posterity of Shem. And the opinion has been commonly received, that he is here mentioned, because, when he was dwelling, in the neighborhood of Nimrod, he was violently expelled thence. In this manner, Moses would mark the barbarous ferocity of Nimrod. And truly these are the accustomed fruits of a greatness which does not keep within bounds; whence has arisen the old proverb, ‘Great kingdoms are great robberies.’ It is indeed necessary that some should preside over others; but where ambition, and the desire of rising higher than is right, are rampant, they not only draw with them the greatest and most numerous injuries, but also verge closely upon the dissolution of human society. Yet I rather adopt the opinion of those who say that Asshur is not, in this place, the name of a man, but of a country which derived its appellation from him; and thus the sense will be, that Nimrod, not content with his large and opulent kingdom, gave the reins to his cupidity, and pushed the boundaries of his empire even into Assyria, where he also built new cities. <span class="cite-ref">(318)</span> The passage in Isaiah (<span class="bvs">Isa_23:13</span>) is alone opposed to this opinion, where he says, ‘Behold the land of the Chaldeans, the people was not, Asshur founded it when they inhabited the deserts, and he reduced it to ruin.’ <span class="cite-ref">(319)</span> For the prophet seems to say, that cities were built by the Assyrians in Chaldea, whereas previously, its inhabitants were wandering and scattered as in a desert. But it may be, that the prophet speaks of other changes of these kingdoms, which occurred afterwards. For, at the time in which the Assyrians maintained the sovereignty, seeing that they flourished in unbounded wealth, it is credible that Chaldea, which they had subjected to themselves was so adorned and increased by a long peace, that it might seem to have been founded by them. And we know, that when the Chaldeans, in their turn, seized on the empire, Babylon was exalted on the ruins of Nineveh. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(318)</span> See the marginal reading of the English version — ‘He went out into Assyria.’ </p><p><span class="cite-note">(319)</span> Bishop Lowth’s translation of the passage is as follows: — </p><p>“Behold the land of the Chaldeans; <LineBreak />This people was of no account; <LineBreak />(The Assyrian founded it for the inhabitants of the desert; <LineBreak />They raised the watch-towers, they set up the palaces thereof;) <LineBreak />This people hath reduced her to ruin.” </p><p>See also his note on this passage, which accords with Calvin’s supposition, that the prophet referred to some subsequent period of history. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
