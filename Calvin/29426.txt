<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Circumcised on the eighth day </em>It is literally— “The <em>circumcision of the eighth day.” </em>There is no difference, however, in the sense, for the meaning is, that he was circumcised in the proper manner, and according to the appointment of the law <span class="cite-ref">(173)</span>. Now this customary circumcision was reckoned of superior value; and, besides, it was a token of the race to which he belonged; on which he touches immediately afterwards. For the case was not the same as to foreigners, for after they had become <em>proselytes </em>they were circumcised in youth, or when grown up to manhood, and sometimes even in old age. He says, accordingly, that he is of the <em>race of Israel </em>He names the tribe <span class="cite-ref">(174)</span>, — not, in my opinion, on the ground that the <em>tribe of Benjamin </em>had a superiorityof excellence above others, but for shewing more fully that he belonged to the race of Israel, as it was the custom that every one was numbered according to his particular tribe. With the same view he adds still farther, that he is an <em>Hebrew of the Hebrews </em>For this name was the most ancient, as being that by which Abraham himself is designated by Moses. (<span class="bvs">Gen_14:13</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(175)</span> The sum, therefore, is this — that Paul was descended from the seed of Jacob from the most ancient date, so that he could reckon up grandfathers and great-grandfathers, and could even go still farther back. </p><p><em>According to the law, a Pharisee </em>Having spoken of the nobility of his descent, he now proceeds to speak of special endowments of persons, as they are called. It is very generally known, that the sect of the Pharisees was celebrated above the others for the renown in which it was held for sanctity and for doctrine. He states, that he belonged to that sect. The common opinion is, that the Pharisees were so called from a term signifying <em>separation </em><span class="cite-ref">(176)</span><em>; </em>but I approve rather of what I learned at one time from Capito, a man of sacred memory <span class="cite-ref">(177)</span>, that it was because they boasted that they were endowed with the gift of <em>interpreting </em>Scripture, for <span class="lang he-il">פרש</span><em>(parash,) </em>among the Hebrews, conveys the idea of <em>interpretation. </em><span class="cite-ref">(178)</span> While others declared themselves to be <em>literals </em><span class="cite-ref">(179)</span><em>, </em>they preferred to be regarded as <em>Pharisees </em><span class="cite-ref">(180)</span><em>, </em>as being in possession of the interpretations of the ancients. And assuredly it is manifest that, under the pretext of antiquity, they corrupted the whole of Scripture by their inventions; but as they, at the same time, retained some sound interpretations, handed down by the ancients, they were held in the highest esteem. </p><p>But what is meant by the clause, <em>according to the law? </em>For unquestionably nothing is more opposed to the law of God than sects, for in it is communicated the truth of God, which is the bond of unity. Besides this, Josephus tells us in the 13th book of his Antiquities, that all the sects took their rise during the high priesthood of Jonathan. Paul employs the term <em>law, </em>not in its strict sense, to denote the doctrine of religion, however much corrupted it was at that time, as Christianity is at this day in the Papacy. As, however, there <em>were </em>many that were in the rank of teachers, who were less skillful, and exercised <span class="cite-ref">(181)</span> he makes mention also of his <em>zeal. </em>It was, indeed, a very heinous sin on the part of Paul to <em>persecute the Church, </em>but as he had to dispute with unprincipled persons, who, by mixing up Christ with Moses, <em>pretended </em>zeal for the law, he mentions, on the other hand, that he was so keen a zealot of the law, that on that ground <em>he persecuted the Church </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(173)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Circoncis deuement et selon l’ordonnance </span><em class="lang fr-fr">et </em><span class="lang fr-fr">les obseruations de la loy</span>;” — “Circumcised duly and according to the appointment and the observances of the law.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(174)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il note la tribu et le chef de la lignee de laquelle il estoit descendu</span>;” — “He names the tribe and the head of the line from which he was descended.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(175)</span> See Calvin <em>on the Corinthians, </em>vol. 2, p. 357, 358. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(176)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que les Pharisiens ont este ainsi nommez, pource qu’ils estoyent separez d’auec les autres, comme estans saincts</span>;” — “That the Pharisees were so called, because they were separated from others, as being holy.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(177)</span> See Calvin On <em>the Corinthians, </em>vol. 2, p. 82. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(178)</span> The reader will find the etymology of the term <em>Pharisees, </em>discussed at considerable length in the <em>Harmony, </em>vol. 1, p. 281, n. 4. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(179)</span> The meaning is, that in interpreting Scripture, they did not go beyond the bare letter.— Ed. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(180)</span> See <em>Harmony, </em>vol. 1, pp. 281, 282, and vol. 3, p. 74. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(181)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Exercez en l’Ecriture</span>;” — “Exercised in Scripture.” </p></div></div>
