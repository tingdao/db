<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Judah begat Pharez and Zarah by Tamar </em>This was a prelude to that emptying of himself, <span class="cite-ref">(89)</span> of which Paul speaks, (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>). The Son of God might have kept his descent unspotted and pure from every reproach or mark of infamy. But he came into the world to </p><p>“empty himself, and take upon him the form of a servant,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>) </p><p>to be </p><p>“a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_22:6</span>) </p><p>and at length to undergo the accursed death of the cross. He therefore did not refuse to admit a stain into his genealogy, arising from incestuous intercourse which took place among his ancestors. Though Tamar was not impelled by lust to seek connection with her father-in-law, yet it was in an unlawful manner that she attempted to revenge the injury which she had received. Judah again intended to commit fornication, and unknowingly to himself, met with his daughter-in-law. <span class="cite-ref">(90)</span> But the astonishing goodness of God strove with the sin of both; so that, nevertheless, this adulterous seed came to possess the scepter. <span class="cite-ref">(91)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(89)</span><span class="lang el-gr">᾿Αλλ ᾿ ἑαυτὸν ἐχένωσε, </span> — but he emptied himself. Such is the literal import of the words which are rendered in the English version, <em>But made himself of no reputation. </em>—<em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(90)</span> “In nurum suam incidit.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Judas a commis sa meschancete avec sa bru, pensant que ce fust une autre</span>.” — “Judah committed his wickedness with his daughter-in-law, supposing her to be a different person” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(91)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin que neantmoins ceste semence bastarde vint a avoir un jour en main le scepter Royal</span>.” — “So that nevertheless this bastard seed came to have one day in its hand the Royal scepter.” </p></div></div>
