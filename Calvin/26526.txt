<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Lo, he whom thou lovest is sick. </em>The message is short, but Christ might easily learn from it what the two sisters wished; for, under this complaint, they modestly state their request that he would be pleased to grant them relief. We are not forbidden, indeed, to use a longer form of prayer; but our principal object ought to be, to pour into the bosom of God all our cares, and every thing that distresses us, that he may afford deliverance. Such is the manner in which the women act towards Christ: they plainly tell him their distress, in consequence of which they expect some alleviation. We ought also to observe that, from Christâ€™s <em>love, </em>they are led to entertain a confident hope of obtaining assistance, <em>he whom thou lovest; </em>and this is the invariable rule of praying aright; for, where the <em>love </em>of God is, there deliverance is certain and at hand, because God cannot forsake him <em>whom he loveth </em></p></div>
