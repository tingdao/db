<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Save me, O God! for the waters, etc. </em>Under the figure of <em>waters, </em>the Psalmist represents his condition as so extremely distressing that it brought him even to the brink of despair; and yet we know that, so far from being a soft and an effeminate person, he was one who encountered and overcame dreadful temptations with extraordinary courage. Whence we may infer the bitterness of the distress with which he was at that time afflicted. Some understand the word <em>soul </em>as denoting <em>life; </em><span class="cite-ref">(68)</span> but this gives a very cold and unsatisfactory meaning. It rather signifies <em>the heart. </em>A man when he falls into an abyss of waters, may prevent for some time the water from entering his body, by stopping his mouth and his nostrils, but at length, from its being impossible for a human being to live without respiration, suffocation will compel him to let in the waters, and they will penetrate even to the heart. David by this metaphor would intimate, not only that the waters had covered and overwhelmed him, but also that he had been forced to draw them into his body. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(68)</span> “<em>The waters are come in unto my soul</em>; <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , a flood of overwhelming calamities threaten my life: comp. verse 16.” —<em>Cresswell</em>. Williams thinks the allusion is to a leaky vessel, or to an inundation. </p></div></div>
