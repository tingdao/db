<div class="comment-content"><p>He afterwards says, <em>Behold, I will bring a renewal and a healing, and I will heal them </em>This is the main point, as they say, in the passage. He had been hitherto shewing, that the Jews had deserved so heavy a punishment, because by their obstinacy they had not ceased to provoke God against themselves. But he promises here to be propitious to them after having moderately corrected them. For we have said, that the design of this prophecy was to sustain the Jews, so that they might not despond, but rely on the promise of favor, however bitter exile might be. Then he says, <em>I will bring a renewal, </em>or restoration, <em>and a healing </em><span class="cite-ref">(88)</span></p><p>And it is added, <em>I will open to them abundance of peace and of truth </em>Some render the last word, <span class="lang he-il">אמת</span>, <em>amet, </em>prayer; for the verb <span class="lang he-il">אמן</span><em>amen, </em>means sometimes to pray and also to multiply. There may then be a twofold meaning; the first, that God would open to them an access to prayer; for things were so hopeless among the people, that no one dared to utter a word. Even Jeremiah himself was forbidden to pray, (<span class="bvs">Jer_11:14</span>) because God had resolved to destroy those miserable men respecting whom there was no hope of repentance. Some therefore understand that an access to prayer is here promised, so that the faithful and the servants of God might pray for the prosperity of the city. But this explanation seems to me to be too far-fetched. I take, therefore, a simpler interpretation, — that God would give them abundance of peace, or rather the prolonging or continuance of peace. By peace is meant, as it is well known, a happy state. Then to Jerusalem, reduced to extreme miseries, God promises joyful things, so that she should afterwards live prosperously; and he adds the word <em>truth, </em>which is to be taken here for stability, <span class="cite-ref">(89)</span> as, indeed, everywhere in Scripture, as though he had said, that the prosperous state of the city would notbe for a month, or a short time, but continual and even perpetual, as he declares in the next verse. </p><p><strong>(88)</strong> The word rendered <em>“renewal,” </em>means lengthening, that is, of man’s life; hence it is taken in the sense of recovery, — “I will bring to it a recovery and a healing.” See <span class="bvs">Jer_8:22</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(89)</strong> The best word for it here, as given by the <em>Syr., </em>is <em>security; </em>“And I will unfold to them abundance of peace and security.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
