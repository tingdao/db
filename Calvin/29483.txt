<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>The head of the body. </em>Having discoursed in a general way of Christ’s excellence, and of his sovereign dominion over all creatures, he again returns to those things which relate peculiarly to the Church. Under the term <em>head </em>some consider many things to be included. And, unquestionably, he makes use afterwards, as we shall find, of the same metaphor in this sense — that as in the human body it serves as a root, from which vital energy is diffused through all the members, so the life of the Church flows out from Christ, etc. (<span class="bvs">Col_2:19</span>.) Here, however, in my opinion, he speaks chiefly of government. He shews, therefore, that it is Christ that alone has authority to govern the Church, that it is he to whom alone believers ought to have an eye, and on whom alone the unity of the body depends. </p><p>Papists, with the view of supporting the tyranny of their idol, allege that the Church would be (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀκέφαλον</span>) <em>without a head</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(309)</span> if the Pope did not, as a head, exercise rule in it. Paul, however, does not allow this honor even to angels, and yet he does not maim the Church, by depriving her of her head; for as Christ claims for himself this title, so he truly exercises the office. I am also well aware of the cavil by which they attempt to escape — that the Pope is a ministerial head. The name, however, of <em>head </em>is too august to be rightfully transferred to any mortal man, <span class="cite-ref">(310)</span> under any pretext, especially without the command of Christ. Gregory shews greater modesty, who says (in his 92<span class="cite-ref">nd</span> Epistle, 4<span class="cite-ref">th</span> Book) that Peter was indeed one of the chief members of the Church, but that he and the other Apostles were members under one head. </p><p><em>He is the beginning. </em>As <span class="lang el-gr">ἀρχὴ</span> is sometimes made use of among the Greeks to denote the end, to which all things bear a relation, we might understand it as meaning, that Christ is in this sense (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀρχὴ</span>) <em>the end</em>. I prefer, however, to explain Paul’s words thus — that he is the <em>beginning</em>, because he is the <em>first-born from the dead</em>; for in the resurrection there is a restoration of all things, and in this manner the commencement of the second and new creation, for the former had fallen to pieces in the ruin of the first man. As, then, Christ in rising again had made a commencement of the kingdom of God, he is on good grounds called the <em>beginning</em>; for <em>then </em>do we truly begin to have a being in the sight of God, when we are renewed, so as to be new creatures. He is called the <em>first-begotten from the dead</em>, not merely because he was the first that rose again, but because he has also restored life to others, as he is elsewhere called the <em>first-fruits of those that rise again</em>. (<span class="bvs">1Co_15:20</span>.) </p><p><em>That he may in all things</em>. From this he concludes, that supremacy belongs to him in all things. For if he is the Author and Restorer of all things, it is manifest that this honor is justly due to him. At the same time the phrase <em>in omnibus </em> (<em>in all things</em>) may be taken in two ways — either <em>over all creatures</em>, or, <em>in everything</em>. This, however, is of no great importance, for the simple meaning is, that all things are subjected to his sway. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(309)</span> See Institutes, vol. 2, p. 11. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(310)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Est si honorable et magnifique qu’il ne pent estre transferé a homme mortel</span>;” — “Is so honorable and magnificent, that it cannot be transferred to a mortal man.” </p></div></div>
