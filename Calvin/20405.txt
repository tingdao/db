<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here makes a distinction between his weeping and that blind sorrow by which the unbelieving are affected and violently agitated: they have no regard to God. Then the Prophet says here that he not only wept, but that he also prayed and waited for God to put an end to evils. As I have already said, the unbelieving grieve abundantly in adversities, nay, they abandon themselves to sorrow; but they turn away wholly from God, and are like wild beasts. Then the Prophet points out the right way to mourn: our eyes must flow down to weariness and without rest, but at the same time we must wait until God be propitious to us. Therefore this verse connects well with the former, <span class="cite-ref">(199)</span><em>until Jehovah look down and see from heaven; </em>for otherwise tears would draw us to despair, and despair would become the cause of fury; for we see that the ungodly murmur against God. </p><p>Thus, then, ought we to weep, in order that we may at the same time cherish hope while we wait for God to look down on us and to see our miseries from heaven. The word <em>heaven</em>, is not added uselessly, because men in their evils, when they seek God, are filled with terror, for they do not think that they can ascend to him: hence, then, it is, that they despond, for they imagine that God is too remote from them. The Prophet therefore anticipates here this false notion, and says that we ought nevertheless to wait until God looks down from heaven; which corresponds with what is said in the Psalms: that God is high and yet has respect to low things. (<span class="bvs">Psa_113:4</span>.) Though, then, the majesty of God is elevated above all the heavens, yet this does not prevent him familiarly to regard what is low and despised in the world. At length it follows, — </p><p><strong>(199)</strong> The connection of this verse with the preceding will be more evident from the following version, — </p><p>  </p><p><strong>49.</strong>Mine eye hath poured down, and it will not cease, <LineBreak />With any intermissions, </p><p><strong>50.</strong>Until Jehovah look down <LineBreak />And see from heaven. </p><p>To “see” here, as in <span class="bvs">Lam_3:36</span>, means to regard, so as to interfere in the affairs of men. “with any,” etc., literally, “With no,” etc. But the English language not admit of the two negatives, though the Welsh will. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
