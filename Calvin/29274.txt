<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>With all humility</em>. He now descends to particulars, and first of all he mentions <em>humility </em>The reason is, that he was about to enter on the subject of Unity, to which humility is the first step. This again produces <em>meekness, </em>which disposes us to bear with our brethren, and thus to preserve that unity which would otherwise be broken a hundred times in a day. Let us remember, therefore, that, in cultivating brotherly kindness, we must begin with humility. Whence come rudeness, pride, and disdainful language towards brethren? Whence come quarrels, insults, and reproaches? Come they not from this, that every one carries his love of himself, and his regard to his own interests, to excess? By laying aside haughtiness and a desire of pleasing ourselves, we shall become meek and gentle, and acquire that moderation of temper which will overlook and forgive many things in the conduct of our brethren. Let us carefully observe the order and arrangement of these exhortations. It will be to no purpose that we inculcate forbearance till the natural fierceness has been subdued, and mildness acquired; and it will be equally vain to discourse of <em>meekness, </em>till we have begun with <em>humility. </em></p><p><em>Forbearing one another in love. </em>This agrees with what is elsewhere taught, that “love suffereth long and is kind.” (<span class="bvs">1Co_13:4</span>.) Where love is strong and prevalent, we shall perform many acts of mutual forbearance. </p></div>
