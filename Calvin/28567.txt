<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>But I keep under my body </em><span class="cite-ref">(516)</span> Budaeus reads <em>Observo </em>; (<em>I keep a watch over</em>;) but in my opinion the Apostle has employed the word <span class="lang el-gr">ὑπωπιάζειν</span><span class="cite-ref">(517)</span> here, to mean <em>treating in a servile manner </em><span class="cite-ref">(518)</span> For he declares that he does not indulge self, but restrains his inclinations — which cannot be accomplished unless the body is tamed, and, by being held back from its inclinations, is habituated to subjection, like a wild and refractory steed. The ancient monks, with a view to yield obedience to this precept contrived many exercises of discipline, for they slept on benches, they forced themselves to long watchings, and shunned delicacies. The main thing, however, was wanting in them, for they did not apprehend why it was that the Apostle enjoins this, because they lost sight of another injunction — </p><p>to take no concern for our flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof. <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_13:14</span>.) </p><p>For what he says elsewhere (<span class="bvs">1Ti_4:8</span>) always holds good — that <em>bodily exercise profiteth little</em>. Let us, however, treat the body so as to make a slave of it, <span class="cite-ref">(519)</span> that it may not, by its wantonness, keep us back from the duties of piety; and farther, that we may not indulge it, so as to occasion injury, or offense, to others. </p><p><em>That, when I have preached to others </em>Some explain these words in this way — “Lest, after having taught others with propriety and faithfulness, I should incur the judgment of condemnation in the sight of God by a wicked life.” But it will suit better to view this expression as referring to men, in this way — “My life ought to be a kind of rule to others. Accordingly, I strive to conduct myself in such a manner, that my character and conduct may not be inconsistent with my doctrine, and that thus I may not, with great disgrace to myself, and a grievous occasion of offense to my brethren, neglect those things which I require from others.” It may also be taken in connection with a preceding statement, (<span class="bvs">1Co_9:23</span>,) in this way — “Lest I should be defrauded of the gospel, of which others are partakers through means of my labors.” </p><p><strong>(516)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais ie matte et reduy en seruitude mort corps</span>;” — “But I mortify my body, and bring it into servitude.” </p><p><strong>(517)</strong> Its original meaning is to strike <em>under the eye</em>, being compounded of <span class="lang el-gr">ὑπό</span>, (<em>under</em>,) and <span class="lang el-gr">ὤψ</span>, (<em>the eye</em>,) to beat black and blue, as the wrestlers were accustomed to do with the <em>cestus </em> (See Arist. Pac. 541.) — <em>Ed </em></p><p><strong>(518)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Manier rudement et d’une faqon seruile</span>;” — “To handle roughly, and in a servile manner.” </p><p><strong>(519)</strong> Our author has evidently in view the literal meaning of the original word here used <span class="lang el-gr">δουλαγωγῶ</span>, <em>I reduce to slavery </em>It is used in this sense by Diodorus Siculus. (12. 24.) — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
