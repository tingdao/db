<div class="comment-content"><p>He mentions here some other duties, but for the same purpose of showing, that the fear of God is not proved by ceremonies, but by acting justly towards our brethren, and not by abstaining only from doing wrong, but by being ready to help the miserable. As widows, and orphans, and strangers are exposed as it were to plunder, Moses often in the law recommends them to favor, and shows that God cares for them, and will be their defender, when by one injured. So also the Prophet speaks here expressly of widows, and orphans, and strangers, that the Jews might understand, not only that they were to take heed, lest any one, being wronged, should complain, or lest any one should retaliate an injury, but that they were to observe integrity before God; for the ungodly are often terrified by fear, and refrain from doing mischief, because they know that there will be an avenger. Hence it comes that the rich and the opulent are safe from all injuries, because they are surrounded and fortified by strong defences; but the widows and the orphans are not thus able to repel wrongs. This is the reason why the Prophet prefers here to mention widows, and orphans, and strangers, rather than to speak indiscriminately of all the people. For the import of the whole is, as I have reminded you, that the fear of God is not really proved, except when a person cleaves to what is just and right, and is not restrained by fear or shame, but discharges his duty as it were in the presence of God and of his angels, so that he shows favor to the poor and miserable, who are without any to help them. But as I have elsewhere explained this subject more at large, it is enough now briefly to touch on it. <span class="cite-ref">(73)</span> Let us proceed — </p><p><strong>(73)</strong> There is one sentence passed by unnoticed, rendered thus by <em>Newcome</em>, — </p><p>Neither imagine in your heart <LineBreak />Every man evil againsthis brother. </p><p>Verbatim it is— </p><p>And the evil of (or, evil to) man, his brother, <LineBreak />Devise ye not in your heart. </p><p>They were not to devise or contrive in their hearts any evil or wrong to man, he being a brother. This sense is given in the <em>Targum</em>, and by <em>Grotius</em>, <em>Henry</em>, and others; but <em>Henderson</em>, following the <em>Septuagint</em>, gives another meaning; and his version or rather paraphrase is — </p><p>And think not in your heart of the injury <LineBreak />Which one hath done to another. </p><p>But the original can hardly admit of such a construction: the former, no doubt, is the true meaning. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
