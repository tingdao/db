We know how severely, on other occasions, Christ threatens and curses that city, (<span class="bvs">Mat_11:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_10:13</span>.) Accordingly, when God brought into favor with him some out of a nation so ungodly and wicked, we ought to view it in the same light as if they had been brought out of the lowest hell. And when Christ, after having drawn them out of that deep gulf, honors them so highly as to make them Apostles, it is a distinguished favor and worthy of being recorded. </p></div>
