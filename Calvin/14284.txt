<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>For in their hands is maliciousness. </em>The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">זמה</span><em>, zimmah, </em>signifies properly <em>an inward stratagem, </em>or <em>device. </em>But here it is not improperly applied to <em>the hands, </em>because David wished to intimate, that the wicked, of whom he was speaking, not only secretly imagined deceits, but also vigorously executed with their hands the malice which their hearts devised. When he farther says, <em>Their right hands are full of bribes, </em>we may infer from this, that it was not the common people whom he pointed out for observation, but the nobility themselves, who were most guilty of practising this corruption. Although the common and baser sort of men may be hired for reward, and suborned as agents in wickedness, yet we know that bribes are offered chiefly to judges, and other great men who are in power; and we likewise know, that at the time referred to here the worst of men bore sway. It was no wonder, therefore, that David complained that justice was exposed to sale. We are farther admonished by this expression, that those who delight in gifts can scarcely do otherwise than sell themselves to iniquity. Nor is it in vain, unquestionably, that God declares that </p><p>“gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the hearts of the righteous,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Deu_16:19</span>.) </p></div>
