<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet speaks of the rebuilding of the city. I doubt not but that his object was to shew them that the largeness and splendor of the city after the return of the people would not be less than it had been under David in its most flourishing condition. We must, however, first speak of the words before we proceed to the subject. </p><p><em>Behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, and built shall be the city </em>It was not as yet destroyed; but the Prophet intimated that its utter ruin was nigh at hand; he therefore makes now their hope to depend on God’s mercy alone, as to the deliverance of the people from exile: <em>Built </em>then <em>shall be the city to Jehovah from the tower of Hananeel, </em>etc. This tower was, no doubt, placed in the wall of the city. Almost the same prediction is found in <span class="bvs">Zec_14:10</span>, though there is some diversity in the words; but both the Prophets refer to the same thing. Zechariah’s object was to animate the people under this circumstance, because the beauty, greatness, and extent of the city did not at first correspond with what it had formerly been. He then promises that its glory would at length be the same as it had been; and he names there the <em>tower of Hananeel </em>Jeremiah adds, <em>to the gate of the corner </em>The corner, <span class="lang he-il">הפנה</span><em>ephene, </em>is in the singular number; but in Zechariah it is <span class="lang he-il">הפנים</span><em>ephenim, </em>in the plural; and it is thought that corners or corner is thus called metaphorically, because a corner shews two faces while it stands out, and thus two parts appear; but whether it be the gate of the corner or of the corners, it makes but little difference. </p></div>
