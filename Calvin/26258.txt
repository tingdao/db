<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>47.</strong><em>But if you do not believe his writings. </em>Christ appears here to claim less authority for himself than for Moses; and yet we know that <em>heaven and earth have been shaken by the voice </em>of the Gospel, (<span class="bvs">Heb_12:26</span>.) But Christ accommodates his discourse to those to whom he speaks; for the authority of the Law was, beyond all controversy, held sacred among the Jews; and thus it was impossible that Christ should be inferior to Moses. To the same purpose is the contrast between <em>writings </em>and <em>words</em>; for he shows their unbelief to be more aggravated, because the truth of God, recorded in an authentic form, has no authority with them. </p></div>
