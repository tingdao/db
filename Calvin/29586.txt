It is not without good reason that, as has been observed, he enters so much into detail in exposing the malice of the Jews. <span class="cite-ref">(546)</span> For as they furiously opposed the Gospel everywhere, there arose from this a great stumblingblock, more especially as they exclaimed that the gospel was profaned by Paul, when he published it among the Gentiles. By this calumny they made divisions in the Churches, they took away from the Gentiles the hope of salvation, and they obstructed the progress of the gospel. Paul, accordingly, charges them with this crime — that they regard the salvation of the Gentiles with envy, but adds, that matters are so, in order that their <em>sins may be filled up</em>, that he may take away from them all reputation for piety; just as in saying previously, that they <em>pleased not God</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Th_2:15</span>) he meant, that they were unworthy to be reckoned among the worshippers of God. The manner of expression, however, must be observed, implying that those who persevere in an evil course fill up by this means the measure of their judgment, <span class="cite-ref">(547)</span> until they come to make it a heap. This is the reason why the punishment of the wicked is often delayed — because their impieties, so to speak, are not yet ripe. By this we are warned that we must carefully take heed lest, in the event of our adding from time to time <span class="cite-ref">(548)</span> sin to sin, as is wont to happen generally, the heap at last reaches as high as heaven. </p><p><em>For wrath has come</em>. He means that they are in an utterly hopeless state, inasmuch as they are vessels of the Lord’s wrath. “The just vengeance of God presses upon them and pursues them, and will not leave them until they perish — as is the case with all the reprobate, who rush on headlong to death, to which they are destined.” The Apostle, however, makes this declaration as to the entire body of the people, in such a manner as not to deprive the elect of hope. For as the greater proportion resisted Christ, he speaks, it is true, of the whole nation generally, but we must keep in view the exception which he himself makes in <span class="bvs">Rom_11:5</span>, — that the Lord will always have some seed remaining. We must always keep in view Paul’s design — that believers must carefully avoid the society of those whom the just vengeance of God pursues, until they perish in their blind obstinacy. <em>Wrath</em>, without any additional term, means the judgment of God, as in <span class="bvs">Rom_4:15</span>, — <em>the law worketh </em>wrath; also in <span class="bvs">Rom_12:19</span>, — <em>neither give place unto </em>wrath </p><p><strong>(546)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il insiste si longuement a deschiffrer et toucher au vif la malice des Juifs</span>;” — “He insists to so great a length in distinctly unfolding and touching to the quick the malice of the Jews.” </p><p><strong>(547)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et condemnation</span>;” — “And condemnation.” </p><p><strong>(548)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Chacun iour</span>;” — “Every day.” </p></div>
