<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Offspring of vipers. </em>The similarity between <em>the tree </em>and <em>the fruit </em>is here applied by Christ to nothing more than speech, because this afforded an opportunity of detecting the inward and concealed malice of the scribes; and that is the reason why he dwells so much on this one kind of sin. It is because their falsehood and slanders betrayed what was not so visible in the rest of their life, that Christ attacks them with such severity. “There is no reason to wonder,” he says, “that you vomit out wicked words; for your heart is full of malice.” Nor are we to suppose that he ought to have treated them with greater gentleness, because some might regard this reproof as excessively severe. There are other sins, no doubt, that call for harsh reproofs; but when hypocritical persons pervert what is right, or put a false coloring on what is sinful, such wickedness renders it necessary that God should thunder against it in a more terrible manner than against other sins. </p><p>Now the design of Christ, suggested by the present occurrence, was to condemn the wicked sophistry which turns light into darkness. This passage shows how highly valuable in the sight of the Lord truth is, since he maintains and defends it with such rigor. Would that this were earnestly considered by those persons, whose ingenuity is too ready to be employed in defending any cause, and whose venal tongue disguises impostures! In a particular manner, Christ waxes wroth against those whom ambition, or envy, or some other fraudulent design, prompts to slander, even when there is nothing that their conscience condemns. Against the Pharisees, too, as his custom was, Christ used greater harshness, because they were so captivated by an unfounded conviction of their righteousness, that an ordinary warning had no effect upon them. And till hypocrites are sharply pierced, <span class="cite-ref">(136)</span> all that is said to them is treated with scorn and contempt. </p><p><em>How can you speak what is good? </em>We have formerly hinted, that proverbial sayings ought not to be rigidly interpreted as an invariable rule, for they state nothing more than the ordinary fact. Sometimes, no doubt, a cruel man will deceive the simple by honied flatteries, a cunning man will cheat under the garb of simplicity, and a man of very wicked thoughts will breathe almost angelical purity of language. <span class="cite-ref">(137)</span> But the ordinary practice demonstrates the truth of what Christ here says, that <em>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh; </em>agreeably to the old proverb, which declared the tongue to be the index of the mind. <span class="cite-ref">(138)</span> And, indeed, whatever hidden and crooked recesses may exist in the heart of man, and whatever may be the amazing contrivances by which every man conceals his vices, yet the Lord extorts from each of them some kind of confession, so that they discover by the tongue their natural disposition and hidden feelings. We must also observe the purpose for which Christ employs those parables; for he reproaches the Pharisees with having manifested by words the malice which they had inwardly conceived. Besides, knowing them to be sworn enemies, he takes occasion from, single calumny to expose their whole life, and to destroy their credit with the people, which gave them too great influence in deceiving and in doing mischief. Though <em>good </em>speeches do not always proceed from the inmost heart, but originate (as the phrase is) on the tip of the tongue, yet it is an invariable truth, that bad speeches are indications of a bad heart. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(136)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Iusques a ce qu’ils sentent qu’on le poigne a bon escient</span>;” — “till they feel that they are pierced in good earnest.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(137)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il semblera, a l’ouir parler, qu’il ait une purete Angelique</span>;” — “to hear him speak, you would imagine that he has the purity of an Angel.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(138)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme aussi le proverbe ancien portoit, Que la langue est le charactere ou pourtrait du coeur</span>;” — “as also the old proverb bore, That the tongue is the type or portrait of the heart.” </p></div></div>
