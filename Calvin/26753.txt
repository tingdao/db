<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Because you have loved me. </em>These words remind us that the only bond of our union with God is, to be united to Christ; and we are united to him by a faith which is not reigned, but which springs from sincere affection, which he describes by the name of <em>love</em>; for no man believes purely in Christ who does not cordially embrace him, and, therefore, by this word he has well expressed the power and nature of faith. But if it is only when we have loved Christ that God begins to love us, it follows that the commencement of salvation is from ourselves, because we have anticipated the grace of God. Numerous passages of Scripture, on the other hand, are opposed to this statement. The promise of God is, <em>I will cause them to love me</em>; and John says, <em>Not that we first loved Him</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(105)</span> (<span class="bvs">1Jo_4:10</span>.) It would be superfluous to collect many passages; for nothing is more certain than this doctrine, that the Lord <em>calleth those things which are not</em>, (<span class="bvs">Rom_4:17</span>) <em>raises the dead</em>, (<span class="bvs">Luk_7:22</span>,) unites himself to those who were <em>strangers </em>to him, (<span class="bvs">Eph_2:12</span>,) makes <em>hearts of flesh </em>out of <em>hearts of stone</em>, (<span class="bvs">Eze_36:26</span>,) manifests himself to <em>those who do not seek him</em>, (<span class="bvs">Isa_65:1</span>; <span class="bvs">Rom_10:20</span>.) I reply, God loves men in a secret way, before they are called, if they are among the elect; for he loves his own before they are created; but, as they are not yet reconciled, they are justly accounted <em>enemies </em>of God, as Paul speaks, </p><p>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_5:10</span>.) </p><p>On this ground it is said that we are <em>loved by God</em>, when we <em>love Christ</em>; because we have the pledge of the fatherly love of Him from whom we formerly recoiled as our offended Judge. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(105)</span> Quoting from memory, our Author has mingled two passages The first is, <em>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Jo_4:10</span>;) and the second is, <em>We love him, because he first loved us</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Jo_4:19</span>.) â€” <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
