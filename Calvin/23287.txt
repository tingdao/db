<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>That thy alms may be in secret </em>This statement appears to be opposed to many passages of Scripture, in which we are commanded to edify the brethren by good examples. But if we attend to the design of Christ, we must not give a more extensive meaning to the words. <span class="cite-ref">(427)</span> He commands his disciples to devote themselves to good works purely, and without any ambition. In order to do this, he bids them turn away their eyes from the sight of men, and to reckon it enough that their duties are approved by God alone. Such simplicity of views does not at all interfere with anxiety and zeal to promote edification: and, indeed, a little before, he did not expressly forbid them to do good before men, but condemned ostentation. </p><p><em>Thy Father, who seeth in secret </em>He silently glances at a kind of folly, which prevails everywhere among men, that they think they have lost their pains, if there have not been many spectators of their virtues. He tells them, that God does not need a strong light to perceive good actions: for those things, which appear to be buried in darkness, are open to his view. We have no reason, therefore, to suppose that what escapes the notice, and receives not the testimony of men, is lost: for “the Lord dwells in the thick darkness,” (<span class="bvs">2Ch_6:1</span>.) A most appropriate remedy is thus applied for curing the disease of ambition, when he reminds us to fix our <em>eye </em>on God: for this banishes from our minds, and will utterly destroy, all vain-glory. — In the second clause, which immediately follows, Christ reminds us that, in looking for the reward of good works, we must wait patiently till the last day, the day of resurrection. <em>Thy Father, </em>says he, <em>shall reward thee openly </em>But when? It will be, when the dawn of the last day shall arise, by which all that is now hidden in darkness shall be revealed. </p><p><strong>(427)</strong> “Verba longius trahere non oportet.” In some of the best Latin editions we find, “verba longius trahere nos oportet,” which entirely alters the meaning. But the discrepancy of the reading is set aside by the French version: “<span class="lang fr-fr">il ne faut point estendre les paroles plus avant</span>;” — “we must not extend the words farther.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
