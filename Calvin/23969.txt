<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And many false prophets will arise. </em>This warning differs from the former, in which Christ foretold that <em>many would come in his name. </em>For there he spoke only of impostors, who, shortly after the commencement of the Gospel, gave out that they were <em>the Christ; </em>but now he threatens that in all ages false teachers will arise, to corrupt sound doctrine, as Peter tells us (<span class="bvs">2Pe_2:1</span>) that the Church will be no less exposed to this evil under the Gospel than it anciently was under the Law. There is therefore no reason why error, and certain impostures of the devil and corruptions of piety, should strike pious minds with dismay; since no man is properly founded on Christ, who has not learned that we must stand firm against such attacks; for this is the undoubted trial of our faith, when it is in no degree shaken by the false doctrines which arise, or does he only say that <em>false prophets will come, </em>but likewise that they will be so crafty as to <em>deceive </em>and draw away sects after them. <span class="cite-ref">(133)</span> No ordinary caution is necessary here; for the multitude of those who are going astray is like a violent tempest, which compels us to leave the course, if we are not firmly fixed on God. On this subject something was said but lately. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(133)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En sorte qu’ils auront des disciples, et feront des sectes</span>;” — “so that they will have disciples, and will form sects.” </p></div></div>
