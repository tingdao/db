<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>It is as a slaughter in my bones. </em>This verse is somewhat involved in point of expression; but as to the meaning of it there is no obscurity. David here affirms that the grief which he experienced from the reproaches of his enemies, wounded him in no degree less than if they had pierced through his bones. The word <span class="lang he-il">ברצה</span><em>, beretsach, </em>signifies <em>killing; </em>and, therefore, I have retained this idea in the translation of it. And yet I do not condemn the opinion of those who render it <em>a slaughtering sword. </em><span class="cite-ref">(124)</span> There is here a difference as to the reading, arising from the great similarity which there is between the two letters <span class="lang he-il">ב</span><em>, beth, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">כ</span><em>, caph, </em>the mark of similitude. As the letter <span class="lang he-il">ב</span><em>beth, </em>is often superfluous, I would rather be disposed, in a doubtful matter like this, to omit it altogether. But as I have said, the sense is perfectly plain, except that interpreters do not seem to take this sufficiently into their consideration, that by the terms <em>my bones, </em>the bitterness of grief is referred to; for we feel much more acutely any injury which is done to the bones, than if a sword should pierce the bowels, or the other parts of the body which are soft and yielding. Nor should the children of God regard this similitude as hyperbolical; and if one should wonder why David took so sorely to heart the derision of his enemies, he only manifests in this his own insensibility. For of all the bitter evils which befall us, there is nothing which can inflict upon us a severer wound than to see the wicked tear in pieces the majesty of God, and endeavor to destroy and overturn our faith. The doctrine taught by Paul, (<span class="bvs">Gal_4:24</span>,) concerning the persecution of Ishmael, is well known. Many consider his childish jesting as of little moment, but as it tended to this effect, that the covenant of God should be esteemed as a thing of no value, it is on that account, according to the judgment of the Holy Spirit, to be accounted a most cruel persecution. David, therefore, with much propriety, compares to a slaughtering sword, which penetrates even within the bones and marrow, the derision of his enemies, by which he saw his own faith and the word of God trampled under foot. And would to God that all who boast themselves of being his children would learn to bear their private wrongs more patiently, and to manifest the same vehement zeal for which David is here distinguished, when their faith is assailed to the dishonor of God, and when the word also which gives them life is included in the same reproach! </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(124)</span> The original word <span class="lang he-il">רצח</span><em>retsach</em>, is constantly used in prose for a <em>homicide</em>, or <em>murderer</em>, being derived from the verb <span class="lang he-il">רצח</span><em>ratsach</em>, which signifies <em>to slay</em>, <em>to murder</em>; and although it is not used in any other passage for <em>a sword</em>, “it may,” as Horsley observes, “very naturally, in poetry, be applied to the instrument of slaughter, the sword.” In support of this view, he refers to a passage in one of the tragedies of Sophocles, in which Ajax calls his sword, upon which he is about to fall, <span class="lang el-gr">Ο σφαγεὺς </span> which gives the literal rendering of the Hebrew <span class="lang he-il">רצח</span>, <em>retsach</em>, <em>murderer </em>Horsley’s rendering is, “While the sword is in my bones.” </p></div></div>
