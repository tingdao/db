<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Lo, I have foretold it to you. Mark </em>expresses our Lordâ€™s meaning more fully. <em>But take heed: lo, I have foretold you all things. </em>By these words we are taught that they who are dismayed by the stumbling-blocks which Christ predicted are altogether inexcusable; for since the will of God ought to be our rule, it is sufficient that we have received timely warning that such is his pleasure. Again, as he declares that </p><p>he is faithful, and will not suffer us to be tempted beyond <LineBreak />what we are able to bear, (<span class="bvs">1Co_10:13</span>,) </p><p>we shall never be in want of strength to resist, provided that our weakness be not nourished by indifference. </p></div>
