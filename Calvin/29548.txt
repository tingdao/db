He requires suavity of speech, such as may allure the hearers by its profitableness, for he does not merely condemn communications that are openly wicked or impious, but also such as are worthless and idle. Hence he would have them <em>seasoned with salt</em>. Profane men have their seasonings of discourse, <span class="cite-ref">(472)</span> but he does not speak of them; nay more, as witticisms are insinuating, and for the most part procure favor, <span class="cite-ref">(473)</span> he indirectly prohibits believers from the practice and familiar use of them. For he reckons as tasteless everything that does not edify. The term <em>grace </em>is employed in the same sense, so as to be opposed to talkativeness, taunts, and all sorts of trifles which are either injurious or vain. <span class="cite-ref">(474)</span></p><p><em>That ye may know how. </em>The man who has accustomed himself to caution in his communications will not fall into many absurdities, into which talkative and prating persons fall into from time to time, but, by constant practice, will acquire for himself expertness in making proper and suitable replies; as, on the other hand, it must necessarily happen, that silly talkers expose themselves to derision whenever they are interrogated as to anything; and in this they pay the just punishment of their silly talkativeness. Nor does he merely say <em>what</em>, but also <em>how</em>, and not to all indiscriminately, but to <em>every one</em>. For this is not the least important part of prudence — to have due regard to individuals. <span class="cite-ref">(475)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(472)</span>Sales.
