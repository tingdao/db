He corrects both of the faults of which he had made mention — a blustering restlessness, and retirement from useful employment. He accordingly exhorts them, in the first place, to cultivate repose — that is, to keep themselves <em>quietly </em>within the limits of their calling, or, as we commonly say, “<em class="lang fr-fr">sans faire bruit </em>,” (<em>without making a noise</em>.) For the truth is this: those are the most peaceable of all, that exercise themselves in lawful employments; <span class="cite-ref">(722)</span> while those that have nothing to do give trouble both to themselves and to others. Further, he subjoins another precept — that they should <em>labor</em>, that is, that they should be intent upon their calling, and devote themselves to lawful and honorable employments, without which the life of man is of a wandering nature. Hence, also, there follows this third injunction — that they should <em>eat their own bread; </em>by which he means, that they should be satisfied with what belongs to them, that they may not be oppressive or unreasonable to others. </p><p>Drink water, <em>says Solomon</em>, from thine own fountains, and let the streams flow down to neighbors. (<span class="bvs">Pro_5:15</span>.) </p><p>This is the <em>first </em>law of equity, that no one make use of what belongs to another, but only use what he can properly call his own. The <em>second </em>is, that no one swallow up, like some abyss, what belongs to him, but that he be beneficent to neighbors, and that he may relieve their indigence by his abundance. <span class="cite-ref">(723)</span> In the same manner, the Apostle exhorts those who had been formerly idle to <em>labor</em>, not merely that they may gain for themselves a livelihood, but that they may also be helpful to the necessities of their brethren, as he also teaches elsewhere. (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:28</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(722)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceux qui s’exercent a bon escient en quelque labeur licite</span>;” — “Those that exercise themselves in good earnest in any lawful employment.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(723)</span> See Calvin on the Corinthians; vol. 2, p. 286. </p></div></div>
