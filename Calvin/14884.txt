<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>For thou, O God! hast proved us </em>We may read, <em>Though thou, O God! etc., </em>and then the passage comes in as a qualification of what went before, and is brought forward by the Psalmist to enhance the goodness of God, who had delivered them from such severe calamities. But there is another object which I consider him to have in view, and this is the alleviation of the grief of God’s people, by setting before them the comfort suggested by the words which follow. When visited with affliction, it is of great importance that we should consider it as coming from God, and as expressly intended for our good. It is in reference to this that the Psalmist speaks of their having been <em>proved and tried. </em>At the same time, while he adverts to God’s trying his children with the view of purging away their sin, as dross is expelled from the silver by fire, he would intimate, also, that trial had been made of their patience. The figure implies that their probation had been severe; for silver is cast repeatedly into the furnace. They express themselves thankful to God, that, while proved with affliction, they had not been destroyed by it; but that their affliction was both varied and very severe, appears not only from the metaphor, but from the whole context, where they speak of having been cast into the net, being reduced to straits, men riding over their heads, and of being brought through shipwreck and conflagration. <span class="cite-ref">(477)</span> The expression, <em>laying a restraint </em>[or <em>chain </em>]<em>upon their loins, </em>is introduced as being stronger than the one which goes before. It was not a net of thread which had been thrown over them, but rather they had been bound down with hard and insolvable fetters. The expression which follows refers to men who had shamefully tyrannised over them, and ridden them down as cattle. By <em>fire </em>and <em>water </em>are evidently meant complicated afflictions; and it is intimated that God had exercised his people with every form of calamity. They are the two elements which contribute more than any other to sustain human life, but are equally powerful for the destruction of it. It is noticeable, that the Psalmist speaks of all the cruelties which they had most unjustly suffered from the hands of their enemies, as an infliction of Divine punishment; and would guard the Lord’s people against imagining that God was ignorant of what they had endured, or distracted by other things from giving attention to it. In their condition, as here described, we have that of the Church generally represented to us; and this, that when subjected to vicissitudes, and cast out of the fire into the water, by a succession of trials, there may at last be felt to be nothing new or strange in the event to strike us with alarm. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">רויה</span>,<em>revayah, </em>which I have rendered <em>fruitful place, </em>means literally <em>a well-watered land. </em>Here it is taken metaphorically for a condition of prosperity, the people of God being represented as brought into a pleasant and fertile place, where there is abundance of pasturage. The truth conveyed is, that God, although he visit his children with temporary chastisements of a severe description, will ultimately crown them with joy and prosperity. It is a mistake to suppose that the allusion is entirely to their being settled in the land of Canaan, <span class="cite-ref">(478)</span> for the psalm has not merely reference to the troubles which they underwent in the wilderness, but to the whole series of distresses to which they were subjected at the different periods of their history. </p><p><strong>(477)</strong> “Per naufragium et incendium transiisse.” The French version reads, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par l’eau et par le feu</span>;” but it is important to retain the original more closely, as giving what Calvin considered to be the sense of the words in the text. Fire and water, the one of which elements consumes, while the other suffocates, is a proverbial expression, signifying, as our author afterwards states, extreme danger and complicated calamities. “When thou passest through the <em>waters</em>, I will be with thee; when thou walkest through the <em>fire</em>, thou shalt not be burnt,” <span class="bvs">Isa_43:2</span>. See also <span class="bvs">Psa_32:6</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_16:6</span>; <span class="bvs">Num_31:23</span>. Those things are said to come into or to pass through the fire, which abide the same, without being consumed; and which, like metals, lose only thereby their dross. </p><p><strong>(478)</strong> Cresswell takes this view. His note on the place is, “‘<em>Into </em>a wealthy place,’ literally <em>into </em>an irriguous region, (comp. <span class="bvs">Jud_1:15</span>,)<em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , into a fertile country, a land of abundance, the promised land: comp. <span class="bvs">Exo_3:8</span>.” </p></div>
