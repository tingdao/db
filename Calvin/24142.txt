<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>He answered nothing. </em>If it be asked why the Evangelists say that Christ was silent, while we have just now heard his answer from their mouth, the reason is, that he had a defense at hand, but voluntarily abstained from producing it. And, indeed, what he formerly replied about <em>the kingdom </em>did not arise from a desire to be acquitted, but was only intended to maintain that he was the Redeemer anciently promised, </p><p>before whom every knee ought to bow, (<span class="bvs">Isa_45:23</span>.) </p><p><em>Pilate wondered </em>at this patience; for Christ, by his silence, allowed his innocence to be suspected, when he might easily have refuted frivolous and unfounded calumnies. The integrity of Christ was such that the judge saw it plainly without any defense. But Pilate wished that Christ might not neglect his own cause, and might thus be acquitted without giving offense to many people. And up to this point, the integrity of Pilate is worthy of commendation, because, from a favorable regard to the innocence of Christ, he urges him to defend himself. </p><p>But that we may not, like Pilate, wonder at the silence of Christ, as if it had been unreasonable, we must attend to the purpose of God, who determined that his Son—whom he had appointed to be a sacrifice to atone for our sins—should be condemned as guilty in our room, though in himself he was pure. Christ therefore was at that time silent, that he may now be our advocate, and by his intercession may deliver us from condemnation. He was silent, that we may boast that by his grace we are righteous. And thus was fulfilled the prediction of Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_53:7</span>,) that he was led as a sheep to the slaughter. </p><p>And yet he gave, at the same time, that <em>good confession, </em>which Paul mentions, (<span class="bvs">1Ti_6:12</span>,) a <em>confession </em>not by words, but by deeds; not that by which he consulted his own advantage, but that by which he obtained deliverance for the whole human race. </p></div>
