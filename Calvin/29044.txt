For his discourse did not apply to the entire body of the Church, but to certain diseased and half-rotten members of it. Hence he now, with greater freedom, uses sharpness, because he has to do with particular individuals, not with the whole body of the people, and besides this, it was with persons of such a stamp, that he perceived, that he would do them no good by kindness, and mild remedies. After having spent a year and a half among them, (<span class="bvs">Act_18:11</span>,) he had visited them a <em>second </em>time. Now he forewarns them, that he will come to them a <em>third </em>time, and he says, that his three comings to them will be in the place of three witnesses. He quotes the law as to the authority of witnesses; not in the natural and literal sense, as it is termed, but by accommodation, <span class="cite-ref">(943)</span> or similitude, applying it to his particular purpose. </p><p>“The declaration of the law,” says he, “is, that we must rest on the testimony of <em>two or three witnesses </em>for putting an end to disputes.” <span class="cite-ref">(944)</span> (<span class="bvs">Deu_19:15</span>.) </p><p>For the word <em>established </em>means that a decision is pronounced respecting a matter, that the strife may cease. “I, indeed, am but one individual, but coming a <em>third </em>time I shall have the authority of <em>three </em>witnesses, or, my three comings will be in the place of three testimonies.” For the threefold effort that was made for their welfare, and perseverance, as made trial of on three different occasions, might, with good reason, be held equivalent to three persons. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(943)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><em>Anagogen </em> ” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(944)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>This is only an allusion: it is taken, with a trifling abridgement, from the Alexandrine copy of the Septuagint, which is an exact translation of the <em>Hebrew. </em>” — <em>Horne’s </em>Introduction, (Lond. 1823,) volume 2 — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
