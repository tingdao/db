<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>For ye are not come, etc. </em>He fights now with a new argument, for he proclaims the greatness of the grace made known by the Gospel, that we may reverently receive it; and secondly, he commends to us its benign characters that he might allure us to love and desire it. He adds weight to these two things by a comparison between the Law and the Gospel; for the higher the excellency of Christ’s kingdom than the dispensation of Moses, and the more glorious our calling than that of the ancient people, the more disgraceful and the less excusable is our ingratitude, unless we embrace in a becoming manner the great favor offered to us, and humbly adore the majesty of Christ which is here made evident; and then, as God does not present himself to us clothed in terrors as he did formerly to the Jews, but lovingly and kindly invites us to himself, so the sin of ingratitude will be thus doubled, except we willingly and in earnest respond to his gracious invitation. <span class="cite-ref">(260)</span></p><p>Then let us first remember that the Gospel is here compared with the Law; and secondly, that there are two parts in this comparison, — that God’s glory displays itself more illustriously in the Gospel than in the Law, — and that his invitation is now full of love, but that formerly there was nothing but the greatest terrors. </p><p><em>Unto the mount that might be touched, </em><span class="cite-ref">(261)</span><em>etc. </em>This sentence is variously expounded; but it seems to me that an earthly mountain is set in opposition to the spiritual; and the words which follow show the same thing, <em>that burned with fire, blackness, darkness, tempest, </em>etc.; for these were signs which God manifested, that he might secure authority and reverence to his Law. <span class="cite-ref">(262)</span> When considered in themselves they were magnificent and truly celestial; but when we come to the kingdom of Christ, the things which God exhibits to us are far above all the heavens. It hence follows, that all the dignity of the Law appears now earthly: thus mount Sinai might have been touched by hands; but mount Sion cannot be known but by the spirit. All the things recorded in the nineteenth chapter of <span class="bvs">Exo_19:1</span> were visible things; but those which we have in the kingdom of Christ are hid from the senses of the flesh. <span class="cite-ref">(263)</span></p><p>Should any one object and say, that the meaning of all these things was spiritual, and that there are at this day external exercises of religion by which we are carried up to heaven: to this I answer, that the Apostle speaks comparatively; and no one can doubt but that the Gospel, contrasted with the Law, excels in what is spiritual, but the Law in earthly symbols. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(260)</span> The connection of this part has been viewed by some to be the following: — Having exhorted the Hebrews to peace and holiness, and warned them against apostasy and sinful indulgences, the Apostle now enforces his exhortations and warnings by showing the superiority of the Gospel over the Law. This is the view of Doddridge and Stuart. It appears that Scott connected this part with <span class="bvs">Heb_10:28</span>, and that he considered that the object of the apostle was to bring forward an instance, in addition to former ones, of the superiority of the Gospel, in order to show that the neglect of it would involve a greater guilt than that of the Law. And this appears to have been the view of Calvin, which seems to be favored by the concluding part of the chapter. The word<span class="lang el-gr">γὰρ </span> may be rendered “moreover.” — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(261)</span> It has been conjectured that<span class="lang el-gr">μὴ </span> has been omitted before “touched;” for in that case the passage would more exactly correspond with the account given in Exodus, for the people were expressly forbidden to touch the mountain. An omission of this kind was surely not impossible. The phrase as it is hardly admits of a grammatical construction: it has been found necessary to give the sense of an adjective to the participle. There would not be this necessity were the words rendered “To a mount not to be touched and burning with fire, and to,” etc. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(262)</span> The words used here are not taken literally from the Hebrew nor from the Sept. the four things mentioned in this verse, and the two things mentioned in the following verse, are found in the narrative in <span class="bvs">Exo_19:0</span> and 20; but not consecutively as here; nor are the same terms used. “Blackness<span class="lang el-gr">” γνόφῳ, </span> should be “a dark or thick cloud,” <span class="bvs">Exo_19:16</span>. “Tempest<span class="lang el-gr">,” θυέλλη, </span> is not mentioned in Exodus or in Deuteronomy; but it includes evidently “the thunders and lightnings” mentioned twice at least in Exodus, [<span class="bvs">Exo_19:16</span> ] ] though not once in Deuteronomy. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(263)</span> “The Hebrews,” says Grotius, “came in the body to a material mountain, but we in spirit to that which is spiritual.” </p></div></div>
