<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>Having beaten them, they commanded. </em>He saith that Gamaliel’s counsel was allowed; yet the apostles are beaten, and forbidden to preach. <span class="cite-ref">(293)</span> Hereby we gather how great the rage of the enemies was, who being now pacified, or at least mitigated, do yet, notwithstanding, rage immoderately. <span class="cite-ref">(294)</span> And it appeareth also what evil success those doubtful counsels have, wherein men alone are respected, and the truth of God set aside. Gamaliel obtaineth thus much, that the lives of the apostles may be saved; <span class="cite-ref">(295)</span> but, in the mean season, the Son of God is blasphemed and slandered in their person; the truth of the gospel is buried in eternal silence, so much as in the enemies lieth, God surely doth by this means wonderfully spread abroad his word; yet that counsel ceaseth not to be evil. Which we must note for this cause, because most men at this day do think, that they do not a little obey God, if they save the lives of those men which come in hazard for the doctrine of the gospel, or somewhat appease <span class="cite-ref">(296)</span> the enemies who are otherwise bloody. In the mean season, they are not afraid to drive them unto the wicked denial of Christ, the confessing of whom is far more precious in the sight of God than the life of all men. But what could they do who, casting away all care of godliness, go about to redeem God’s favor with the duty of courtesy? <span class="cite-ref">(297)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(293)</span> “Docere,” to teach. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(294)</span> “Adeo tamen intemperanter se gerunt,” yet conduct themselves to intemperately. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(295)</span> “Parcatur,” may be spared. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(296)</span> “Flectant ad lenitatem.” incline to lenity. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(297)</span> “Humanitatis officio se qpud Deum redimere volunt,” would purchase the favor of God to themselves by an act of humanity. </p></div></div>
