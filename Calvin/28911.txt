By the <em>same requital </em>he means — mutual duty, for there is a mutual return of duty between a father and his sons. For as it is the duty of parents to nourish their children, to instruct them, to direct them by their counsel, and to defend them, so it is the dictate of equity, that children should <em>requite their parents. </em>(<span class="bvs">1Ti_5:4</span>.) In fine, he means what the Greeks call <span class="lang el-gr">ἀντιπελαργίαν</span> —<em>affection exercised in return. </em><span class="cite-ref">(606)</span> “I cherish,” says he, “towards you paternal affection: show yourselves then to be my sons by affection and respect in return.” At the same time there is a particular circumstance that must be noticed, That the Corinthians, having found so indulgent a father, may also show gentleness in their turn, and may requite his kind condescension by their docility, he exhorts them with this view to be <em>enlarged in their own bowels. </em>The Old Interpreter, not having caught Paul’s meaning, has added the participle <em>having, </em>and has thus expressed his own view rather than Paul’s. In our exposition, on the other hand, (which is Chrysostom’s, also,) there is nothing forced. <span class="cite-ref">(607)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(606)</span> The term <span class="lang el-gr">ἀντιπελαργία</span> is compounded of <span class="lang el-gr">αντι</span> over against, and <span class="lang el-gr">λαργος</span>, a stork. It is employed to denote <em>reciprocal affection</em>, from an interesting peculiarity in the disposition of the <em>stork</em>. “This bird,” says Paxton, in his Illustrations of Scripture, (Edin. 1842,) volume 2, p. 432, “has long been celebrated for her amiable and pious dispositions, in which she has no rival among the feathered race. Her kind benevolent temper she discovers in feeding her parents in the time of incubation, when they have not leisure to seek their food, or when they have become old, and unable to provide for themselves.” The English word <em>stork </em>is derived from <span class="lang el-gr">στοργὴ</span>, affection, while the Hebrew name for this animal, <span class="lang he-il">חסידה</span>, (<em>chasidah</em>,) is derived from <span class="lang he-il">חסד</span> (<em>chesed</em>,) <em>beneficence</em>, because, says <em>Bythner</em>, “the stork nourishes, supports, and carries on its back, when weary, its aged parents.” See Calvin on the Psalms, vol. 4, p. 158, n. 2 Calvin, when commenting on <span class="bvs">1Ti_5:4</span>, says, “Ips’ quoque ciconi’ gratitudinem suo exemplo nos docent. Unde et nomen<span class="lang el-gr">ἀντιπελαργία</span>;” — “The very storks, too, teach us gratitude by their example. Hence the term <span class="lang el-gr">ἀντιπελαργία</span> — affection in return.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(607)</span> The rendering of the Vulgate — “Eandem remunerationem <em>habentes </em>;” — “<em>Having </em>the same reward,” — is followed by. Wiclif, (1380,) <em>ye that haw the same reward </em>and also in the Rheims version, (1582,) <em>hauing the same reward</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
