<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>45.</strong><em>It is written in the Prophets. </em>Christ confirms by the testimony of Isaiah what he said, that <em>no man can come to him</em>, <em>unless he be drawn by the Father </em>He uses the word<em>prophets </em>in the plural number, because all their prophecies had been collected into one volume, so that all <em>the prophets </em>might justly be accounted one book. The passage which is here quoted is to be found in <span class="bvs">Isa_54:13</span>, where, speaking of the restoration of the Church, he promises to her, <em>sons taught by the instruction of God </em>Hence it may easily be inferred, that the Church cannot be restored in any other way than by God undertaking the office of a Teacher, and bringing believers to himself. The way of teaching, of which the prophet speaks, does not consist merely in the external voice, but likewise in the secret operation of the Holy Spirit. In short, this <em>teaching </em>of God is the inward illumination of the heart. </p><p><em>And they shall be all taught by God. </em>As to the word <em>all, </em>it must be limited to the elect, who alone are the true children of the Church. Now it is not difficult to see in what manner Christ applies this prediction to the present subject. Isaiah shows that then only is the Church truly edified, when she has <em>her children taught by God </em>Christ, therefore, justly concludes that men have not eyes to behold the light of life, until God has opened them. But at the same time, he fastens on the general phrase,<em>all; </em>because he argues from it, that <em>all </em>who are <em>taught by God </em>are effectually drawn, so as to come; and to this relates what he immediately adds, </p><p><em>Whosoever therefore hath heard my Father. </em>The amount of what is said is, that all who do not believe are reprobate and doomed to destruction; because all <em>the sons </em>of the Church and heirs of life are made by God to be his obedient disciples. Hence it follows, that there is not one of all the elect of God who shall not be a partaker of faith in Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(154)</span> Again, as Christ formerly affirmed that men are not fitted for believing, until they have been <em>drawn</em>, so he now declares that the grace of Christ, by which they are <em>drawn</em>, is efficacious, so that they necessarily believe. </p><p>These two clauses utterly overturn the whole power of free will, of which the Papists dream. For if it be only when the Father has <em>drawn </em>us that we begin to <em>come to Christ, </em>there is not in us any commencement of faith, or any preparation for it. On the other hand, if all come <em>whom the Father hath taught</em>, He gives to them not only the choice of believing, but faith itself. When, therefore, we willingly yield to the guidance of the Spirit, this is a part, and, as it were, a sealing of grace; because God would not <em>draw </em>us, if He were only to stretch out his hand, and leave our will in a state of suspense. But in strict propriety of language He is said to draw us, when He extends the power of his Spirit to the full effect of faith. They are said to <em>hear </em>God, who willingly assent to God speaking to them within, because the Holy Spirit reigns in their hearts. </p><p><em>Cometh to me. </em>He shows the inseparable connection that exists between him and the Father. For the meaning is, that it is impossible that any who are God’s disciples shall not obey Christ, and that they who reject Christ refuse to be<em>taught by God; </em>because the only wisdom that all the elect learn in the school of God is, to come to Christ; for the Father, who sent him, cannot deny himself. </p><p><strong>(154)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il n’y en a pas un de tous les eleus de Dieu qui ne viene a estre participant de la foy</span>.” </p></div>
