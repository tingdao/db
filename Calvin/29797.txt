<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>They who wish to be rich </em>After having exhorted him to be content, and to despise riches, he now explains how dangerous is the desire of having them, and especially in the ministers of the Church, of whom he expressly speaks in this passage. Now the cause of the evils, which the Apostle here enumerates, is not riches, but an eager desire of them, even though the person should be poor. And here Paul shews not only what generally happens, but what must always happen; for every man that has resolved to become rich gives himself up as a captive to the devil. Most true is that saying of the heathen poet, — “He who is desirous of becoming rich is also desirous of acquiring riches soon.” <span class="cite-ref">(123)</span> Hence it follows, that all who are violently desirous of acquiring wealth rush headlong. </p><p>Hence also those <em>foolish, </em>or rather, <em>mad desires, which </em>at length <em>plunge them into perdition</em>. This is, indeed, a universal evil; but in the pastors of the Church it is more easily seen; for they are so maddened by avarice, that they stick at nothing, however foolish, whenever the glitter of gold or silver dazzles their eyes. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(123)</span> “Dives fieri qui vult, Et cito vult fieri.” — <em>Juvenal</em>. </p></div></div>
