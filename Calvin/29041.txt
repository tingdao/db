<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Do you again think. </em>As those that are conscious to themselves of something wrong are sometimes more anxious than others to clear themselves, it is probable, that this, also, was turned into a ground of calumny â€” that Paul had in the former Epistle applied himself to a defense of his ministry. Farther, it is a fault in the servants of Christ, to be too much concerned as to their own reputation. With the view, therefore, of repelling those calumnies, he declares in the <em>first </em>place, that he speaks in the presence of God, whom evil consciences always dread. In the <em>second </em>place, he maintains, that he has not so much a <em>view </em>to himself, as to them. He was prepared to go through <em>good report and bad report, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_6:8</span>,) nay, even to be reduced to nothing; but it was of advantage to the Corinthians, that he should retain the reputation that he deserved, that his ministry might not be brought into contempt. </p></div>
