<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet again addresses the Persians and the Medes, and encourages them to come against Babylon. We stated yesterday that the prophets are went to speak with authority, because they sustained the person of God; and we mentioned how necessary this mode of speaking was, for the world does not acknowledge that God speaks effectually. </p><p>Then he says first, <em>Come ye against her; </em><span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> and then, <em>Open her storehouses </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">מאבס</span>, <em>meabes, </em>means a cornhouse or a repository of any kind: hence some render it <em>“granaries.” </em>But it seems to me that the word is thus too much restricted, for the Prophet no doubt speaks of the treasures of Babylon. Now storehouses, <em>(apothecas,) </em>the Greeks call those repositories which contain all sorts of things, not only wine and oil, but goods of merchants, and also money. We call them in French, <em>Arrieres-boutiques, </em>or, <em>magasins. </em>But this word is to be extended to wine, to every kind of fruit, and then to treasures, and also to arms; for they were repositories of arms, of weapons of every kind. It is the same as though Jeremiah had said, that nothing would be so hidden among the Chaldeans but that the Medes and the Persians would find it out. </p><p>He then adds, <em>Tread her as heaps. </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">ערמים</span>, <em>oremim, </em>means not heaps of stones, but on the contrary, of sheaves. Then he intimates that the Persians and the Medes would act cruelly, and tread them as corn is trodden on the floor. <span class="cite-ref">(68)</span> He lastly says, <em>Destroy her utterly, that there way be to her no remnant </em>He seems indirectly to set this in contrast with what God promised always to his people, that there would be some remnant, he then says that nothing would remain when God had executed his vengeance on the Chaldeans. The sum of what is said is, that the punishment of which the Prophet speaks would be such as would obliterate the very name of the Babylonian monarchy. This, as we said yesterday and also previously, was not completed in one day. But when the Prophets speak of God’s judgments, they do not regard only the preludes, but their words extend to the last judgment that awaits all the reprobate. It now follows, — </p><p><strong>(67)</strong> It is added, “from the extremity,” <em>i.e., </em>of heaven, according to a parallel passage in <span class="bvs">Isa_13:5</span>. They were to come from the farthest parts of the earth then known. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(68)</strong> The most approved rendering is, “Cast (or throw) her up as heaps,” <em>i.e., </em>of rubbish, according to <span class="bvs">Jer_51:37</span>. It is said that the verb here never means to tread under foot, “Make her, of a goodly, stately city, nothing but heaps of earth, stones, and rubbish.” <em>Gataker. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
