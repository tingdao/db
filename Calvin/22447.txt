<div class="comment-content"><p>It follows, <em>Take away from me the multitude of thy songs </em>By speaking of multitude, he aims at hypocrites, who toil much in their devices without measure or end, as we see done at this day by those under the Papacy; for they accumulate endless forms of worship, and greatly weary themselves, morning and evening; in short, they spend days and nights in performing their ceremonies, and every one devises some new thing, and all these they heap together. Inasmuch, then, as men, when they have begun to turn aside from the pure word of God, continually invent various kinds of trifles, the Prophet here touches indirectly on this foolish laboriousness (<em>stultan sedulitatem </em> — foolish sedulity) when he says, <em>Take away from me the multitude of thy songs. </em>He might have simply said, “Thy songs please me not;” but he mentions their multitude, because hypocrites, as I have said, fix no limits to their outward ceremonies: and a vast heap especially follows, when once they take to themselves the liberty of devising this or that form of worship.

They afterwards take <span class="lang he-il">לא אשמע</span> “I will not hear,” by itself. But I contend not about such minute things: it is enough to know the design of the Prophet.
