<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Be ye angry, and sin not. </em>Whether or not the apostle had in his eye a part of the fourth Psalm is uncertain. The words used by him (<span class="lang el-gr">᾿Οργίζεσθε καὶ υὴ ἁμαρτάνετε</span>) occur in the Greek translation, though the word<span class="lang el-gr">ὀργίζεσθε, </span> which is translated, <em>be ye angry, </em>is considered by some to mean <em>tremble. </em><span class="cite-ref">(150)</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">רגז</span> (<em>ragaz</em>) signifies either to be agitated by anger, or, to tremble. As to the passage of the Psalm, the idea of <em>trembling </em>will be quite appropriate. “Do not choose to resemble madmen, who rush fearlessly in any direction, but let the dread of being accounted foolhardy keep you in awe.” The word sometimes signifies to <em>strive </em>or <em>quarrel</em>, as, in that instance, (<span class="bvs">Gen_45:24</span>,) “See that ye <em>fall not out </em>by the way;” and accordingly, the Psalmist adds, “Commune with your own heart, and be still,” — abstain from furious encounters. </p><p>In my opinion, Paul merely alludes to the passage with the following view. There are three faults by which we offend God in being angry. The first is, when our anger arises from slight causes, and often from no cause whatever, or at least from private injuries or offenses. The second is, when we go beyond the proper bounds, and are hurried into intemperate excesses. The third is, when our anger, which ought to have been directed against ourselves or against sins, is turned against our brethren. Most appropriately, therefore, did Paul, when he wished to describe the proper limitation of anger, employ the well-known passage<em>, Be ye angry, and sin not. </em>We comply with this injunction, if the objects of our anger are sought, not in others, but in ourselves, — if we pour out our indignation against our own faults. With respect to others, we ought to be angry, not at their persons, but at their faults; nor ought we to be excited to anger by private offenses, but by zeal for the glory of the Lord. Lastly, our anger, after a reasonable time, ought to be allowed to subside, without mixing itself with the violence of carnal passions. </p><p><em>Let not the sun go down. </em>It is scarcely possible, however, but that we shall sometimes give way to improper and sinful passion, — so strong is the tendency of the human mind to what is evil. Paul therefore suggests a second remedy, that we shall quickly suppress our anger, and not suffer it to gather strength by continuance. The first remedy was, <em>Be ye angry, and sin not; </em>but, as the great weakness of human nature renders this exceedingly difficult, the next is — not to cherish wrath too long in our minds, or allow it sufficient time to become strong. He enjoins accordingly, <em>let not the sun go down upon your wrath. </em>If at any time we happen to be angry, let us endeavor to be appeased before the sun has set. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(150)</span> “Stand in awe,” <span class="bvs">Psa_4:4</span>.
