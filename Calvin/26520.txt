As to what the Evangelist says, that <em>he escaped out of their hands, </em>this could not be accomplished in any other way than by a wonderful exertion of Divine power. This reminds us that we are not exposed to the lawless passions of wicked men, which God restrains by his bridle, whenever he thinks fit. </p></div>
