<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Not because you have been made sorry</em>. He means, that he feels no pleasure whatever in their sorrow â€” nay more, had he his choice, he would endeavor to promote equally their welfare and their joy, by the same means; but that as he could not do otherwise, their welfare was of so much importance in his view, that he rejoiced that they had been made sorry unto repentance. For there are instances of physicians, who are, indeed, in other respects good and faithful, but are at the same time harsh, and do not spare their patients. Paul declares, that he is not of such a disposition as to employ harsh cures, when not constrained by necessity. As, however, it had turned out well, that he had made trial of that kind of cure, he congratulates himself on his success. He makes use of a similar form of expression in <span class="bvs">2Co_5:4</span>, </p><p>We in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, because we are desirous not to be unclothed, but clothed upon. </p></div>
