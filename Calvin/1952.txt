<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Then said the Lord unto Moses. </em>It is probable that Moses passes over much in silence, because it is not consistent that the insolence of the people was left without even a single word of chastisement. For, although God in His extraordinary kindness gave food to these depraved and wicked men, who were unworthy of the sunlight and the common air, still He was without doubt unwilling to foster their sin by His silence, and, whilst He pardoned their ingratitude, sharply reproved their forwardness. But Moses, passing over this, proceeds to a history especially worthy of narration, how God fed this wretched people with bread from heaven, when He made the manna to fall from the clouds like dew. I call it “the bread of heaven,” with the Prophet, (<span class="bvs">Psa_78:24</span>,) who honors it with this magnificent title, and extols God’s bounty towards His people, as if they had been admitted to the tables of angels. For St. Paul calls the manna “spiritual meat,” (<span class="bvs">1Co_10:3</span>,) in another sense, viz., because it was a type of the flesh of Christ, which feeds our minds unto the hope of eternal life. The Prophet, however, makes no allusion to that mystery, but alleges in this circumstance an accusation against the people, because they not only despised the food which springs from the earth, but also were disgusted with that bread, for which they saw the heavens in a manner opened. But on this point somewhat must be hereafter repeated. God now declares that He will give them daily their allowance, as it were, that in this way He may prove the obedience of His people. Though on this latter head interpreters are not agreed; for some understand it as if God, by kindly providing food for the Israelites, would bind them to obedience by His bounty; as though He should say, “I will try whether they are altogether intractable or submissive; for nothing shall be wanting to retain them in the way of duty.” But others confine the meaning of the word to “their daily food;” for that this was the proof of their fear and reverence, that they should not desire more than was given them, but that they should he contented with their daily provision, and thus depend on the providence of God. The former sense pleases me best, and I have endeavored to explain it more clearly than it can be understood from others. There is no occasion to enter into controversy about the word “Law,” <span class="cite-ref">(171)</span> for (as we shall soon see) it is used to express the measure or rule of a pious and just life. Therefore, He says, that He will know whether they are disposed to honor Him, and to submit themselves to His command. But if any one prefer to embrace the other sense, I leave him to enjoy his own opinion. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(171)</span> “Some refer this probation or trial to that particular law and precept of gathering but a certain portion of manna every day. So <em>Vatablus, Borrha, Galas</em>. <em>, Tostat</em>. <em>, Rupert</em>. Some understand it as well of that precept, as of the other, not to gather any upon the Sabbath. — <em>Simler</em>. Some will have it taken more largely of all the precepts, and commandments touching manna, which were eight in all. — <em>Lyranus</em>. But it is better to take it in a more general sense. The Lord, as he had tried them before with crosses and adversities, so now he would prove them by His benefits, to see whether they will afterward walk in His fear, and in obedience before Him. So <em>Ferus</em>, <em>Calvin</em>, <em>Osiand</em>. , <em>Pelarg</em>. And thus by this particular benefit God would prepare them to the obedience of His law, which should be given afterwards. — <em>Oleaster</em>. ” — <em>Willet’s Hexapla in loco. </em></p></div></div>
