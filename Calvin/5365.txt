<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Neither shalt thou set thee up. </em>Hence also it more clearly appears what is the meaning and tendency of the Second Commandment. God elsewhere commands, <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> (as we have seen,) that statues <span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> should be erected on the borders of the land, on which the sum of the Law should be inscribed. At first sight this prohibition seems to be contradictory; and indeed it would be so, unless you understand “statue” to be a false image of God, in which men set Him before them in bodily form; and, therefore, it is added, that He hates such statues. But I have preferred translating <span class="cite-ref">(102)</span> the relative in the neuter gender, that the sentence might be fuller; <em>i.e., </em>that the erecting of statues is an abomination to the Lord; because in this way His glory is dishonored, when He is transfigured into a body, or when anything corporeal is mixed with His spiritual nature. </p><p><strong>(100)</strong><span class="bvs">Deu_27:2</span>. See vol. 1, p. 369. </p><p><strong>(101)</strong><em>A.V, </em>image. <em>Margin, </em>statue, or pillar. </p><p><strong>(102)</strong><em>C </em>makes the relative refer, not to the image set up, but to the act of setting it up. So also <em>V. </em>and Dathe, though the relative is plural with them. </p></div>
