<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Though I was free from all. </em><span class="lang el-gr">Εκ πάντων</span>, that is, <em>from all</em>, may be taken either in the neuter gender or in the masculine. If in the neuter, it will refer to <em>things</em>; if in the masculine, to <em>persons </em>I prefer the <em>second </em>He has as yet shown only by one particular instance how carefully he had accommodated himself to the weak. Now he subjoins a general statement, and afterwards enumerates several instances. The <em>general </em>observation is this — that while he was not under the power of any one, he lived as if he had been subject to the inclination of all, and of his own accord subjected himself to <em>the weak</em>, to whom he was under no subjection. The <em>particular </em>instances are these — that among the Gentiles he lived as if he were a Gentile, and among the Jews he acted as a Jew: that is, while among Jews he carefully observed the ceremonies of the law, he was no less careful not to give occasion of offense to the Gentiles by the observance of them. </p><p>He adds the particle <em>as</em>, to intimate that his liberty was not at all impaired on that account, for, however he might accommodate himself to men, he nevertheless remained always like himself inwardly in the sight of God. To <em>become all things </em>is to assume all appearances, as the case <em>may </em>require, or to put on different characters, according to the diversity among individuals. As to what he says respecting his <em>being without law </em>and <em>under the law</em>, you must understand it simply in reference to the ceremonial department; for the department connected with morals was common to Jews and Gentiles alike, and it would not have been allowable for Paul to gratify men to that extent. For this doctrine holds good only as to things indifferent, as has been previously remarked. </p></div>
