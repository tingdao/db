<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>The publican standing at a distance. </em>Here Christ did not intend to lay down a general rule, as if it were necessary, whenever we pray, to cast down our eyes to the ground. He merely describes the tokens of humility, which alone he recommends to his disciples. Now humility lies in not refusing to acknowledge our sins, but condemning ourselves, and thus anticipating the judgment of God; and, with the view of being reconciled to God, in making an honest confession of guilt. Such, too, is the cause of that shame which always accompanies repentance; for Christ insists chiefly on this point, that <em>the publican </em>sincerely acknowledged himself to be miserable and lost, and fled to the mercy of God. Though he is a sinner, he trusts to a free pardon, and hopes that God will be gracious to him. In a word, in order to obtain favor, he owns that he does not deserve it. And, certainly, since it is the forgiveness of sins that alone reconciles God to us, <span class="cite-ref">(332)</span> we must begin with this, if we desire that he would accept our prayers. He who acknowledges that he is guilty and convicted, and then proceeds to implore pardon, disavows all confidence in works; and Christ’s object was to show that God will not be gracious to any but those who betake themselves with trembling to his mercy alone. <span class="cite-ref">(333)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(332)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui nous rende agreables a Dieu</span>;” — “which renders us acceptable to God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(333)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui tremblans a cause d’un vray sentiment de leur pechez, recourront a sa seule misericorde</span>;” —”who, trembling on account of a true conviction of their sins, shall have recourse to his mercy alone.” </p></div></div>
