<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Render then to all what is due, etc. </em>The Apostle seems here summarily to include the particulars in which the duties of subjects towards magistrates consist, — that they are to hold them in esteem and honor, that they are to obey their edicts, laws, and judgments, — that they are to pay tributes and customs. By the word <em>fear, </em>he means obedience; by <em>customs </em>and <em>tributes, </em>not only imposts and taxes, but also other revenues. <span class="cite-ref">(407)</span></p><p>Now this passage confirms what I have already said, — that we ought to obey kings and governors, whoever they may be, not <em>because </em>we are constrained, but because it is a service <em>acceptable </em>to God; for he will have them not only to be feared, but also honored by a voluntary respect. </p><p><strong>(407)</strong> The distinction commonly made between the two words is this<span class="lang el-gr">, — φόρος, </span> “tribute,” is a tax on the person or on lands, and<span class="lang el-gr">τέλος, </span> “custom,” is what is levied on merchandise. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
