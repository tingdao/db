<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet briefly teaches us here, that so remarkable would be God’s judgement on the Babylonians that his name would thereby be celebrated through the whole world. But there is in this verse an implied contrast; for God appeared not in his own glory when the Jews were led away into exile; the temple being demolished and the whole city destroyed; and also when the whole easterly region was exposed to rapine and plunder. When therefore the Babylonians were, after the Assyrians, swallowing up all their neighbors, the glory of God did not then shine, nor was it conspicuous in the world. The Jews themselves had become mute; for their miseries had, as it were, stupefied them; their mouths were at least closed, so that they could not from the heart bless God, while he was so severely afflicting them. And then, in that manifold confusion of all things, the profane thought that all things here take place fortuitously, and that there is no divine providence. God then was at that time hid: hence the Prophet says, <em>Filled shall be the earth with the knowledge of </em>God; that is, God will again become known, when by stretching forth his hand he will execute vengeance on the Babylonians; then will the Jews, as well as other nations, acknowledge that the world is governed by God’s providence, as it had been once created by him. </p><p>We now understand the Prophet’s meaning, and why he says, that the earth would be filled with the knowledge of God’s glory; for the glory of God previously disappeared from the world, with regard to the perceptions of men; but it shone forth again, when God himself had erected his tribunal by overthrowing Babylon, and thereby proved that there is no power among men which he cannot control. We have the same sentence in <span class="bvs">Isa_11:9</span>. <span class="cite-ref">(39)</span> The Prophet there speaks indeed of the kingdom of Christ; for when Christ was openly made known to the world, the knowledge of God’s glory at the same time filled the earth; for God then appeared in his own living image. But yet our Prophet uses a proper language, when he says that the earth shall then be filled with the knowledge of God’s glory, when he should execute vengeance on the Babylonians. Hence incorrectly have some applied this to the preaching of the gospel, as though Habakkuk made a transition from the ruin of Babylon to the general judgement: this is a strained exposition. It is indeed a well-known mode of speaking, and often occurs in the Psalms, that the power, grace, and truth of God are made known through the world, when he delivers his people and restrains the ungodly. The same mode the Prophet now adopts; and he compares this fullness of knowledge to the waters of the sea, because the sea, as we know, is so deep, that there is no measuring of its waters. So Habakkuk intimates, that the glory of God would be so much known that it would not only fill the world, but in a manner overflow it: as the waters of the sea by their vast quantity cover the deep, so the glory of God would fill heaven and earth, so as to have no limits. If, at the same time, there be a wish to extend this sentence to the coming of Christ, I do not object: for we know that the grace of redemption flowed in a perpetual stream until Christ appeared in the world. But the Prophet, I have no doubt, sets forth here the greatness of God’s power in the destruction of Babylon. <span class="cite-ref">(40)</span></p><p><strong>(39)</strong> The idea is nearly the same, though not the words. The verse in Isaiah is literally this— </p><p>For fill the earth shall the knowledge of Jehovah, <LineBreak />Like the waters spreading over the sea. </p><p>The verb rendered “cover” here and in Isaiah is, [<span class="lang he-il">כסה</span> ], which means first to spread, and in the second place to cover, as the effect of spreading. It is followed here by [<span class="lang he-il">על</span> ], over, and by [<span class="lang he-il">ל</span> ], over, in Isaiah; and so spreading must be the idea included in the verb. The comparison in Isaiah is between knowledge and waters, and the earth and the sea. Hence the common version does not properly present the comparison. The verb [<span class="lang he-il">מלא</span> ], is used in a passive and active sense. See <span class="bvs">Gen_6:13</span>, and <span class="bvs">Gen_1:22</span>. This verse may be rendered in <em>Welsh </em>word for word, without changing the order in one instance:— </p><p>(lang. cy) Canys henwa y ddaear wybodaeth o Jehova, <LineBreak />Vel y dyvroedd dros y more yn ymdaenu. </p><p>“The knowledge of Jeohovah,” [<span class="lang he-il">דעה את-יהוה</span> ], is not an instance of a genitive case by juxtaposition, which is common both in Hebrew and in Welsh; for [<span class="lang he-il">את</span> ] here must be a preposition, “from,” for it is sometimes used for [<span class="lang he-il">מאת</span> ]. It is a knowledge that was to come from Jehovah, and not a knowledge of Jehovah.—<em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(40)</strong> There is no reason to doubt but that this is the meaning of the sentence here: and it is a striking instance of the variety of meaning which belongs to similar expressions, when differently connected. The glory of God is manifested by judgments as well as by mercies. In Isaiah it is “the knowledge of or from Jehovah;” here the expression is, “the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah.” By “the knowledge of Jehovah” is to be understood the revelation made by the gospel. But by “the knowledge of his glory” is meant evidently the display of his power in destroying Babylon, as power is often signified by glory.—<em>Ed. </em></p></div>
