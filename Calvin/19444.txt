<div class="comment-content"><p>Now follows the answer of Jeremiah, <em>say ye to Zedekiah, </em>etc.; he did not go to the king himself, but by way of contempt delivered the message to be borne by the messengers. The Prophet no doubt did this designedly, and through the impulse of the Holy Spirit. He did not, indeed, proudly despise his king; but it was necessary for him by his magnanimity to cast down the pride of the king, so that he might know that he had to do with the living God, whom he had very insolently treated. <em>Say ye to Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, </em>etc. He adds the words, <em>the God of Israel, </em>that Zedekiah might know that the wonderful works, in reliance on which he still thought that their condition was safe, did not belong to him and the people; as though the Prophet had said, “Though God did not help thee and thy people, he would not yet be inconsistent with himself, or depart from his covenant; but he would remain ever the God of Israel, though he destroyed thee and all thy people.” </p></div>
