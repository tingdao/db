<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>To reveal his Son to me</em>. If we read it, “to reveal <em>by me</em>, ” it will express the design of the apostleship, which is to make Christ known. And how was this to be accomplished? By preaching him among the Gentiles, which the false apostles treated as a crime. But I consider the Greek phrase<span class="lang el-gr">ἐν εμοὶ </span><span class="cite-ref">(29)</span> to be a Hebrew idiom for <em>to me</em>; for the Hebrew particle <span class="lang he-il">ב</span> (beth) is frequently redundant, as all who know that language are well aware. The meaning will therefore be, that Christ was revealed <em>to </em>Paul, not that he might alone enjoy, and silently retain in his own bosom the knowledge of Christ, but that he might preach among the Gentiles the Savior whom he had known. </p><p><em>Immediately I conferred not</em>. To <em>confer with flesh and blood</em>, is to consult with flesh and blood. So far as the meaning of these words is concerned, his intention was absolutely to have nothing to do with any human counsels. The general expression, as will presently appear from the context, includes all men, and all the prudence or wisdom which they may possess. <span class="cite-ref">(30)</span> He even makes a direct reference to the apostles, for the express purpose of exhibiting, in a stronger light, the immediate calling of God. Relying on the authority of God alone, and asking nothing more, he proceeded to discharge the duty of preaching the gospel. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(29)</span> “<span class="lang el-gr">᾿Εν ἐμοὶ</span>, that is, ‘to me;’ but yet it appears to denote something more.” — Beza. “The ancient commentators, and, of the moderns, Winer, Schott, and Scott, seem right in regarding this as a strong expression for ‘in my mind and heart.’” — Bloomfield. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(30)</span> “The expression, ‘flesh and blood,’ is used to denote men. Thus when Peter confessed to our Lord, ‘Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God,’ Jesus answered, ‘Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee.’ (<span class="bvs">Mat_16:17</span>.) That is, no man hath made this discovery; and thus it hath the same meaning in the place before us. But as the apostle speaks of his countrymen and equals in age, in the verses before, I apprehend he particularly means them, and that he intends to assure the Galatians, that, notwithstanding his former zeal for the law and the traditions of the Jews, yet that, after his extraordinary conversion, he had no longer any dependence on them, nor sought the least direction from the wisest among them.” — Chandler. </p></div></div>
