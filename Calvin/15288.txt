<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah! </em>The Psalmist again betakes himself to the mercy of God. The word <span class="lang he-il">חנן</span>, <em>chanan, </em>which I have rendered <em>have mercy, </em>is substantially the same as to <em>gratify, to do a pleasure. </em>It is as if he had said, I bring no merit of my own, but humbly pray for deliverance solely on the ground of thy mercy. When he speaks of <em>crying daily, </em>it is a proof of his hope and confidence, of which we have spoken a little before. By the word <em>cry, </em>as I have already had occasion frequently to remark, is denoted vehemence and earnestness of soul. The saints do not indeed always pray with a loud voice; but their secret sighs and groanings resound and echo upwards, and, ascending from their hearts, penetrate even into heaven. The inspired suppliant not only represents himself as crying, but as persevering in doing so, to teach us that he was not discouraged at the first or second encounter, but continued in prayer with untiring earnestness. In the following verse, he expresses more definitely the end for which he besought God to be merciful to him, which was, that his sorrow might be removed. In the second clause, he declares that there was no hypocrisy in his crying; for he <em>lifted up his soul </em>to God, which is the chief characteristic of right prayer. </p></div>
