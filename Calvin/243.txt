<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And Cush begat Nimrod</em>. It is certain that Cush was the prince of the Ethiopians. Moses relates the singular history of his son Nimrod, because he began to be eminent in an unusual degree. Moreover, I thus interpret the passage, that the condition of men was at that time moderate; so that if some excelled others, they yet did not on that account domineer, nor assume to themselves royal power; but being content with a degree of dignity, governed others by civil laws and had more of authority than power. For Justin, from Trogus Pompeius, declares this to have been the most ancient condition of the world. Now Moses says, that Nimrod, as if forgetting that he was a man, took possession of a higher post of honor. Noah was at that time yet living, and was certainly great and venerable in the eyes of all. There were also other excellent men; but such was their moderation, that they cultivated equality with their inferiors, who yielded them a spontaneous rather than a forced reverence. The ambition of Nimrod disturbed and broke through the boundaries of this reverence. Moreover, since it sufficiently appears that, in this sentence of Moses, the tyrant is branded with an eternal mark of infamy, we may hence conclude, how highly pleasing to God is a mild administration of affairs among men. And truly, whosoever remembers that he is a man, will gladly cultivate the society of others. With respect to the meaning of the terms, <span class="lang he-il">ציד</span> (<em>tsaid</em>,) properly signifies <em>hunting</em>, as the Hebrew grammarians state; yet it is often taken for <em>food </em><span class="cite-ref">(310)</span> But whether Moses says that he was robust in hunting, or in violently seizing upon prey; he metaphorically intimates that he was a furious man, and approximated to beasts rather than to men. The expression, “Before the Lord,” <span class="cite-ref">(311)</span> seems to me to declare that Nimrod attempted to raise himself above the order of men; just as proud men become transported by a vain self-confidence, that they may look down as from the clouds upon others. </p><p><em>Wherefore it is said </em><span class="cite-ref">(312)</span> Since the verb is in the future tense, it may be thus explained, Nimrod was so mighty and imperious that it would be proper to say of any powerful tyrant, that he is another Nimrod. Yet the version of Jerome is satisfactory, that thence it became a proverb concerning the powerful and the violent, that they were like Nimrod. <span class="cite-ref">(313)</span> Nor do I doubt that God intended the first author of tyranny to be transmitted to odium by every tongue. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(310)</span> “<span class="lang he-il">ציד</span>Metaphorice cibus venatione partus, aut quovis modo paratus, praeter panem.” — <em>Schindler</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(311)</span> Some translate it, “Against the Lord;” yet, perhaps, the words will hardly bear this rendering. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(312)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Qua propter dicetur,” etc., “Wherefore it shall be said” In Calvin’s text it is, “Idcirco dicitur,” “Wherefore it is said.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(313)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Ob hoc exivit proverbium, Quasi Nemrod robustus venator eoram Domino.” — <em>Vulgate </em></p></div></div>
