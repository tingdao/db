<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And he said, etc. </em>I will not stop to examine too minutely the syllables, or the few words, in which this psalm differs from the song which is recorded in the twenty-second chapter of the Second Book of Samuel. When, however, we meet with any important difference, we shall advert to it in the proper place; and we find one in the remarkable sentence with which this psalm commences, <em>I will love thee affectionately, O Jehovah, my strength, </em>which is omitted in the song in Samuel. As the Scripture does not use the verb <span class="lang he-il">רהם</span>, <em>racham, </em>for <em>to love, </em>except in the conjugation <em>pihel, </em>and as it is here put in the conjugation <em>kal, </em>some of the Jewish expositors explain it as here meaning <em>to seek mercy; </em>as if David had said, Lord, since I have so often experienced thee to be a merciful God, I will trust to and repose in thy mercies for ever. And certainly this exposition would not be unsuitable, but I am unwilling to depart from the other, which is more generally received. It is to be observed, that love to God is here laid down as constituting the principal part of true godliness; for there is no better way of serving God than to love him. No doubt, the service which we owe him is better expressed by the word <em>reverence, </em>that thus his majesty may prominently stand forth to our view in its infinite greatness. But as he requires nothing so expressly as to possess all the affections of our heart, and to have them going out towards him, so there is no sacrifice which he values more than when we are bound fast to him by the chain of a free and spontaneous love; and, on the other hand, there is nothing in which his glory shines forth more conspicuously than in his free and sovereign goodness. Moses, therefore, (<span class="bvs">Deu_10:12</span>,) when he meant to give a summary of the law, says, </p><p>“And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require <LineBreak />of thee but to love him?” </p><p>In speaking thus, David, at the same time, intended to show that his thoughts and affections were not so intently fixed upon the benefits of God as to be ungrateful to him who was the author of them, a sin which has been too common in all ages. Even at this day we see how the greater part of mankind enjoy wholly at their ease the gifts of God without paying any regard to him, or, if they think of him at all, it is only to despise him. David, to prevent himself from falling into this ingratitude, in these words makes as it were a solemn vow, Lord, as thou art my strength, I will continue united and devoted to thee by unfeigned love. </p></div>
