<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>For the foolishness of God </em>While the Lord deals with us in such a way as to seem to act foolishly, because he does not exhibit his wisdom, what appears <em>foolishness </em>surpasses in <em>wisdom </em>all the ingenuity of men. Farther, while God appears to act with weakness, in consequence of his concealing his power, that <em>weakness</em>, as it is reckoned, is <em>stronger </em>than any power of men. We must, however, always keep it in view, that there is a concession, as I have noticed a little ago. For no one can but perceive, that in strict propriety neither foolishness nor weakness can be ascribed to God, but it was necessary, by such ironical expressions, to beat down the mad presumption of the flesh, which does not scruple to rob God of all his glory. </p></div>
