<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Stand now amidst thy divinations. </em>The Prophet speaks as we are accustomed to speak to desperate men, on whom no warnings produce any good effect; “Do as thou art wont to do; in the end thou shalt be instructed by the event; thou shalt know what good the augurs and soothsayers do thee.” By the word “stand” he alludes to the custom of the augurs, who remain unmoved in one place till some sign is seen. <span class="cite-ref">(230)</span> In like manner, the astrologers mark out their divisions in the heavens, even to the minutest points. If it shall be thought preferable to translate <span class="lang he-il">חברים</span><em>(chabarim) diviners </em>instead of <em>divinations, </em>I shall not greatly object; for the meaning of the word is ambiguous. </p><p><em>If perhaps thou shalt prevail. </em>As if he had said, “Thou shalt not be able, by the aid of thy augurs, to mitigate the calamity which is about to overtake thee.” He taunts their perverse confidence on this ground, that when they shall have made every attempt, no advantage will follow. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(230)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Jusqu’ a ce que quelque oiseau soit apparu</span>.” “Till some bird is seen.” </p></div></div>
