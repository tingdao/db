<div class="comment-content"><p>The word <span class="lang he-il">פרס</span>, Pheres, is added, for the word Phersin, meaning <em>his kingdom was divided </em>among the Medes and Persians. I have no doubt that by this word God signified the dispersion of the Monarchy which was at hand. When, therefore, he says Upharsin, <em>and they shall divide, </em>it signifies the instability of the Monarchy, since he wished to destroy or utterly abolish it. But the Prophet alludes <em>very </em>appositely to the division made between the Medes and Persians; and thus his disgrace was <em>increased </em>by the Babylonians being compelled to serve many masters. This is indeed a grave and serious disgrace, when a people has obtained a wide and extensive empire, to be afterwards conquered and subjected to the yoke of a single master; but when it suffers under two masters, then the indignity is greatly <em>increased. </em>So Daniel here shews how God’s wrath was complicated in the destruction of the monarch of Babylon, since it added to the severity of their punishment, to be subdued by both Medes and Persians.

Since his grandfather had exposed him, he afterwards avenged the injury, yet, not so cruelly as to take his life,-for he desired him to retain some dignity, and hence appointed him a satrap. But his son afterwards reigned over the Medes, with the full permission of Cyrus, who next married his daughter; and thus, on account of this relationship, and through the influence of this new alliance, he wished to have him as a partner in the empire. In this sense, then, Daniel narrates the division of the Monarchy to be at hand, since the Medes and the Persians should divide it among them. It follows, — </p></div>
