<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>Let death seize upon them. </em>He now denounces the whole faction, not the nation generally, but those who had taken a prominent part in the persecution of him. In imprecating this curse he was not influenced by any bad feeling towards them, and must be understood as speaking not in his own cause but in that of God, and under the immediate guidance of his Spirit. This was no wish uttered in a moment of resentment or of reckless and ill-considered zeal, and which would justify us in launching maledictions against our enemies upon every trivial provocation. The spirit of revenge differs widely from the holy and regulated fervor with which David prays for the judgment of God against wicked men, who had already been doomed to everlasting destruction. The translation, <em>Let death condemn them, </em>is forced, and so also is another which has been suggested, <em>Let him appoint death a creditor over them. </em><span class="cite-ref">(310)</span> That which we have given is the most obvious and simple. In praying that his enemies may <em>descend alive into the grave, </em>it has been well observed, that he seems to allude to the punishment of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; though I conceive that in imprecating sudden and unexpected ruin upon them, he adverts to the proud persuasion which they cherished in their prosperity, that they would escape the stroke of death. “Lord,” as if he had said, “in the infatuation of their pride they consider themselves to be exempted from the ordinary lot of mortality, but let the earth swallow them up alive — let nothing prevent their being dragged down with all their pomp to the destruction which they deserve.” The cause which he assigns for his prayer in the latter part of the verse, is another proof that he was not influenced by any personal resentment against his enemies, but simply denounced the just judgments of God upon such as persecuted the Church. <em>Wickedness, </em>he adds, <em>is in their dwelling </em>By this he meant that it could not but dwell where they dwelt and this he expresses still more fully when he adds, <em>in the midst of them; </em>intimating, that they inwardly cherished their wickedness, so that it was their inseparable companion, and dwelt with them under the same roof. </p><p><strong>(310)</strong> This is the sense in which Horsley understands the passage. He observes, that “the image here is not sufficiently expressed by the English word <em>seize</em>, though it is not impossible that our translators might intend to allude to the seizure of a debtor. But this is rather a kindred image than the same. The precise image in the original is the exaction of payment, not the seizure of the person.” His rendering is, “Let death exalt his claim upon them.” </p></div>
