<div class="comment-content"><p>He then adds, <em>And afterwards, </em>that is, when the pestilence had in a great measure consumed them; <em>I will give, </em>or <em>deliver</em>, he says, <em>Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his servants, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzer </em>He intimates that though they might suffer with courage their wants, it, would be of no avail to them. It often happens that a siege is raised, when the obstinacy of the besieged is so great, that they overcome famine and thirst, and struggle against extreme want; for they who besiege them are led to think that they contend with furious wild beasts, and so depart from them. But God declares here that the event would be different as to the Jews, for after having been nearly consumed, they would still be delivered up into the power of their enemies. Thus he shows that, their endurance would be useless. It is indeed, a most deplorable thing, that when we have endured many grievous and distressing evils, the enemy should at length gain the <em>ascendency, </em>and possess over us the power of life and death. But God shows here that such a calamity awaited the Jews; <em>I will deliver, </em>he says, <em>Zedekiah the king of Judah, etc. </em>He doubtless intended to show how foolish their confidence was, when they thought that they were safe under the shadow of their king: “The king himself,” he says, “shall not exempt himself from danger; what then will it avail you to have a king?” And the king is expressly mentioned, that the Jews might not deceive themselves with the foolish notion, that they had a sufficient safeguard in their king. </p><p>He then adds, <em>And his servants, </em>that is, his counsellors or courtiers; for servants were those called who were the chief men and ministers of the king, “and his ministers.” There was a great deal of pride in these courtiers, and they were very hostile to the Prophets; for being blinded by their own foolish wisdom, they despised what the Prophets taught and all their warnings. For this reason the Prophet says that they would be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon. </p><p>It is further said, <em>And the people </em>The last copulative is to be taken exegetically, <em>even, </em><span class="lang he-il">ואת-הנשארים</span>, <em>veat enesharim, </em>“even the residue;” for he refers to none but the people, but intimates what the people would be, even a small number, a remnant. Then the words are to be thus rendered, “even those who shall remain in the city.” But Jerusalem, when this discourse was delivered, was in a flourishing state, and had a large number of inhabitants, he therefore shews, that after God diminished and reduced the people to a small number, there would not yet be an end to their evils, but that a worse thing would still happen to them, for their life would be put in the power of their enemies; he therefore says, <em>even those who shall remain in the city; </em>and he alludes to the last verse, for he had said that many would perish through want; nor does he refer only to famine, but, also to the sword and to the pestilence, for he says, even those who shall remain <em>from the pestilence, and from the sword, and from the famine </em>The famine, as it is usual, produced pestilence; and then when their enemies attacked the city with their warlike instruments, many must have been killed, as they could not repulse their enemies from the walls without a conflict. Then God shows that the Jews would have to contend with want, pestilence, and the sword, until they were overcome, and the city taken by the Chaldeans. </p><p>It is afterwards added, <em>into the hands of their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their life </em>This repetition is not superfluous, for God intimates what is more fully and clearly expressed by Isaiah, — that the Chaldeans would not be satisfied with plunder, that they would make no account of silver and gold, for they would burn with rage, and their object would be to shed blood. (<span class="bvs">Isa_13:17</span>.) So the meaning is here, when he mentions those who would <em>seek their life; </em>for they would be led by deadly hatred, so that their anger and cruelty would not be appeased until they destroyed them. Thus he shows that it would be a bloody victory, for the Jews would not only be led captives, because their conquerors would not think it worth their while to drag them away as worthless slaves, but their object would be wholly to destroy them. </p><p>Hence he says, <em>He will smite them </em>There is a change of number, and the reference is made to the king, and yet the whole army is included, <em>he will smite them with the mouth of the sword, he will not spare, he will not forgive, </em>(the words are synonymous,) <em>and will shew no mercy </em><span class="cite-ref">(23)</span> God thus transferred his own inexorable wrath to the Chaldeans, who were his ministers, as though he had said, “Your enemies will be implacable, they will not be turned to mercy; for I have so commanded, and I will rouse them to execute my judgment.” Nor can this be deemed strange, because God had resolved in his implacable wrath to reduce the people to nothing. For we know how great was their perverseness in their sins. </p><p>Since then they had so often rejected the mercy of God, they had in a manner closed up the door of pardon. Hence it was that God resolved that the Chaldeans should thus rage against them without any feeling of humanity. It afterwards follows, — </p><p><strong>(23)</strong> The Versions and the Targum all differ as to these three verbs, and their distinct meaning is not given by any of them. The first is to spare, the second is to relent, and the third is to feel compassion or pity. The last act, sparing, is mentioned first, then the previous one relenting, and in the third place, what occasions relenting, pity, or compassion. The same verbs occur together in <span class="bvs">Jer_13:14</span>, but in a different order, relent, spare, pity. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
