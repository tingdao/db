<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Therefore I will shake the heavens. </em>This is another figure of speech which contributes in a similar manner to heighten the picture. God cannot too earnestly urge this doctrine, not only to terrify the wicked, but to afford consolation to the godly, who are often distressed when it is well with the wicked, and when everything succeeds to their wish. David acknowledges that this happened to himself; for he says, </p><p>Surely in vain have I purified my heart,<LineBreak />and washed any hands in innocency. (<span class="bvs">Psa_73:13</span>.) </p><p>Properly, therefore, are these pictures set before our eyes, that they may plainly declare to us the destruction of the wicked. Thus it is as if Isaiah had said, “Though <em>heaven </em>and <em>earth </em>be <em>moved</em>, that the ungodly may be <em>shaken </em>and destroyed, nevertheless this will take place.” They think that they are out of all danger, and that they have struck their roots so deep that they cannot be rooted out; but he shows that they are greatly deceived, for the Lord will <em>move both heaven and earth </em>rather than not cast them down headlong. Hence it follows that, though the world present to us a thousand supports both above and below, still there will be no permanency but through the favor of God. And if this is made known in judgments of God relating to particular cases, how much more in the universal judgment, when Christ will ascend his magnificent judgment-seat, to destroy the ungodly! </p></div>
