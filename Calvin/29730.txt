<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14</strong><em>And Adam was not deceived </em>He alludes to the punishment inflicted on the woman: </p><p>“Because thou hast obeyed the voice of the serpent, thou shalt be subject to the authority of thy husband, and thy desire shall be to him.” <span class="cite-ref">(43)</span> (<span class="bvs">Gen_3:16</span>.) </p><p>Because she had given fatal advice, it was right that she should learn that she was under the power and will of another; and because she had drawn her husband aside from the command of God, it was right that she should be deprived of all liberty and placed under the yoke. Besides, the Apostle does not rest his argument entirely or absolutely on the cause of the transgression, but founds it on the sentence which was pronounced by God. </p><p>Yet it may be thought that these two statements are somewhat contradictory: that the subjection of the woman is the punishment of her transgression, and yet that it was imposed on her from the creation; for thence it will follow, that she was doomed to servitude before she sinned. I reply, there is nothing to hinder that the condition of obeying should be natural from the beginning, and that afterwards the accidental condition of serving should come into existence; so that the subjection was now less voluntary and agreeable than it had formerly been. </p><p>Again, this passage has given to some people an occasion for affirming that Adam did not fall by means of error, but that he was only overcome by the allurements of his wife. Accordingly, they think that the woman only was deceived by the wiles of the devil, to believe that she and her husband would be like the gods; But that Adam was not at all persuaded of this, but tasted the fruit in order to please his wife. But it is easy to refute this opinion; for, if Adam had not given credit to the falsehood of Satan, God would not have reproached him: </p><p>“Behold, Adam is become like one of us.” (<span class="bvs">Gen_3:22</span>.) </p><p>There are other reasons of which I say nothing; for there needs not a long refutation of an error which does not rest on any probable conjecture. By these words Paul does not mean that Adam was not entangled by the same deceitfulness of the devil, <span class="cite-ref">(44)</span> but that the cause or source of the transgression proceeded from Eve. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(43)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et ta volonte sera sujete a la sienne</span>.” — “And thy will shall be subject to his will.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(44)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il ne donna lien a aucune persuasion du diable</span>.” — “That he did not yield to any persuasion of the devil.” </p></div></div>
