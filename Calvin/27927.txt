<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Therefore be it. </em>Lest the Jews may afterward accuse him of revolting, because he forsaketh the holy stock of Abraham, and goeth to the profane Gentiles; he denounceth that which the prophets did so often testify, that the salvation whereof they were the proper, at least the principal<span class="cite-ref">(686)</span> heirs, should be translated unto strangers. Notwithstanding, whereas he saith that salvation was sent to the Gentiles, he meaneth, in the second place, to wit, after that the Jews had rejected it, as we have said before more at large ( <span class="bvs">Act_13:46</span>) Therefore, the sense is, that there is no cause why the Jews should complain if the Gentiles be admitted into the void possession after that they have forsaken it. Neither doth he make faith common to all the Gentiles in general, when he saith that they shall hear. For he had full well tried, that even many of the Gentiles did wickedly resist God, but he setteth so many of the Gentiles as believed against the unbelieving Jews, that he may provoke them unto jealousy; as it is in the Song of Moses ( <span class="bvs">Deu_32:21</span>). In the mean season, he signifieth that the doctrine which they refuse shall profit others.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(686)</span></p><p>“ Primarii,” primary. </p></div></div>
