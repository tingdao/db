<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>79.</strong><em>Let such as fear thee turn unto me. </em>In this verse, which is connected with the preceding, the Psalmist affirms, that the deliverance which he obtained would afford common instruction to all the godly. My condition, as if he had said, may, for a time, have disheartened the righteous, as well as increased the insolence of my enemies; but now, taking courage, they will turn their eyes to this joyful spectacle. Moreover, let us learn from the two marks, by which he distinguishes true believers, what is the nature of genuine godliness. He puts <em>the fear, </em>or <em>the reverence of God, </em>in the first, place; but he immediately joins to it <em>the knowledge of Divine truth, </em>to teach us that these two things are inseparably connected. The superstitious, indeed, exhibit a fear of God of a certain kind, but it is a mere show, which quickly vanishes. Besides, they weary themselves in their own inventions to no purpose; for God will take no account of any other services, but those which are performed in obedience to his commandments. True religion, then, and the worship of God, have their origin in faith â€” in the faith of what he has enjoined; so that no person can serve God aright, but he who has been taught in His school. </p></div>
