The exclamation of the multitudes, on his being cured, that <em>nothing like it had ever been seen in Israel, </em>appears to be hyperbolica1: <span class="cite-ref">(532)</span> for God had formerly revealed his glory among that people by greater miracles. But perhaps they look to the design of the miracle, as the minds of all were at that time prepared to expect the coming of the Messiah. They intended, no doubt, to exalt this instance of the grace of God, without detracting any thing from what had formerly happened. Besides, it ought to be observed, that this was not a premeditated statement, but a sudden burst of admiration. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(531)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que le diable qui le possedoit luy avoit ost, l'usage de parler</span>;” — “that the devil, who possessed him, had taken from him the use of speech.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(532)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il semble que c'est une facon de parler hyperbolique et excessive</span>;” — “it appears to be a hyperbolical and exaggerated way of speaking.” </p></div></div>
