<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>The centurion delivered the prisoners. </em>Luke doth signify that Paul had more liberty granted him than the rest; for his condition and estate was peculiar. For he was suffered to dwell in an house by himself, having one keeper with him, whereas the rest were shut up in the common prison. For the general captain<span class="cite-ref">(670)</span> knew by Festus’ report that Paul was guiltless; and the centurion, as it is likely, did faithfully rehearse such things as might serve to bring him into favor. Notwithstanding, let us know that God did govern<span class="cite-ref">(671)</span> from heaven the bonds of his servant; not only that he might ease him of his trouble, but that the faithful might have freer access unto him. For he would not have the treasure of his faith shut up in prison, but he would have it laid open, that it might enrich many far and wide. And yet Paul was not so at liberty, but that he did always carry a chain. Luke calleth the general captain <span class="lang el-gr">στρατοπεδαρχης</span>, who was appointed over the army which kept the city, as histories make mention.<span class="cite-ref">(672)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(670)</span></p><p>“ Praefectus,” the praefect. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(671)</span></p><p>“ Moderatum,” temper. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(672)</span></p><p>“Praefectum praetorio cujus illud officium fuisse ex historiis satis notum est ,” praefect of the praetorium, to whom it is well known from history that office belonged. </p></div></div>
