<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>Of a truth, it was not an enemy that cast reproach upon me </em>He informs us of one circumstance which added bitterness to the injuries under which he suffered, that they came from the hands not only of his professed enemies, but of such as pretended to be his friends. Those mistake the meaning of <span class="lang he-il">נשא</span>,<em>nasa, </em>who interpret it as if David had said, that he <em>could patiently have borne </em>the reproach of an open enemy. What he says is, that had an open enemy reproached him, he could then have <em>met it, </em>as one meets and parries off a blow which is aimed at him. Against a known foe we are on our watch, but the unsuspected stroke of a friend takes us by surprise. By adopting this view of the word, we shall find that the repetition in the verse is more perfect; reading in the one member, <em>I would have met it; </em>and in the other, <em>I would have hidden myself </em>When he speaks of the enemy <em>magnifying himself against him, </em>he does not simply mean that he used insulting language, but in general, that he summoned all his violence to overthrow him. The sum of David’s complaint in this passage is, that he was assailed by treachery of that secret description which rendered self-defense impossible. With regard to the individual whom he had particularly in view, when he preferred this accusation, I do not imagine that it was Ahitophel, for the psalm itself would not appear to have been written upon the persecution of Absalom. Whether it may have been some notorious traitor in the city of Keilah, it is impossible to determine. Not the least probable conjecture is, that it may have been some great man at court, whose intimacy with David was generally known. Possibly he may have had more than one in his eye, courtiers who had sacrificed former friendship to a desire of rising in the royal favor, and lent their influence to destroy him. These, with some more eminent person at their head, may be the parties aimed at. At any rate, we are taught by the experience of David, as here represented to us, that we must expect in this world to meet with the secret treachery of friends, as well as with undisguised persecution. Satan has assaulted the Church with sword and open war, but he has also raised up domestic enemies to injure it with the more secret weapons of stratagem and fraud. This is a species of foe which, as Bernard expresses it, we can neither fly from nor put to flight. Whoever might be the individual referred to, David calls him a man of <em>his own order, </em>for so the term <span class="lang he-il">ערך</span>,<em>erach, </em>should, in my opinion, be translated, and not as some, <em>his equal in estimation, </em>or as by others, a man <em>esteemed by him to be his second self. </em><span class="cite-ref">(308)</span> He complains of the violation of the common bond of fraternity, as none needs to be told that there are various bonds, whether of relationship, profession, or office, which ought to be respected and held sacred. He makes mention also of his having been his <em>leader </em>and commander, of their having enjoyed sweet interchange of secret counsel together, and of their having frequented the religious assemblies in company, — all of which he adverts to as circumstances which lent an additional aggravation to his treachery. The term <span class="lang he-il">רגש</span><span class="cite-ref">(309)</span>, <em>regesh, </em>does not seem to signify here <em>the stir attending the convention of an assembly, </em>but rather <em>company, </em>intimating, that he was his close companion when they went to the house of God. Thus he would inform us, that he was betrayed by one who had been his intimate associate, and to whom he had looked up as a leader, in matters not only secular but religious. We are taught by the Spirit to reverence all the natural ties which bind us together in society. Besides the common and universal one of humanity, there are others of a more sacred kind, by which we should feel ourselves attached to men in proportion as they are more nearly connected with us than others by neighborhood, relationship, or professional calling, the more as we know that such connections are not the result of chance, but of providential design and arrangement. Need I say that the bond of religious fellowship is the most sacred of all? </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(308)</span> This is the sense put upon the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">ערך</span>, <em>erach</em>, by the LXX., who read, “<span class="lang el-gr">Σὺ δὲ ἄνθρωπε ἰσφ́ψυχε</span>,” “But thou, a man whom I love and esteem as I do my own soul;” the word <span class="lang el-gr">ἰσόψυχος</span> signifying <span class="lang el-gr">ἱσος ἐμὢψυχἦ</span>, <em>equal to my soul </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(309)</span> “Properly, a noisy crowd; hence, genr. <em>crowd</em>, <em>multitude</em>. ” — <em>Gesenius </em>It is from <span class="lang he-il">רגש</span>, <em>ragash</em>, <em>to rage</em>, <em>to make a noise</em>, <em>tumult</em>; of nations, <span class="bvs">Psa_2:1</span>. </p></div></div>
