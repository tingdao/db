<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Near the place where they had eaten bread. </em>The meaning of the words is doubtful; for they may be explained, either that Tiberias was <em>near the place where </em>Christ had fed them with five loaves, or that the ships reached the shore which was near and below that place. I approve more highly of the latter exposition; for Bethsaida, near which Luke states that the miracle was performed, is half-way between Tiberias and Capernaum. Accordingly, when ships came down from that place, which was farther up the lake, they sailed along that shore on which the multitude were standing; and there can be no doubt that they came to land for the purpose of taking in passengers. </p><p><em>After that the Lord had given thanks. </em>When John again mentions that Christ <em>gave thanks</em>, it is not a superfluous repetition; for he means that Christ obtained by prayer that those few loaves were sufficient for feeding so many people; and as we are cold and indolent in prayer, he presses upon us the same thing a second time. </p></div>
