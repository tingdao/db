<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And he that offered his offering the first day </em>The oracular declaration which God made by the mouth of Jacob is well known. “The scepter shall not depart from Judah,” etc. (<span class="bvs">Gen_49:10</span>.) Non, although the time had not yet arrived when the truth of this prophecy should be manifested by its fulfillment, still it was brought to pass by the admirable counsel of God that certain marks of supremacy should exist in the tribe of Judah; and, by general consent, if not dominion, at least the chief dignity, was always lodged in it. The assignment of the first day to Nahshon was, therefore,a presage of that future kingdom which was at length set up in the person of David. If any should allege the absurdity that the tribe of Reuben, who was the first-born, should be kept back till the fourth day, I reply that the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar were ranked under the banner of Judah; since it will appear in chapter 10. <span class="cite-ref">(403)</span> that the twelve tribes were divided into four divisions of three. Thus it was more honorable for the tribe of Reuben to have the fourth day, so as to have the two tribes over which it presided attached to it. But the fathers of the two tribes, which God placed under the banner of Judah, were the two youngest sons of Leah, who followed next after Judah, her fourth son. We see, therefore, that the kingdom was thus obscurely shadowed forth, from which salvation was to be hoped for by the whole people: in order that they might be the more attentive to the promise given them; although this indication of it had but little effect on their sluggish minds. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(403)</span> “Que la compagnie a suyvi son chef: car les douze lignees,” etc.; that the company followed its chief; for the twelve tribes, <em>etc. </em>— <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
