<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>I am not conscious to myself of anything faulty. </em>Let us observe that Paul speaks here not of his whole life, but simply of the office of apostleship. For if he had been altogether unconscious to himself of anything wrong, <span class="cite-ref">(222)</span> that would have been a groundless complaint which he makes in <span class="bvs">Rom_7:15</span>, where he laments that <em>the evil which he would not</em>, <em>that he does</em>, and that he is by sin kept back from giving himself up entirely to God. Paul, therefore, felt <em>sin dwelling in him</em>, and confessed it; but as to his apostleship, (which is the subject that is here treated of,) he had conducted himself with so much integrity and fidelity, that his conscience did not accuse him as to anything. This is a protestation of no common character, and of such a nature as clearly shows the piety and sanctity of his breast; <span class="cite-ref">(223)</span> and yet he says that <em>he is not thereby justified, </em>that is, pure, and altogether free from guilt in the sight of God. Why? Assuredly, because God sees much more distinctly than we; and hence, what appears to us cleanest, is filthy in his eyes. Here we have a beautiful and singularly profitable admonition, not to measure the strictness of God’s judgment by our own opinion; for we are dim-sighted, but God is preeminently discerning. We think of ourselves too indulgently, but God is a judge of the utmost strictness. Hence the truth of what Solomon says — </p><p>“Every man’s ways appear right his own eyes, but the Lord pondereth the hearts.” (<span class="bvs">Pro_21:2</span>.) </p><p>Papists abuse this passage for the purpose of shaking the assurance of faith, and truly, I confess, that if their doctrine were admitted, we could do nothing but tremble in wretchedness during our whole life. For what tranquillity could our minds enjoy if it were to be determined from our works whether we are well-pleasing to God? I confess, therefore, that from the main foundation of Papists there follows nothing but continual disquietude for consciences; and, accordingly, we teach that we must have recourse to the free promise of mercy, which is offered to us in Christ, that we may be fully assured that we are accounted righteous by God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(222)</span> “Si nihil prorsus sibi consciret;” — our author most probably had in his eye a well-known passage in Horace, (Ep.
