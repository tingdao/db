<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>The three branches are three days</em>. Joseph does not here offer what he thought to be probable, like some ambiguous conjecturer; but asserts, by the revelation of the Spirit, the meaning of the dream. For why does he say, that by the three branches, three <em>days </em>rather than <em>years </em>are signified, unless because the Spirit of God had suggested it? Joseph, therefore, proceeds, by a special impulse above nature, to expound the dream; and by immediately commending himself to the butler, as if he was already restored, shows how certain and indubitable was the truth of his interpretation: as if he had said, “Be convinced that what thou hast heard of me has come from God.” Where also he shows how honorably he thinks of the oracles of God, seeing that he pronounces concerning the future effect with as much confidence as if it had already taken place. But it may be deemed absurd, that Joseph asks for a reward of his prophecy. I answer, that he did not speak as one who would set the gift of God to sale: but it came into his mind, that a method of deliverance was now set before him by God, which it was not lawful for him to reject. Indeed, I do not doubt that a hope of better fortune had been divinely imparted to him. For God, who, even from his childhood, had twice promised him dominion, did not leave him, amidst so many straits, entirely destitute of all consolation. Now this opportunity of seeking deliverance was offered to him by none but God. Wherefore, it is not surprising that Joseph should thus make use of it. With respect to the expression, <em>Lift up thine head; </em>it signifies to raise any one from a low and contemptible condition, to one of some reputation. Therefore, “<em>Pharaoh will lift up thine head,” </em>means, he will bring thee forth from the darkness of the prisons, or he will raise thee who art fallen, and restore thee to thy former rank. For I take the word to mean simply <em>place </em>or <em>rank</em>, and not <em>basis </em><span class="cite-ref">(151)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(151)</span>Pro loco et ordine simpliciter accipio, non autem pro basi The passage needs explanation. The word <span class="lang he-il">ראשך</span>, rendered “thy head,” might be rendered “thy nail,” and some writers have supposed that it should be so translated in this place. The reason given for such a rendering arises from a supposed custom among eastern monarchs of having a large white tablet, on which the name of each officer of state was inscribed, and a nail was placed in a hole opposite the name. When the officer offended, the nail was removed from its place, that is, from its basis or foundation, and the man’s distinction and character were lost. — <em>Junis </em>in Poli Synopsin. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
