<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Mourning over the breasts. </em>This verse is explained in various ways. Some understand it to mean simply, that there will be so great a scarcity of provisions, that women will lose their milk, and thus the children will “mourn over dry breasts;” which we see sometimes happen, when a very great scarcity of provisions occasions leanness. But the more generally received and more appropriate interpretation is, to view the word “breasts” as figuratively denoting fields and vineyards, as the Prophet himself declares; for they are justly compared to the breasts of mothers, because, by deriving nourishment from them, we suck the milk or blood of the earth. He therefore means that there will be a want of food and nourishment, because the Lord will curse the earth, so that it shall yield no fruits. Thus shall men sigh over that scarcity, as if over their mother’s “breasts,” from which they formerly received delicious nourishment. This appears to me to be a more natural meaning, and to agree best with the context; for it serves to explain what afterwards follows, about “rich fields and the fruitful vine.” <span class="cite-ref">(340)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(340)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
