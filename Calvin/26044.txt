<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>52.</strong><em>And having worshipped him, they returned. </em>By the word <em>worship, </em>Luke means, first, that the apostles were relieved from all doubt, because at that time the majesty of Christ shone on all sides, so that there was no longer any room for doubting of his resurrection; and, secondly, that for the same reason they began to honor him with greater reverence than when they enjoyed his society on earth. For the <em>worship </em>which is here mentioned was rendered to him not only as Master or Prophet, nor even as the Messiah, whose character had been but half known, but as the King of glory and the Judge of the world. Now as Luke intended to give a longer narrative, he only states briefly what the apostles did during ten days. The amount of what is said is, that through <em>the fervor of their joy </em>they broke out openly into the <em>praises of God, and were continually in the temple; </em>not that they remained there by day and by night, but that they attended the public assemblies, and were present at the ordinary and stated hours to <em>render thanksgiving to </em>God. This <em>joy </em>is contrasted with the fear which formerly kept them retired and concealed at home. </p></div>
