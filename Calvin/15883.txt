<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Thou hast sorely thrust at me. </em>He either now changes the person, or directs his discourse to Saul, his principal enemy. In the person of one, he sets at defiance all his enemies together. In saying that he <em>had been thrust at, </em>he admits that he did not withstand the onset by his own bravery, as those who are powerful enough to encounter opposition, sustain the assaults of their enemies without flinching. The power of God is more illustriously displayed in raising him up even from ruin itself. </p><p>In the subsequent verse he draws the conclusion that God is <em>his strength and song. </em>By the former adjunct he candidly acknowledges his weakness, and ascribes his safety exclusively to God. And having admitted that his strength was in God alone, because he was sustained by his power, immediately he adds, that God is <em>his praise </em>or <em>his song, </em>which must be understood passively. “In myself there was no ground for boasting, to God belongs entirely all the praise of my safety.” The last clause of the verse, in which he says that <em>God was his salvation, </em>refers to the same subject. </p></div>
