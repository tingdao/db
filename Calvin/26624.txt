<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>44.</strong><em>And Jesus cried. </em>The object of Christ, in this statement, is to encourage his followers to a proper and unshaken steadfastness of faith; but it contains also an implied reproof, by which he intended to correct that perverse fear. The <em>cry </em>is expressive of vehemence; for it is not a simple doctrine, but an exhortation intended to excite them more powerfully. The statement amounts to this, that faith in Christ does not rely on any mortal man, but on God; for it finds in Christ nothing but what is divine, or rather, it beholds God in his face. Hence he infers, that it is foolish and unreasonable for faith to be wavering or doubtful; for it is impossible to offer a greater insult to God, than not to rely on his truth. Who is it then that has duly profited by the Gospel? It is he who, relying or this confidence, that he does not believe men but God, quietly and steadily contends against all the machinations of Satan. If, then, we would render to God the honor due to him, we must learn to remain firm in faith, not only though the world were shaken, but even though Satan should disturb and overturn all that is under heaven. </p><p><em>He that believeth on me believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. Believers </em>are said<em>not to believe on Christ</em>, when they do not fix their whole attention on his human countenance. Comparing himself with the Father, he bids us look at the power of God; for the weakness of the flesh has no firmness in </p><p>itself. When we shall, afterwards, find him exhorting the disciples to <em>believe on him</em>, it will be in a different sense; for, in that passage, God is not contrasted with man, but Christ is brought forward with all his gifts and graces <span class="cite-ref">(33)</span> which ought to be sufficient for upholding our faith. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(33)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Avec toutes ses graces et dons</span>.” </p></div></div>
