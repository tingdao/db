<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet, after having removed the obstacle which he saw hindered the Jews from reverently receiving the truth of God, now speaks more sharply, and performs the office of a herald in denouncing the vengeance which was at hand: <em>Behold, </em>he says, <em>come shall the days, </em>in which <em>I will visit all the uncircumcised in uncircumcision </em></p><p>This passage admits of two meanings. Some interpreters take as distinct these two words, <span class="lang he-il">מול</span><em>mul, </em>the circumcised, <span class="lang he-il">בערלה</span>, <em>beorle, </em>in uncircumcision; as though Jeremiah had said, “I will visit the Jews, who are circumcised, as well as the heathen nations, who are uncircumcised,” Others read them jointly, — that God threatens vengeance on the Jews and Gentiles, because they were circumcised, and still retained uncircumcision. The passage may however be thus suitably explained, — that there was a mixture, which corrupted the sacredness of circumcision, and made it like the uncircumcision of the Gentiles; as though it were thus expressed, “I will visit the circumcised with the uncircumcision,” that is, promiscuously and without any difference, as we say in our language, <em>Pele mele. </em>For it follows afterwards, that <em>all were uncircumcised in heart; </em>that is, all the Jews. We hence see that the Prophet makes circumcision and uncireumcision the same, and that he intended to render profane the sacred symbol of adoption;but he had reference to the Jews, who, being degenerated, thus adulterated God’s covenant, and at the same time violated circumcision, so that in differed nothing from <em>uncircumcision. </em>I therefore think, that the Jews are classed with the Gentiles, so that he ascribes even to them uncircumcision: <em>I will </em>then <em>visit all the circumcised with the uncircumcision; </em>that is, the <em>circumcision </em>of each is vain, and is like uncircumcision. </p></div>
