We are not, it is true, bound by a constant necessity to the use of such forms of expression, but it is the better way to accustom ourselves carefully to them, that we may exercise our minds from time to time in this consideration — that all our plans must be in subjection to the will of God. </p><p><em>And I will know not the speech </em>By <em>speech </em>you must understand that prating in which the false apostles delighted themselves, for they excelled in a kind of dexterity and gracefulness of speech, while they were destitute of the zeal and efficacy of the Spirit. By the term <em>power</em>, he means that spiritual efficacy, with which those are endowed who dispense the word of the Lord with earnestness. <span class="cite-ref">(264)</span> The meaning, therefore, is: “I shall see whether they have so much occasion for being puffed up; and I shall not judge of them by their mere outward talkativeness, in which they place the sum-total <span class="cite-ref">(265)</span> of their glory, and on the ground of which they claim for themselves every honor. If they wish to have any honor from me, they must bring forward that <em>power </em>which distinguishes the true servants of Christ from the merely pretended: otherwise I shall despise them, with all their show. It is to no purpose, therefore, that they confide in their eloquence, for I shall reckon it nothing better than smoke.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(264)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’vn bon zele, et pure affection</span>;” — “With a right zeal and a pure affection.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(265)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Proram et puppim</span>;” — “Prow and stern.” </p></div></div>
