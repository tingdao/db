<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>For I believe God. </em>Paul telleth them again whence he had such boldness, that he affirmeth that though they be amidst infinite gulfs of the sea, yet shall they all come safe to the haven, namely, because God had promised it should be so; in which words the nature of faith is expressed, when there is a mutual relation made between it and the Word of God, that it may strengthen men’s minds against the assaults of temptations. And he doth not only exhort the mariners, by his own example, to believe, but doth, as it were, take upon him the office of a promiser,<span class="cite-ref">(645)</span> that he may win credit to the oracle. That which followeth immediately touching the isle is a latter sign, whereby it may more plainly appear after the end of the matter, that this their sailing was not uncertain, otherwise it had been to no end for the mariners to know how they should escape. Therefore, we see how God doth give that safety which he promised, a mark that it may not seem to come by chance. Notwithstanding, we must note, that God kept them still in some doubt, partly that he may exercise the faith of his servant, partly that they may all know that Paul learned that of the Holy Ghost, which he could not as yet comprehend by man’s reason.<span class="cite-ref">(646)</span> Notwithstanding, Luke teacheth in the text itself, that he was not believed for all this. For, seeing the mariners thought that there began some country<span class="cite-ref">(647)</span> to appear unto them, it did not agree with the promise made touching their arriving in an isle. Therefore, we see how that they were scarce enforced, even by experience, to think that he spake the truth.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(645)</span></p><p>“ Sponsoris,” sponsor or cautioner. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(646)</span></p><p>“ Quod humano sensu nondum comprehendi poterat,” which could not yet be comprehended by human sense. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(647)</span></p><p>“ Aliquam regionem mediterraneam,” some mainland. </p></div></div>
