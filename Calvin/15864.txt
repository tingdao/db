<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his meek ones. </em>He goes on now to the general doctrine of God’s providential care for the godly, in that he renders them assistance in time of need; their lives being precious in his sight. With this shield he desires to defend himself from the terrors of death, which often pressed upon him, by which he imagined he would instantly be swallowed up. When we are in danger and God apparently overlooks us, we then consider ourselves to be contemned as poor slaves, and that our life is regarded as a thing of nought. And we are aware that when the wicked perceive that we have no protection, they wax the more bold against us, as if God took no notice either of our life or death. In opposition to their erroneous doctrine, David introduces this sentiment, that God does not hold his servants in so little estimation as to expose them to death casually. <span class="cite-ref">(384)</span> We may indeed for a time be subjected to all the vicissitudes of fortune and of the world; we will nevertheless always have this consolation, that God will, eventually, openly manifest how dear our souls are to him. In these times, when innocent blood is shed, and the wicked contemners of God furiously exalt themselves, as if exulting over a vanquished God, let us hold fast by this doctrine, that the death of the faithful, which is so worthless, nay, even ignominious in the sight of men, is so valuable in God’s sight, that, even after their death, he stretches out his hand towards them, and by dreadful examples demonstrates how he holds in abhorrence the cruelty of those who unjustly persecute the good and simple. If he put their tears in a bottle, how will he permit their blood to perish? <span class="bvs">Psa_56:8</span> At his own time he will accomplish the prediction of Isaiah, “that the earth shall disclose her blood,” <span class="bvs">Isa_26:21</span>. To leave room for the grace of God, let us put on the spirit of meekness, even as the prophet, in designating the faithful <em>meek ones, </em>calls upon them to submit their necks quietly to bear the burden of the cross, that in their patience they may possess their souls, <span class="bvs">Luk_21:19</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(384)</span> “For their death to be precious is, in effect, no more than that it is, so considered, rated at so high a price by God, as that he will not easily grant it to any one that most desires it of him. Absalom here hostilely pursued David and desired his death, he would have been highly gratified with it, taking it for the greatest boon that could have befallen him: but God would not thus gratify him; nor will he grant this desire easily to the enemies of godly men, especially of those that commit themselves to his keeping, as David here did.” — <em>Hammond. </em></p></div></div>
