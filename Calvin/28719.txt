<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Now I make known to you. </em>He now enters on another subject — the resurrection — the belief of which among the Corinthians had been shaken by some wicked persons. It is uncertain, however, whether they doubted merely as to the ultimate resurrection of the body, or as to the immortality of the soul also. It is abundantly well known, that there were a variety of errors as to this point. Some philosophers contended that souls are immortal. As to the resurrection of the body, it never entered into the mind of any one of them. The Sadducees, however, had grosser views; for they thought of nothing but the present life; nay more, they thought that the soul of man was a breath of wind without substance. It is not, therefore, altogether certain (as I have already said) whether the Corinthians had at this time gone to such a height of madness, as to cast off all expectation of a future life, or whether they merely denied the resurrection of the body; for the arguments which Paul makes use of seem to imply, that they were altogether bewitched with the mad dream of the Sadducees. </p><p>For example, when he says, </p><p>Of what advantage is it to be baptized for the dead?<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_15:29</span>.) </p><p>Were it not better to eat and to drink? <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_15:32</span>.) </p><p>Why are we in peril every hour? (<span class="bvs">1Co_15:30</span>,) </p><p>and the like, it might very readily be replied, in accordance with the views of the philosophers, “Because after death the soul survives the body.” Hence some apply the whole of Paul’s reasoning contained in this chapter to the immortality of the soul. For my part, while I leave undetermined what the error of the Corinthians was, yet I cannot bring myself to view Paul’s words as referring to anything else than the resurrection of the body. Let it, therefore be regarded as a settled point, that it is of this exclusively that he treats in this chapter. And what if the impiety of Hymeneus and Philetus had extended thus far, <span class="cite-ref">(2)</span> who said that <em>the resurrection was already past, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Ti_2:18</span>,) and that there would be nothing more of it? Similar to these, there are at the present day some madmen, or rather devils, <span class="cite-ref">(3)</span> who call themselves Libertines. <span class="cite-ref">(4)</span> To me, however, the following conjecture appears more probable — that they were carried away by some delusion, <span class="cite-ref">(5)</span> which took away from them the hope of a future resurrection, just as those in the present day, by imagining an allegorical resurrection, <span class="cite-ref">(6)</span> take away from us the true resurrection that is promised to us. </p><p>However this may be, it is truly a dreadful case, and next to a prodigy, that those who had been instructed by so distinguished a master, should have been capable of falling so quickly <span class="cite-ref">(7)</span> into errors of so gross a nature. But what is there that is surprising in this, when in the Israelitish Church the Sadducees had the audacity to declare openly that man differs nothing from a brute, in so far as concerns the essence of the soul, and has no enjoyment but what is common to him with the beasts? Let us observe, however, that blindness of this kind is a just judgment from God, so that those who do not rest satisfied with the truth of God, are tossed hither and thither by the delusions of Satan. </p><p>It is asked, however, why it is that he has left off or deferred to the close of the Epistle, what should properly have had the precedence of everything else? Some reply, that this was done for the purpose of impressing it more deeply upon the memory. I am rather of opinion that Paul did not wish to introduce a subject of such importance, until he had asserted his authority, which had been considerably lessened among the Corinthians, and until he had, by repressing their pride, prepared them for listening to him with docility. </p><p><em>I make known to you. </em>To <em>make known </em>here does not mean to teach what was previously unknown to them, but to recall to their recollection what they had heard previously. “Call to your recollection, along with me, that gospel which you had learned, before you were led aside from the right course.” He calls the doctrine of the resurrection <em>the gospel, </em>that they may not imagine that any one is at liberty to form any opinion that he chooses on this point, as on other questions, which bring with them no injury to salvation. </p><p>When he adds, <em>which I preached to you, </em>he amplifies what he had said: <em>“If </em>you acknowledge me as an apostle, I have assuredly taught you so.” There is another amplification in the words — <em>which also ye have received, </em>for if they now allow themselves to be persuaded of the contrary, they will be chargeable with fickleness. A <em>third </em>amplification is to this effect, that they had hitherto continued in that belief with a firm and steady resolution, which is somewhat more than that they had once believed. But the most important thing of all is, that he declares that their salvation is involved in this, for it follows from this, that, if the resurrection is taken away, they have no religion left them, no assurance of faith, and in short, have no faith remaining. Others understand in another sense the word <em>stand, </em>as meaning that they are <em>upheld; </em>but the interpretation that I have given is a more correct one. <span class="cite-ref">(8)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(2)</span><em>“ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Iusques a Corinthe</span><em>;” </em>— <em>“ </em>As far as Corinth.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(3)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Possedez d’autres diables</span>;” — “Possessed by other devils.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(4)</span> “The <em>Libertines </em>of Geneva were rather a cabal of rakes than a set of fanatics; for they made no pretense to any religious system, but only pleaded for the liberty of leading voluptuous and immoral lives.
