<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>42.</strong><em>The queen of the south. </em>As Ethiopia lies in a southerly direction from Judea, I willingly concur with Josephus and other writers, who assert that she was the queen of Ethiopia. In sacred history she is called <em>the queen of Sheba, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Ch_9:1</span>.) We must not suppose this <em>Sheba </em>to be the country of <em>Saba, </em>which rather lay toward the east, but a town situated in Meroe, an island on the Nile, which was the metropolis of the kingdom. Here, too, we must attend to the points of contrast. A woman who had not been at all educated in the school of God, was induced, by the desire of instruction, to come from a distant region to Solomon, an earthly king; while the Jews, who had been instructed in the divine law, reject their highest and only teacher, the Prince of all the prophets. The word <em>condemn </em>relates not to the persons, but to the fact itself, and the example which it yields. </p></div>
