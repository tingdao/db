The application, therefore, is designed with the view of leading the Corinthians to perceive, that it was not without good reason that Paul had made mention of harmony. For he shows that they had not merely turned aside from a holy unity, <span class="cite-ref">(58)</span> but had even fallen into contentions, which are worse <span class="cite-ref">(59)</span> than jarrings of sentiment. And that he may not be charged with believing too readily what was said, <span class="cite-ref">(60)</span> as though he lightly lent his ear to false accusations, he speaks with commendation of his informants, who must have been in the highest esteem, as he did not hesitate to adduce them as competent witnesses against an entire Church. It is not indeed altogether certain, whether <em>Chloe </em>is the name of a place or of a woman, but to me it appears more probable that it is the name of a woman. <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> I am of opinion, therefore, that it was a well-regulated household that acquainted Paul with the distempered condition of the Corinthian Church, being desirous that it might be remedied by him. The idea entertained by many, in accordance with Chrysostom’s view, that he refrained from mentioning names, lest he should bring odium upon them, appears to me to be absurd. For he does not say that some of the household had reported this to him, but, on the contrary, makes mention of them all, and there is no doubt that they would willingly have allowed their names to be made use of. Farther, that he might not exasperate their minds by undue severity, he has modified the reproof by an engaging form of address; not as though he would make light of the distemper, but with the view of bringing them to a more teachable spirit, for perceiving the severity of the malady. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(58)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La sancte union qui doit estre entre les Chrestiens</span>;” — “That holy unity which ought to be among Christians.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(59)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Bien plus dangereuses</span>;” — “Much more dangerous.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(60)</span> It is remarked by Beza that the verb here employed, <span class="lang el-gr">δηλοω</span>, (to <em>declare</em>,)has a stronger signification than <span class="lang el-gr">σημαινω</span> (to <em>intimate</em>,) just as there is a difference of meaning between the Latin words <em>declarare </em> (to <em>declare</em>) and <em>significare </em> (to <em>intimate</em>,) an example of which is furnished in a letter of Cicero to Lucretius, “tibi non <em>significandum </em>solum, sed etiam <em>declarandum </em>arbitror, nihil mihi esse potuisse tuis literis gratius;” “I think it ought to be not merely <em>intimated </em>to you but <em>declared</em>, that nothing could be more agreeable to me than your letters.” The emphatic word <span class="lang el-gr">εδηλωθν</span> (it has been <em>declared</em>,) appears to have been made use of by the Apostle to convey more fully to the mind of the Corhlthians, that he had not hastily given heed to a mere <em>report</em>. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(61)</span> Some have thought that by <span class="lang el-gr">τῶς Χλόης</span>,(those of Chloe,) the Apostle means persons who were in a <em>flourishing </em>condition in religion; from <span class="lang el-gr">χλόη</span>, green herbage, (Herodotus, 4:34, Euripides, Hipp. 1124.) One writer supposes Paul to mean <em>seniores</em>, (elders,) deriving the word <span class="lang el-gr">χλόη </span> from <span class="lang he-il">כלח</span>, old age. These conjectures, however, are manifestly more ingenious than solid. It is certain that the name <span class="lang el-gr">Χλόν</span> (Chloe,) was frequent among the Greeks as the name of a female.
