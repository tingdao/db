When we become aware, in good earnest, of the presence of <em>God, </em>we cannot think of it apart from its effects. <span class="cite-ref">(25)</span> Accordingly, as we are all amenable to his tribunal, fear gives rise to trembling, until God manifests himself as a Father. The holy virgin saw in her own nation such a mass of crimes, that she had good reason for dreading heavier punishments. To remove this fear, the angel declares that he has come to certify and announce an inestimable blessing. The Hebrew idiom, Thou <em>hast found favor, </em>is used by Luke instead of, “God has been merciful to thee:” for a person is said to <em>find favor, </em>not when he has sought it, but when it has been freely offered to him. Instances of this are so well known, that it would be of no use to quote them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(25)</span> “Neque otiosam imaginari licet.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car nous ne pouvons point apprehender à bon escient la presence de Dieu, sinon avec ses effects</span>.” </p></div></div>
