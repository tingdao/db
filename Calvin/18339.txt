<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Now come, give a hostage. </em><span class="cite-ref">(33)</span> He concludes that there will be nothing better for Hezekiah than to lay aside the intention of carrying on war, to surrender himself, and to promise constant obedience to the king of Assyria. To persuade him the more, Rabshakeh again reproaches him with his poverty. “If I shall give thee two thousand horses, thou wilt not find among all thy people men to ride on them. What then is thy strength; or with what confidence dost thou dare to oppose my king?” He does not offer him horses for the sake of respect or of kindness, but in order to terrify and shake still more the heart of Hezekiah. The future tense ought therefore to be explained by the subjunctive mood, “<em>Although I give </em>thee two thousand horses, yet thou wilt not find an equal number of riders.” I am aware of what is alleged by other commentators; but whoever examines the matter fully will quickly perceive that this is ironical language. <span class="cite-ref">(34)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(33)</span> “Now therefore give pledges <em>or hostages.” </em>— Eng.

These words do not refer to the small number of men, but to the very small number of Jews who were skilled in horsemanship; for after Jotham the kings of Judea did not maintain any cavalry, and hence we have already seen (<span class="bvs">Isa_30:0</span>.) that a part of the Jews sought cavalry from the Egyptians.” — <em>Rosenmuller. </em></p></div></div>
