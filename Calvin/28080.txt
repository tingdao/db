<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Let not sin then</em>, <em>etc. </em>He now begins with exhortation, which naturally arises from the doctrine which he had delivered respecting our fellowship with Christ. Though sin dwells in us, it is inconsistent that it should be so vigorous as to exercise its reigning power; for the power of sanctification ought to be superior to it, so that our life may testify that we are really the members of Christ. I have already reminded you that the word <em>body </em>is not to be taken for flesh, and skin, and bones, but, so to speak, for the whole of what man is. <span class="cite-ref">(191)</span> This may undoubtedly be inferred from the passage; for the other clause, which he immediately subjoins respecting the members of the body, includes the soul also: and thus in a disparaging manner does Paul designate earthly man, for owing to the corruption of our nature we aspire to nothing worthy of our original. So also does God say in <span class="bvs">Gen_6:3</span>; where he complains that man was become flesh like the brute animals, and thus allows him nothing but what is earthly. To the same purpose is the declaration of Christ, “What is born of the flesh is flesh.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_3:6</span>.) But if any makes this objection — that the case with the soul is different; to this the ready answer is — that in our present degenerate state our souls are fixed to the earth, and so enslaved to our bodies, that they have fallen from their own superiority. In a word, the nature of man is said to be corporeal, because he is destitute of celestial grace, and is only a sort of empty shadow or image. We may add, that the body, by way of contempt, is said by Paul to be <em>mortal</em>, and this to teach us, that the whole nature of man tends to death and ruin. Still further, he gives the name of sin to the original depravity which dwells in our hearts, and which leads us to sin, and from which indeed all evil deeds and abominations stream forth. In the middle, between sin and us, he places lusts, as the former has the office of a king, while lusts are its edicts and commands. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(191)</span> That is, as a corrupt being: literally it is “for the whole mass of man.” The “body” here may be the same with that of “the old man” in <span class="bvs">Rom_6:6</span>; and the word for “lusts<span class="lang el-gr">,” ἐπιθυμίαις, </span> is often applied to designate the desires of the mind as well as the lusts of the natural body. The word<span class="lang el-gr">, θνητω, </span> “mortal,” would in this case mean, doomed to die, having been crucified; it is a body in the process of dying. Innate sin is here personified as a king, a ruler, and as having a body, he being “the old man;” and this body is represented as belonging to Christians — “your,” as the old man is — “our old man.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
