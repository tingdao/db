<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And the daughter of any priest. </em>The moderation and chastity (required in the priest <span class="cite-ref">(191)</span>) is extended also to his daughter; and by <em>synecdoche </em>all that relates to good discipline is comprised under a single head; viz., that his children should be educated in the study of virtue, and in decent and pure morality. A heavy punishment is denounced against a priest’s daughter if she should play the harlot, because sacrilege would be combined with her disgraceful licentiousness. But it is no light crime to violate God’s sanctuary; and, if the priest had tolerated such an iniquity in his daughter, he would have been no severe avenger of the same turpitude in strangers; nay, he would not have been at liberty to punish crimes, unless he made a beginning in his own house. </p><p><strong>(191)</strong> Added from <em>Fr. </em></p></div>
