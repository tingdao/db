<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>This day came ye out. </em>He compares the day of their coming out with the whole time of their sojourning in the land of Canaan; as if he had said that they were redeemed not to enjoy a mere transient joy, but that they might be mindful of their blessing throughout all ages. He proceeds to eulogize the extent and the fertility of the land again, principally for two reasons. The first is, lest after such glorious victories pride should possess their minds, and in the abundance of their good things their eyes should be closed by fatness;the second, that by the very multitude of their possessions they might be the more incited to the duty of gratitude, and to the service of God. For it might be that the conquerors of so many nations, and the lords of so rich and extensive a territory would wax wanton, so as to be less devoted to God’s service, unless they had been reminded that they owed it to God alone that they had conquered so many peoples, and had obtained dominion over them. But Moses shews them that, in proportion to God’s goodness to them, so would they be the more inexcusable, if they did not earnestly labor to testify heir gratitude. With this object he repeats the names of the nations, by the destruction of which they were to become inheritors of the land; and then adds, “a land flowing with milk and honey,” in order to arouse them still more and more to piety by the great profusion of the blessings which would be ever before their eyes. Those are entirely mistaken who suppose that the month <em>Abib </em><span class="cite-ref">(322)</span> is the same as <em>Ab, </em>which corresponds with our July. For it is evident that the Israelites came out of Egypt in the month <em>Nisan, </em>about the vernal equinox; of which circumstance, the keeping of Easter, handed down by tradition from our forefathers, is an unquestionable proof. Now, since the Hebrews borrowed from the Chaldeans all the names of their months, which were in use two thousand years after, it would be absurd in this place to regard <em>Abib </em>as a proper name, especially when, in Scripture, we nowhere find the months designated by proper names. Since, then, reason demonstrates that this word is applied appellatively, we must inquire why it is applied to March or the beginning of April. Those who translate <em>A bib </em>“ripening fruits,” have no ground for it, since the word simply means “anything which grows;” hence it is applied to the stalks of corn; and because in those warm climates the corn rises to its height about the vernal equinox, from this fact, <em>Nisan </em>is called the month of stalks. It is also a probable conjecture, (as we have already said,) that the beginning of the year was changed, in order that the nativity of the Church might receive more distinction; as if the world were then renewed. The opinion of some that Noah came out of the ark in the same month, so that the temperature of spring might receive him in his new birth, as well as the other animals, I leave undecided as I have done on <span class="bvs">Gen_8:0</span>. But if this opinion be accepted, there will be an anticipation <em>(prolepsis) </em>in the name of the months; and in this there will be an absurdity, because it was useful for the people to be accustomed to the rites of the Law. But I do not enter into controversy about uncertainties. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(322)</span><span class="lang he-il">אביב</span><em>C. </em>has copied the Hebrew in his text, writing it Abib, as a proper name; but in the <em>V. </em>it is translated “mensis novarum frugum,” and in <em>S.M</em>. , “mensis maturescentis frugis.” The name for July is <span class="lang he-il">אב</span>, which exists in Chaldee as a general name for the fleshy fruit of trees. David Levi says, in his <em>Lingua Sacra, </em>that one of their Rabbis had observed that Ab or Av is not to be found in Scripture, and that all the names of the Jewish months, as Sivan, Nisan, etc., are not Hebrew but Chaldee; for which reason we do not meet with them but in the books of Zechariah, Daniel, Ezra, and Esther, which were written during the captivity; and in these four books mention is made of seven of the months, but in the Jerusalem Targum of Esther they all follow regularly. This is also the opinion <em>of Aben-Ezra; </em>but adds, “we find three of the months named in Hebrew, viz., Zif, in <span class="bvs">1Kg_6:1</span>; Bul, in same chapter, verse 38, and Ethanira in 8:2; which plainly shews that they had names for all the months in Hebrew; but during the captivity they adopted those of their masters.” <span class="cite-note">—</span><em>W. </em></p></div></div>
