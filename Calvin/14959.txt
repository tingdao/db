<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. </em>The Psalmist here refers chiefly to two powers of the body, those of <em>the eyes </em>and of <em>the loins; </em>and I have no hesitation in considering his language as a prayer that God would deprive his enemies of reason and understanding, and at the same time enfeeble their strength, that they might be altogether unfitted for exerting themselves in any way. We know how indispensable it is, in order to the doing of any thing aright, that counsel go before to give light, and that there should also be added the power of putting what is purposed into execution. The curse here expressed impends over the heads of all the enemies of the Church; and, therefore, we have no reason to be terrified at the malice or fury of the wicked. God, whenever he pleases, can strike them suddenly with blindness, that they may see nothing, and by breaking their loins, <span class="cite-ref">(89)</span> lay them prostrate in shame and confusion. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(89)</span> The loins are the seat of strength in every animal; and hence the prayer, “Make their loins continually to tremble,” is just a prayer that their strength might be impaired, or entirely taken away. </p></div></div>
