<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19</strong><em>For the intent expectation of the creation</em>, <em>etc. </em>He teaches us that there is an example of the patience, to which he had exhorted us, even in mute creatures. For, to omit various interpretations, I understand the passage to have this meaning — that there is no element and no part of the world which, being touched, as it were, with a sense of its present misery, does not intensely hope for a resurrection. He indeed lays down two things, — that all are creatures in distress, — and yet that they are sustained by hope. And it hence also appears how immense is the value of eternal glory, that it can excite and draw all things to desire it. </p><p>Further, the expression, <em>expectation expects</em>, or waits for, though somewhat unusual, yet has a most suitable meaning; for he meant to intimate, that all creatures, seized with great anxiety and held in suspense with great desire, look for that day which shall openly exhibit the glory of the children of God. <em>The revelation of God’s children </em>shall be, when we shall be like God, according to what John says, </p><p>“For though we know that we are now his sons, yet it appears not yet what we shall be.” (<span class="bvs">1Jo_3:2</span>.) </p><p>But I have retained the words of Paul; for bolder than what is meet is the version of [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>], “Until the sons of God shall be manifest;” nor does it sufficiently express the meaning of the Apostle; for he means not, that the sons of God shall be manifested in the last day, but that it shall be then made known how desirable and blessed their condition will be, when they shall put off corruption and put on celestial glory. But he ascribes hope to creatures void of reason for this end, — that the faithful may open their eyes to behold the invisible life, though as yet it lies hid under a mean garb. </p></div>
