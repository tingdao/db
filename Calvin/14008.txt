<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>If he turn not </em>These verses are usually explained in two ways. The meaning is, that if David’s enemies should persevere in their malicious designs against him, there is denounced against them the vengeance which their obstinate wickedness deserves. Accordingly, in the second clause, they supply the name of <em>God, </em>—<em>If he turn not, GOD will whet his sword; </em><span class="cite-ref">(115)</span> as if it had been said, If my enemy do not repent, <span class="cite-ref">(116)</span> he shall, at length, feel that God is completely armed for the purpose of maintaining and defending the righteous. If it is understood in this sense, the third verse is to be considered as a statement of the cause why God will thus equip himself with armour, namely, because the ungodly, in conceiving all kinds of mischief, in travailing to bring forth wickedness, and in at length bringing forth deceit and falsehood, directly assail God, and openly make war upon him. But, in my judgment, those who read these two verses in one continued sentence, give a more accurate interpretation. I am not, however, satisfied that even they fully bring out the meaning of the Psalmist. David, I have no doubt, by relating the dreadful attempts of his enemies against him, intended thereby to illustrate more highly the grace of God; for when these malicious men, strengthened by powerful military forces, and abundantly provided with armour, furiously rushed upon him in the full expectation of destroying him, who would not have said that it was all over with him? Moreover, there is implied in the words a kind of irony, when he pretends to be afraid of their putting him to death. They mean the same thing as if he had said, “If my enemy do not alter his purpose, or turn his fury and his strength in another direction, who can preserve me from perishing by his hands? He has an abundant supply of arms, and he is endeavouring, by all methods, to accomplish my death.” But Saul is the person of whom he particularly speaks, and therefore he says, <em>he hath made fit his arrows for the persecutors </em>This implies that Saul had many agents in readiness who would willingly put forth their utmost efforts in seeking to destroy David. The design of the prophet, therefore, was to magnify the greatness of the grace of God, by showing the greatness of the danger from which he had been delivered by him. <span class="cite-ref">(117)</span> Moreover, when it is here said, if <em>he do not return, returning </em>does not signify repentance and amendment in David’s enemy, but only a change of will and purpose, as if he had said, “It is in the power of my enemy to do whatever his fancy may suggest.” <span class="cite-ref">(118)</span> Whence it appears the more clearly, how wonderful the change was which suddenly followed contrary all expectation. When he says that Saul had <em>prepared the instruments of death for his bow, </em>he intimates that he was driving after no ordinary thing, but was fully determined to wound to death the man whom he shot at. Some, referring the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">דולקים</span><em>doulekim, </em>which we have rendered <em>persecutors, </em>to <em>arrows, </em>have rendered it <em>burning, </em><span class="cite-ref">(119)</span> because it has also this signification; <span class="cite-ref">(120)</span> but the translation which I have given is the more appropriate. David complains that he had reason to be afraid, not only of one man, but of a great multitude, inasmuch as Saul had armed a powerful body of men to pursue and persecute a poor fugitive. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(115)</span> This is the view adopted by <em>Hengstenberg </em>in his excellent Commentary on The Psalms. “The apparently coarse manner of expression in our text,” says he, “representing God as a warrior equipped with sword and bow, has besides for its foundation the coarseness of sinners, and the weakness of faith on the part of believers, which does not direct itself against the visible danger with pure thoughts of God’s controllable agency, but seeks to clothe those thoughts with flesh and blood, and regards the judge as standing over against the sinner, man against man, sword against sword.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(116)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne cesse de me poursuyvre</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “Do not cease from pursuing me.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(117)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Duquel il avoit este delivre par luy</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(118)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Au reste, quand il est yci parle </span><em class="lang fr-fr">de se retourner, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">ce n’est pas pour signifier ce que nous appelons repentance et amendement en son ennemi, mais tant seulement une volonte et deliberation diverse; comme si’il dit qu’il estoit en la puissance de l’ennemi de parfaire tout ce qui luy venoit en la fantasie</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(119)</span> Those who adopt this rendering, support it from the reading of the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac versions, although the Chaldee version reads <em>persecuting; </em>and they generally view the 12th and 13th verses as a representation of God under the image of a warrior ready to shoot his flaming, burning, fiery arrows, against the object to which he is opposed.” I read <span class="lang he-il">וצלקים</span><em>urentes, </em><em>inflammatos </em><em>; </em>the arrows of the Almighty, (<span class="bvs">Deu_32:24</span>.) Languishments of famine, the burnings of the carbuncle, and the bitter pestilence. <em>Schultens</em>, (<span class="bvs">Pro_26:23</span>.) Lightnings are also called God’s arrows, (<span class="bvs">Psa_18:15</span>,) and represented as the artillery of heaven.”—<em>Dr Kennicott’s note on this place in his Select Passages of the Old Testament. Hengstenberg </em>takes the same view. His rendering is, <em>He [that is, God] makes his arrows burning. “ </em><span class="lang he-il">רלק</span>,<em>to burn. </em>In sieges it is customary to wrap round the arrows burning matter, and to shoot them after being kindled.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(120)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La ou nous avons mis </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Persecuteurs </em><span class="lang fr-fr">aucuns le rapportans </span><em class="lang fr-fr">aux fleches, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">traduissent Ardentes; pource que le mot Hebrieu emporte aussl ceste signification</span>.”—<em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
