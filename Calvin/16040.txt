<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>141.</strong><em>I am, insignificant and despised. </em>The meaning is, that although he was tried with poverty and many other calamities, he steadily persevered in the exercise of true godliness, and in the observance of the law. On that account, as he states, he was despised by wicked men. Every man gives praise to God just in proportion as he is gorged with his benefits; and very few will be found applying their minds to the service of God, unless they have all their wishes gratified. Hence it comes to pass that hypocrites, as long as they are pampered to the full, accumulate riches and increase in power, are very lavish in praising God. But let them be treated in some degree roughly, and immediately the blessed name of God is heard of no more. Since then men are ordinarily mercenary in serving God, let us learn from the Prophet’s example that true godliness is disinterested, so that when under its influence we <em>cease </em>not to praise God, although he may afflict us with adversity and make us despised in the eyes of the world. These upbraiding words of Christ in <span class="bvs">Joh_6:26</span>, ought, no doubt, to be carefully attended to, </p><p>“Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_6:26</span>) </p><p>The persons then who serve God ingenuously and sincerely, are such as continue steadfast in his fear, although their condition in this world may be mean and despised; in short, they are such as seek not their reward on earth, but through heat and cold, poverty and danger, slanders and mockeries, persevere with unwearied steps in the course of their warfare. </p></div>
