<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>43.</strong><em>Take not the word of truth too long out of my mouth </em><span class="cite-ref">(414)</span> It may be asked, why he demands rather to have his tongue filled with, than his heart fortified by, the <em>word of truth; </em>inasmuch as the latter takes the precedence, both in point of order and of excellence. What will it profit us to be fluent and eloquent in speech, if our hearts are destitute of faith? On the other hand, wherever there is firm faith, there to speech will flow ultroneously. My reply is, that David was not so concerned about outward confession as not to give the preference to the faith of the heart; but considering that he is making his address to God, there is nothing strange in his making mention only of the former, under which, however, he includes also the latter. “Lord, support not only my heart by faith, lest I be overwhelmed with temptation, but grant me also freedom of speech, that I may fearlessly sound forth thy praises among men.” We observe, when he asks to be endued with boldness of speech, that he begins with the heart. </p><p>It may be farther inquired here, why he says <em>too long, </em>just as if he were not afraid of being deprived of the word of truth for a short time. Such a supposition were most absurd, seeing we must watch every moment lest we be overtaken by the enemy, when we are unarmed and powerless. The solution of this difficulty must be drawn from our own experience; for in this, the infirmity of our flesh, it is almost impossible but that, occasionally, even the stoutest heart will quail under the violent assaults of Satan. And although their faith fails not, yet it shakes, and they do not find such presence of mind, as that there is constantly a uniform train of speech, and a prompt reply to the derision’s of the ungodly; but, on the contrary, they rather begin to stagger and quake for a short time. Conscious of this weakness, which is perceptible in all mankind, he accommodates his prayer in the following manner: “Though I am not always prepared with that boldness of speech which is desirable, suffer me not to continue long silent.” By this language the prophet tacitly admits, that he had not been so steadfast and bold as was requisite, but that he was, as it were, struck speechless by reason of fear. Whence we may learn, that the faculty of speaking freely is no more in our power than are the affections. of the heart. As far, then, as God directs our tongues, they are prepared for ready utterance; but no sooner does he withdraw the spirit of magnanimity, than not only our hearts faint, or rather fail, but also our tongues become mute. The cause of this is subjoined in these words, <em>for I have waited for thy judgments </em>for so he literally expresses himself. From which we conclude, that <em>judgments </em>refer not merely to the precepts of the law, but also to the promises, which constitute the true foundation of our confidence. Some render it, <em>I was afraid of thy. judgments, </em>deriving the word here employed from the root <span class="lang he-il">חול</span><em>chul; </em>which translation I am unable to say whether it be suitable or not. But of this I am certain, that to understand <em>judgments </em>as equivalent to <em>punishments, </em>is quite foreign to the design of the prophet. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(414)</span> “<em>O take not</em>, <em>etc</em>. This verse seems to admit of either of the two following interpretations: ‘Suffer me not to desist utterly from making an open profession of true religion; for I wait for thy promises:’ or, ‘Suffer me not to be reproached with falsehood, (for having asserted that thou wouldest take vengeance on the wicked,) because I have looked for thy judgments,’<em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , thy penal judgments. Calvin favors the former interpretation, the latter is Le Clerc’s.” — <em>Cresswell</em>. Walford, by <em>word</em>, understands the answer that the Psalmist had to make to the accusations of his enemies: and observes, “This answer, which asserted his innocence of the crimes with which they charged him, he declares to be altogether true; and he entreats that God, as a judge, would not suffer him to be deprived of the benefit of that answer, but pronounce a righteous sentence between them.” </p></div></div>
