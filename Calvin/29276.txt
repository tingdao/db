<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>There is one body. </em><span class="cite-ref">(139)</span> He proceeds to show more fully in how complete a manner Christians ought to be united. The union ought to be such that we shall form <em>one body and one soul. </em>These words denote the whole man. We ought to be united, not in part only, but in body and soul. He supports this by a powerful argument, <em>as ye have been called in one hope of your calling. </em>We are called to one inheritance and one life; and hence it follows, that we cannot obtain eternal life without living in mutual harmony in this world. One Divine invitation being addressed to all, they ought to be united in the same profession of faith, and to render every kind of assistance to each other. Oh, were this thought deeply impressed upon our minds, that we are subject to a law which no more permits the children of God to differ among themselves than the kingdom of heaven to be divided, how earnestly should we cultivate brotherly kindness! How should we dread every kind of animosity, if we duly reflected that all who separate us from brethren, estrange us from the kingdom of God! And yet, strangely enough, while we forget the duties which brethren owe to each other, we go on boasting that we are the sons of God. Let us learn from Paul, that none are at all fit for that inheritance who are not one body and one spirit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(139)</span> “There are ancient medals now extant, which have the figure of Diana on them, with this inscription, <span class="lang el-gr">κοινὸν τὢς ᾿Ασίας</span>, denoting that the cities of Asia were one body or commonwealth.
