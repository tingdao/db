<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here confirms what he had before said of the perverse wickedness of the people. He shews that he had not said without reason, that their sins were extremely gross, and could not be excused by any evasions: for they <em>say</em>, he adds, <em>to the wood, Thou art my father, and to the stone, Thou hast begotten, me </em>By these words the Prophet shews, that idolatry was so rampant among the people, that they openly ascribed to their statues, made of wood or stone, the honor due to the only true God. </p><p>But the Prophet points out here what is especially to be detested in idolatry, and that is, the transferring of the honor, due to God, to statues, not only as to the external act by bending the knee before them, but by seeking salvation from them. </p><p>And this is what we ought particularly to notice: for the Papists at this day, though they prostrate themselves before their pictures and statues, do not yet acknowledge themselves guilty of idolatry, when such a charge is brought against them. They say that they worship the statues, not with the honor due to God, but with such honor as a servant renders to his master. <span class="cite-ref">(59)</span> They think that they thus exculpate themselves. But were we to grant what they allege, they yet cannot deny but that they address prayers and supplications to statues. As then they ask the very statues to save them, whatever sophistry they may adopt, it is altogether nugatory: for the prophets condemn not merely the outward gesture, the bowing down, and other ceremonious acts, as they are called, when they condemned idolaters. What then? They condemned them, because they said to <em>statues, Thou art my Father; </em>that is, because they ascribed the power, which belongs only to God, to statues made of wood or stone. It is indeed certain, that the Jews never sunk into so great a depth of sottishness as expressly to profess that gods of wood and stone were equal to the true God, and they never said any such thing. Yet the Prophet did not calumniate them, in ascribing what is here said to them: but as it is clearly evident from other places, the Prophet regarded their thoughts rather than their words: for the Jews professed the same thing as the Papists of the present day, when they prostrated themselves before their statues; they said that they worshipped the only true God and sought salvation from him; and yet they thought that the power of God was inherent in the statues themselves: hence they said, <em>Thou art my father, Thou hast begotten me </em>The case is the same with the Papists of the present day. When any one prostrates himself before the statue of Catherine or of Christopher, he says, “Our Father.” When he justifies himself in doing this, he says that it is done in honor to the one true God: and yet thou runnest blindly, now to one statue, and then to another, and muttcrest, “Our Father.” There is not the least doubt but that the superstition which now prevails under the Papacy, is even more gross than that which prevailed among the Jews. But to say nothing of the Papists, because they mutter, “Our Father,” before their statues, there is no doubt but that when they present their prayers to statues, they consider God’s power to be in them. </p><p>We must now, then, bear in mind, that the Jews were not only condemned, because they burnt incense and offered sacrifices to idols, but because they transferred the glory of God to their statues, when they asked salvation from them. And as this was not done in express words, the Prophet here brings to light their impious thoughts; for they did not raise up their minds and thoughts to God, but turned them to their statues. </p><p>It afterwards follows, <em>They have turned to me the neck </em><span class="cite-ref">(60)</span><em>and not the face </em>In these words, God again confirms what he had before said, that the apostasy or defection of the people was more manifest than what could be disguised by any colorings. He then adds, <em>Yet </em>(the <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> is to be taken here adversatively) <em>in the time of their affliction, they will say, Arise, and save us </em>God here complains that the Jews most strangely abused his kindness; for they came to him when any grievous calamity constrained them. “What have I to do with you?” he says, “Ye are wholly devoted to your idols, ye call them your fathers, and ascribe to them the glory of your salvation, when things go on peaceably with you; but when your idols in time of distress give you no aid, then ye return to me and say, <em>Arise, and save us; </em>but, since idols are your fathers, and ye expect salvation from them, I shall have nothing to do with you; be contented with your idols, and trouble me no more, for I have been forsaken by you.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(59)</span> The words employed by <em>Calvin </em>are the technical terms, <em>latria </em> and <em>dulia </em><em>, </em>the fictions of the Papists. The first means specifically worship, and the second, service, obedience. The verb <span class="lang el-gr">δουλεύω</span> in the New Testament is never used in the sense of worshipping or adoring, but of serving and obeying: but to bow to images or to kiss them, is an act of adoration, and not of service. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(60)</span> The “neck” here means evidently the hinder part, for it is in contrast with “face;” and the word generally means the hinder part. Hence it is properly rendered here “back” in our version and by <em>Blayney, </em>and so by the <em>Targum </em>and the early versions, except the <em>Syriac, </em>which retains the hinder part of the neck. We have no single word, except it be nape, which denotes the back part of the neck. There is one in <em>Welsh, </em>“(lang. cy) gwegil,“ and so in <em>Latin, </em>“cervix,“ and in <em>Greek, </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἀυχὴν</span> But the <em>Septuagint </em>have adopted here “<span class="lang el-gr">νῶτα</span> — backs.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
