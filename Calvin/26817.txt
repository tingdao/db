<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled. </em>Finally, the Evangelist adds, that it was necessary that this should be done, in order that the prediction which Christ had uttered </p><p>might be fulfilled, The Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of the Gentiles, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_20:19</span>.) </p><p>And, indeed, if we wish to read with advantage the history of Christ’s death, the chief point is, to consider the eternal purpose of God. The Son of God is placed before the tribunal of a mortal man. If we suppose that this is done by the caprice of men, and do not raise our eyes to God, our faith must necessarily be confounded and put to shame. But when we perceive that by the condemnation of Christ, our condemnation before God is blotted out, because it pleased the Heavenly Father to take this method of reconciling mankind to himself, raised on high by this single consideration, we boldly, and without shame, glory even in Christ’s ignominy. Let us therefore learn, in each part of this narrative, to turn our eyes to God as the Author of our redemption. </p></div>
