<div class="comment-content"><p>The verb <span class="lang he-il">עיק</span>, <em>oik, </em>in Hebrew is often transitive, and it is also a neuter. This place then may admit of two interpretations. The first is, that God was pressed under the Israelites, as a wagon groans under too much weight; and so God expostulates by Isaiah, that he was weighed down by the Israelites, ‘Ye constrain me,’ he says, ‘to labor under your sins’ (<span class="bvs">Isa_1:14</span>) The sense then, that God was pressed down under them, may be viewed as not unsuitable: and yet the more received interpretation is this, “Behold, I will bind you fast as a wagon is bound.” I am, however, more inclined to take the first meaning, — that God here reprehends the Israelites, because he had been pressed down by them: for <span class="lang he-il">תחתיכם</span>, <em>tacheticam, </em>properly signifies, “Under you,” which some render, but strainedly, “Is your place:” for when the verb is transitive, they say, that <span class="lang he-il">תחתיכם</span>, <em>tacheticam, </em>must be rendered “In your place:” but this is frigid and forced; and the whole passage will run better, if we say, “I am bound fast under you, as though ye were a wagon full of sheaves; <span class="cite-ref">(21)</span> ” that is, “Ye are to me intolerable.” For God carried that people on his shoulders; and when they loaded him with the burden of iniquities, it is no wonder that he said that they were like a wagon — a wagon filled with many sheaves: “Ye are light as wind, but ye are also to me very burdensome, and I am forced at length to shake you off:” and this he afterwards shows. </p><p><strong>(21)</strong> This verse has caused great labor to commentators; and many have been the views given. The first difficulty is in the words rendered in our version, “under you.” <span class="lang he-il">תחת</span> and with the <em>Iod </em>commonly added when there is a suffix, often occurs, and means on doubt, an place, a spot, a standing, as in the following passages: <span class="bvs">Exo_10:23</span>; <span class="bvs">1Sa_14:9</span>; <span class="bvs">Hab_3:16</span>; and this seems to be its meaning here. Then the second difficulty is about “the cart” or wagon. Some consider it to be the vehicle to carry corn; and others, the machine to thresh it as Newcome and others do: but this view is not consistent with the other expressions used in this clause. </p><p>A critic, quoted by Poole, evidently gives the meaning in these words, Sensus est, q.d. Ego vos in eas angustas adducam, unde vos ipsos mimime expedire valeatis — “The sense is, as though he said, I will bring you to those straits, from which ye will by no means be able to deliver yourselves.” I would then translate the verse thus: — </p><p><em>Behold, I will confine </em>you<em>in your place, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>As a wagon confines its load </em>—<em>the sheaves; </em><em><LineBreak /></em>or word for word, <LineBreak /><em>As a wagon confines the filling of it </em>—<em>the sheaf. </em></p><p>The rendering of the last line by Newcome is certainly not what the original will bear; his translation of the whole verse is this: — </p><p>Therefore<em>, behold I will press your place, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>As a loaded corn-wain presseth its sheaves. </em></p><p>It is not pressing or crushing that corresponds with the contents of the following verses, but confining and reducing to straits from which they could not escape. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
