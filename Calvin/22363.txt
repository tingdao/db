Hence God in this verse declares that they shall not be partakers of his bounty; that though all Judea would be irrigated, though it would abound in honeys milk, and wine, yet these would remain barren and empty; <em>Mizraim, </em>then, <em>shall be a solitude, Edom shall be a desert of solitude. </em>Why? <em>Because of the troubles, he says, brought on the children of Judah. </em>God again confirms this truth, that he has such a concern for his Church, that he will avenge wrongs done to it.
