<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed. </em>Here, as formerly, he strengthens the hearts of believers, and addresses the whole Church; for the calamity was universal, and the Church appeared to be totally ruined. He bids her be of good cheer, and next assigns the reason; that the issue of her troubles will be such that she “shall not be ashamed;” as if he had said, “Although for a time thou art wretched, yet thy affairs shall be prosperous;” and as it is elsewhere said, “They who hope in the Lord shall not be ashamed.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_25:3</span>) </p><p><em>Blush not; </em>that is, “cherish good hope, and be confident.” Those men “blush” who are ashamed, and who, being disappointed of their hope, suffer their hearts to be cast down. He next assigns the same reason, “for thou shalt not be exposed to shame.” I consider that here, as formerly, <span class="lang he-il">כי</span><em>(ki) </em>signifies <em>for; </em>and therefore the same sentence is twice repeated under a variety of expressions, except that the former clause may relate to the disposition of the heart, and the latter to the external cause. But the more simple meaning of both clauses is, that it is a promise of success and prosperity, as if he had said that the calamity shall be brought to an end. </p><p><em>Yea, thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth. </em>This is a confirmation of the former clause. He means the calamities which befell the Church while she was still young, and the remembrance of which will be wholly obliterated by the prosperity which she shall afterwards enjoy. We mentioned a little before, that <em>widowhood </em>is a term used in regard to her, because God had forsaken, and, so to speak, had divorced her. </p></div>
