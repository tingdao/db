<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Say to the daughter of Zion. </em>This is not found, word for word, in Zechariah; but what God commanded one Prophet to proclaim, the Evangelist justly and appropriately applies to all godly teachers; for the only hope, on which the children of God ought both to build and to rely, was, that the Redeemer would at length come. Accordingly, the Prophet shows that the coming of Christ yields to believers a full and complete ground of joy; for, since God is not reconciled to them in any other way than through the agency of the Mediator, and as it is the same Mediator who delivers his people from all evils, what can there be, apart from him, that is fitted to cheer men ruined by their sins, and oppressed by troubles? And as we must be altogether overwhelmed with grief when Christ is absent, so on the other hand, the Prophet reminds believers that, when the Redeemer is present with them, they ought to be perfectly joyful. Now though he bestows on Christ other commendations — namely, that <em>he is just, and having salvation </em>— <em>Matthew </em>has taken but a single portion, which applied to the object he had in view, which is, that Christ will come, <em>poor </em>or <em>meek; </em>or in other words, that he will be unlike earthly kings, whose apparel is very magnificent and costly. Another mark of poverty is added, that he will<em>ride on an ass</em>, or <em>the foal of an ass; </em>for there can be no doubt that the manner of <em>riding </em>which belongs to the common people is contrasted with royal splendor. </p></div>
