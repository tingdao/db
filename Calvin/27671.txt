<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong>Luke doth briefly declare that Paul was also received at Ptolemais by the brethren. This is a city of Phenicia, standing upon the sea-coast, not far from the borders of Judea, from which Paul and his companions had no long journey to Cesarea. But if the readers be disposed to know farther touching the situation of regions, let them resort unto the describers of places and countries [geographers]. Furthermore, he saith, that when he came to Cesarea, they lodged with Philip, whom he calleth an Evangelist, though he were one of the seven deacons, as we may see in the sixth chapter ( <span class="bvs">Act_6:5</span>). By this we may easily gather, that that deaconship was an office which continued but for a time;<span class="cite-ref">(458)</span> because it had not otherwise been lawful for Philip to forsake Jerusalem, and to go to Cesarea. And in this place he is set before us, not as a voluntary forsaker of his office, but as one to whom a greater and more excellent charge was committed. The evangelists, in my judgment, were in the midst between apostles and doctors. For it was a function next to the apostles to preach the gospel in all places, and not to have any certain place of abode;<span class="cite-ref">(459)</span> only the degree of honor was inferior. For when Paul describeth the order of the Church, ( <span class="bvs">Eph_4:11</span>) he doth so put them after the apostles, that he showeth that they have more room given them where they may teach than the pastors, who are tied to certain places. Therefore, Philip did for a time exercise the office of a deacon at Jerusalem, whom the Church thought afterward to be a meet man to whom the treasure of the gospel should be committed.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(458)</span></p><p>“ Temporale munus,” a temporary trace, (appointment.) </p><p><span class="cite-note">(459)</span></p><p>“ Nec praeficerentur certae staticni,” and yet not be appointed to a fixed station. </p></div></div>
