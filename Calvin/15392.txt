<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Return, O Jehovah! how long? </em>After having spoken in the language of complaint, Moses adds a prayer, That God, who had not ceased for a long time severely to punish his people, would at length be inclined to deal gently with them. Although God daily gave them in many ways some taste of his love, yet their banishment from the land of promise was a very grievous affliction; for it admonished them that they were unworthy of that blessed inheritance which he had appointed for his children. They could not fail often to remember that dreadful oath which he had thundered out against them, </p><p>“Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Num_14:23</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(573)</span></p><p>Moses, no doubt, combines that sore bondage which they had suffered in Egypt with their wanderings in the wilderness; and therefore he justly bewails their protracted languishing in the words <em>how long? </em>As God is said to turn his back upon us, or to depart to a distance from us, when he withdraws the tokens of his favor, so by his return we are to understand the manifestation of his grace. The word <span class="lang he-il">נחם</span>, <em>nacham, </em>which we have translated <em>be pacified, </em>signifies to <em>repent, </em>and may therefore not improperly be explained thus: Let it repent thee concerning thy servants. According to the not unfrequent and well known phraseology of Scripture, God is said to repent, when putting away men’s sorrow, and affording new ground of gladness, he appears as it were to be changed. Those, however, seem to come nearer the mind of the Psalmist who translate, <em>Comfort thyself over thy servants; </em>for God, in cherishing us tenderly, takes no less pleasure in us than does a father in his own children. Now that is nothing else than to be pacified or propitious, as we have translated it, to make the meaning the more obvious. </p><p><strong>(573)</strong> “There is an ambiguity in <span class="lang he-il">כן</span>, as it denotes either <em>so </em>or<em>rightly </em>Hence the interpretation is twofold; either ‘so make us to know that we may cause a heart of wisdom to come,’ <em>i e</em>. , so instruct us that we may acquire a wise heart. Or, ‘teach us to number our days rightly,’ etc. LXX. give it another and distorted interpretation.” — <em>Bythner </em></p></div>
