<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>158.</strong><em>I saw the perfidious and child them. </em>In this verse the Psalmist proceeds yet farther, declaring that he was inflamed with a holy zeal when he saw the law of God despised by the wicked. Expositors are not however agreed as to one word in the text, namely the verb <span class="lang he-il">אתקוטטה</span><em>, ethkotatah, </em>which we have rendered <em>chid, </em>some deriving it from <span class="lang he-il">קוט</span>, <em>kut, </em>which often signifies <em>to debate </em>or <em>contend with, </em>it being in the conjugation <em>hithpael, </em>while others derive it from <span class="lang he-il">קטט</span><em>karat, </em>which signifies <em>to kill </em>or <em>to destroy. </em>I adopt the former interpretation, because it is more generally received among the learned, and is most appropriate. The Prophet then teaches that he was inflamed with such zeal for the law of God that he could no longer endure the impious mockery directed against it. The verb <em>debate </em>may however be understood as well of the vexation or anger which he felt in himself, as of the rebuke which he openly administered to the despisers of God; and therefore some translate it, <em>I shuddered, </em>or <em>I was grieved </em><span class="cite-ref">(30)</span> Nor assuredly will any person enter into debate with others for maintaining the glory of God, but he who is first chafed within himself, and has been grieved at heart; even as on the other hand, after this holy indignation there almost always follows transitive action; that is to say, it passes from the thought to the effect. <span class="cite-ref">(31)</span> In short, we are admonished by the example of the Prophet, that we ought to feel such displeasure at the contempt of God’s word as that our heart grows hot even to chiding. In the first place, then, let grief affect us inwardly; and next, whenever opportunity shall present itself, let; us strenuously endeavor to repress the forwardness and pride of the wicked, and let us not hesitate to do so from the fear of provoking their resentment against us. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(30)</span> “Invasit me horror.” —<em>Piscator. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(31)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, on vient de la pensee a l’effect</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
