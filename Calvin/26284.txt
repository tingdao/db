<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Jesus answered them. </em>Christ does not reply to the question put to him, which would have been fitted to show to them his power in having come thither by a miracle. <span class="cite-ref">(134)</span> But, on the contrary, he chides them for throwing themselves forward without consideration; for they were not acquainted with the true and proper reason of what he did, because they sought in Christ something else than Christ himself. The fault which he complains of in them is, that they seek Christ for the sake of the belly and <em>not of the miracles </em>And yet it cannot be denied that they looked to <em>the miracle; </em>nay more, the Evangelist has already told us that they were excited by the miracles to follow Christ. But because they abused the miracles for an improper purpose, he justly reproaches them with having a greater regard to the belly than to miracles. His meaning was, that they did not profit by the works of God as they ought to have done; for the true way of profiting would have been to acknowledge Christ as the Messiah in such a manner as to surrender themselves to be taught and governed by him, and, under his guidance, to aspire to the heavenly kingdom of God. On the contrary, they expect nothing greater from him than to live happily and at ease in this world. This is to rob Christ of his chief power; for the reason why he was given by the Father and revealed himself to men is, that he may form them anew after the image of God by giving them his Holy Spirit, and that he may conduct them to eternal life by clothing them with his righteousness. </p><p>It is of great importance, therefore, what we keep in view in the miracles of Christ; for he who does not aspire to the kingdom of God, but rests satisfied with the conveniences of the present life, seeks nothing else than to fill his belly. In like manner, there are many persons in the present day who would gladly embrace the gospel, if it were free from the bitterness of the cross, and if it brought nothing but carnal pleasures. Nay,we see many who make a Christian profession, that they may live in greater gaiety and with less restraint. Some through the expectation of gain, others through fear, and others for the sake of those whom they wish to please, profess to be the disciples of Christ. In seeking Christ, therefore, the chief point is, to despise the world and </p><p>seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_6:33</span>.) </p><p>Besides, as men very generally impose on themselves, and persuade themselves that they are seeking Christ in the best manner, while they debase the whole of his power, for this reason Christ, in his usual manner, doubles the word <em>verily, </em>as if by the oath he intended to bring to light the vice which lurks under our hypocrisy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(134)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce qui eust este propre pour leur monstrer sa puissance, en ce qu’il estoit la venu par miracle</span>.” </p></div></div>
