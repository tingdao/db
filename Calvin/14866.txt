<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>Terrible things </em><span class="cite-ref">(453)</span><em>in righteousness wilt thou answer to us </em>He proceeds to illustrate, although in a somewhat different form, the same point of the blessedness of those who are admitted into the temple of God, and nourished in his house. He declares that God would answer his people by miracles or fearful signs, displaying his power; as if he had said, in deliverances as wonderful as those which he wrought for their fathers when they went out of Egypt. It is in no common or ordinary manner that God has preserved his Church, but with terrible majesty. It is well that this should be known, and the people of God taught to sustain their hopes in the most apparently desperate exigencies. The Psalmist speaks of the deliverances of God as specially enjoyed by the Jewish nation, but adds, that he was <em>the hope of the ends of the earth, </em>even to the world’s remotest extremities. Hence it follows, that the grace of God was to be extended to the Gentiles. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(453)</span> The original word for <em>terrible things </em>“signifies sometimes <em>terrible </em>sometimes w<em>onderful things</em>, anything that exceeds in greatness or quality. In the latter sense we have it, <span class="bvs">Deu_10:21</span>, when speaking of God, it is said, ‘He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things,’ —<em>great</em>, <em>exceeding</em>, <em>wonderful things</em>; and those acts of mercy, and not of justice or punishment; and so here it appears to signify, being joined with <em>answering us</em>, or <em>granting us</em>, <em>in answer to our prayers</em>, (so <span class="lang he-il">ענת</span> signifies <em>to answer a request</em>, <em>to hear a prayer</em>,) and with <em>in righteousness</em>, which frequently imports <em>mercy </em>The LXX. accordingly read it <span class="lang el-gr">θαυμαστὸς</span>, <em>wonderful</em>. ” —<em>Hammond </em></p></div></div>
