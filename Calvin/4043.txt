<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves. </em>This is another part of the answer, which is given respecting the matter in consideration, viz., that the people should prepare themselves to satiate their greediness. Although the word <span class="lang he-il">קדש</span><span class="cite-ref">(26)</span><em>kadesh, </em>signifies to <em>prepare, </em>yet its literal meaning seems to be most appropriate here; I have therefore retained the word <em>sanctify, </em>which is, however, here used ironically, for Moses does not exhort: them to purge themselves from all defilement’s, and piously and sincerely to receive the grace of God, but he chastises their profane and brutal gluttony. Others translate it simply, as if it were said, Whet your teeth, and make ready your bellies: but, in my judgment, there is a reproof implied, because they are polluted by a foul and wicked desire, so as to be incapable of receiving God’s paternal favor: for “ye shall eat flesh” follows, “because your weeping and complaining has reached the ears of God;” by which words he signifies that by their importunate cries they had provoked God’s anger, so that they should devour none but deadly food. And soon afterwards it is stated more clearly that by their insolence they had deserved to be destroyed by the bounty of God. For “a whole month,” he says, ye shall gormandize, “till it come out of your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you.” Thus he compares them to those guttlers who so overwhelm themselves with gluttony, that they are obliged soon afterwards to vomit what they have eaten too greedily, or who abominate the taste of their superfluous luxuries, as if they were something filthy. This is what is meant by to “come out,” or to be blown out, “at the nostrils.” <span class="lang he-il">זרא</span><span class="cite-ref">(27)</span><em>tzara, </em>which we have translated <em>abomination, </em>properly means <em>dispersion; </em>but Moses indicates by it that they shall vomit, or spit it out, like something unfit to be swallowed. If any should object that it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_78:30</span>, “They were not yet estranged from their lust:” this is easily solved by understanding that their unrestrained gluttony is there rebuked, <span class="cite-ref">(28)</span> as if he called them guttlers <em>(gurgites,) </em>whom no abundance can suffice to satisfy. Therefore the Prophet says, that although they were bursting with excess, they were not satiated; but were so inflamed by their boundless voracity, that God’s vengeance could alone repress it. But the reason alleged for this is especially to be observed, “because they had rejected God, who was in the midst of them.” By these words, the excuse of error or inadvertency is barred; for if, for the purpose of proving their patience God had withdrawn His power, the terror which they conceived at His absence might, perhaps, have been excusable; but now, when they knew by sure experience that their means of subsistence were supplied by Him, they betray their deliberate wickedness by despising His present beneficence. For that God was in the midst of them is equivalent to His giving manifest tokens both of His infinite power and His paternal favor. These words show us that the more immediately God manifests His grace to us, the more inexcusable we are, if we disparage it when it is thus liberally offered to us. What follows might appear not to deserve severe reproof, viz., that they “wept before God;” but the enormity of the sin is specified directly afterwards, <em>i.e. </em>that they were vexed by their departure from Egypt: for this was not merely to repudiate the deliverance, which they had so greatly longed for, but to quarrel with God, because He had listened to their cry, and had condescended to redeem them from their wretched and lost estate. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(26)</span> If <span class="lang he-il">קדש</span> may be said to signify to prepare, it can only be so rendered when the preparation is by sanctifying. — W. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(27)</span><span class="lang he-il">זרא</span> (loathsomeness) is said by S.
