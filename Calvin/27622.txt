For seeing that all superstition is profane and polluted, it followeth that those be sacrilegious persons who translate the honor which is due to God alone unto idols. But the wisdom of the town-clerk, and that carnal, is here commended, and not his godliness. For he had respect unto this alone to extinguish the heat of the uproar; and therefore doth he at length conclude, if Demetrius have any private matter, there be judgment-seats and magistrates. And that public affairs must be handled in a lawful, and not in a disordered assembly — in an assembly gathered by the commandment of the magistrates, and not in a concourse which is without consideration, run together through the motion of one man, and to satisfy his appetite.<span class="cite-ref">(399)</span> He calleth them deputies,<span class="cite-ref">(400)</span> in the plural number, not that Asia had more than one, but because legates did sometimes keep courts in the place of the deputies. Also, he appeaseth them by putting them in fear, because the deputy had occasion offered to punish and fine the city sore.<span class="cite-ref">(401)</span></p><p><strong>(399)</strong></p><p>“ Unius hominis impulsu et libidine,” at the instigation and caprice of one man. </p><p><strong>(400)</strong></p><p>“ Proconsules,” proconsuls. </p><p><strong>(401)</strong></p><p>“Quia proconsuli oblatu erat occasio urbis male mulctandae ,” because an opportunity was given to the proconsul to impose a heavy fine on the city. </p></div>
