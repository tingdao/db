<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And the king of Sodom went out</em>. Although the king of Sodom knew that Abram had taken arms only on account of his nephew, yet he went to meet him with due honor, in order to show his gratitude. For it is a natural duty to acknowledge benefits conferred upon us, even when not intentionally rendered, but only from unexpected circumstances and occasions, or (as we say) by accident. Moreover, the whole affair yields greater glory to God, because the victory of Abram was celebrated in this manner. He also marks the place where the king of Sodom met Abram, namely, “the king’s dale,” which I think was so called, rather after some particular king, than because those kings met there for their pleasure. <span class="cite-ref">(361)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(361)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Quan quod animi causa reges illuc convenirent.” </p></div></div>
