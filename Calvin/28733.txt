Yet this also was no trivial absurdity — that the Apostles, who were ordained by God to be the heralds of his eternal truth, were detected as persons who had deceived the world with falsehoods; for this tends to God’s highest dishonor. </p><p>The expression,<em>false witnesses of God, </em>we may understand in two ways — either that by <em>lying </em>they used the name of God under a false pretext, or that they were detected as <em>liars, </em>in testifying what they had received from God. The <em>second </em>of these I rather prefer, because it involves a crime that is much more heinous, and he had spoken previously as to men. <span class="cite-ref">(36)</span> Now, therefore, he teaches that, if the resurrection of Christ is denied, God is made guilty of falsehood in the witnesses that have been brought forward and hired by him. <span class="cite-ref">(37)</span> The reason, too, that is added, corresponds well — because they had declared what was false, not as from themselves, but from God. </p><p>I am at the same time well aware that there are some that give another rendering to the particle <span class="lang el-gr">κατα</span> The old interpreter renders it <em>against. </em><span class="cite-ref">(38)</span> Erasmus, on the other hand — <em>concerning. </em><span class="cite-ref">(39)</span> But, as it has also among the Greeks the force of <span class="lang el-gr">ἀπό</span>, (from,) this signification appeared to me to be more in accordance with the Apostle’s design. For he is not speaking here of the reputation of men, (as I have already stated, <span class="cite-ref">(40)</span>) but he declares that God will be exposed to the charge of falsehood, inasmuch as what they publish has come forth from him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(36)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et aussi il auoit desia parle du deshonneur qui en reuindroit aux hommes, c’est a dire aux Apostres et autres prescheurs</span>;” — “And besides, he had spoken previously of the dishonor that resulted from it to men — that is to say, to the Apostles and other preachers.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(37)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme subornez</span>;” — “As it were hired.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(38)</span> In accordance with this Wiclif (1380) renders the words thus — “We haw seide witnessynge agens God.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(39)</span><em>Raphelius </em>adduces two instances of <span class="lang el-gr">Ταῦτα μὲν δὴ κατα πάντων Περσῶν ἔχομεν λέγειν</span> — being employed by classical writers in the sense of <em>concerning. </em>“And these are things that we may affirm <em>concerning </em>all the Persians.” — (Xen.
