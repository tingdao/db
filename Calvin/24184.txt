<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>54.</strong><em>Now the centurion. </em>As Luke mentions the <em>lamentation </em>of the people, <em>the centurion </em>and his soldiers were not the only persons who acknowledged Christ to be <em>the Son of God; </em>but the Evangelists mention this circumstance respecting him for the purpose of heightening their description: for it is wonderful that an irreligious man, who had not been instructed in the Law, and was ignorant of true religion, should form so correct a judgment from the signs which he beheld. This comparison tends powerfully to condemn the stupidity of the city; for it was an evidence of shocking madness, that when the fabric of the world <em>shook and trembled, </em>none of the Jews were affected by it except the despised rabble. And yet, amidst such gross blindness, God did not permit the testimonies which he gave respecting his Son to be buried in silence. Not only, therefore, did true religion open the eyes of devout worshippers of God to perceive that from heaven God was magnifying the glory of Christ, but natural understanding compelled foreigners, and even soldiers, to confess what they had not learned either from the law or from any instructor. </p><p>When Mark says that <em>the centurion </em>spoke thus, because Christ, <em>when he had uttered a loud voice, expired, </em>some commentators think that he intends to point out the unwonted strength which remained unimpaired till death; and certainly, as the body of Christ was almost exhausted of blood, it could not happen, in the ordinary course of things, that the sides and the lungs should retain sufficient rigor for uttering so loud a cry. Yet I rather think that <em>the centurion </em>intended to applaud the unshaken perseverance of Christ in calling on the name of God. Nor was it merely the <em>cry of </em>Christ that led <em>the centurion </em>to think so highly of him, but this confession was extorted from him by perceiving that his extraordinary strength harmonized with heavenly miracles. </p><p>The words, <em>he feared God, </em><span class="cite-ref">(289)</span> must not be so explained as if he had fully repented. <span class="cite-ref">(290)</span> It was only a sudden and transitory impulse, as it frequently happens, that men who are thoughtless and devoted to the world are struck with the fear of God, when he makes an alarming display of his power; but as they have no living root, indifference quickly follows, and puts an end to that feeling. <em>The centurion </em>had not undergone such a change as to dedicate himself to God for the remainder of his life, but was only for a moment the herald of the divinity of Christ. </p><p>When Luke represents him as saying no more than <em>certainly this was a righteous man, </em>the meaning is the same as if he had plainly said that he was <em>the Son of God, </em>as it is expressed by the other two Evangelists. For it had been universally reported that Christ was put to death, because he declared himself to be the Son of God. Now when <em>the centurion </em>bestows on him the praise of <em>righteousness, </em>and pronounces him to be innocent, he likewise acknowledges him to be <em>the Son of God; </em>not that he understood distinctly how Christ was begotten by God the Father, but because he entertains no doubt that there is some divinity in him, and, convinced by proofs, holds it to be certain that Christ was not an ordinary man, but had been raised up by God. </p><p>As to <em>the multitudes, </em>by <em>striving their breasts, </em>they expressed the dread of punishment for a public crime, because they felt that public guilt had been contracted by an unjust and shocking murder. <span class="cite-ref">(291)</span> But as they went no farther, their lamentation was of no avail, unless, perhaps, in some persons it was the commencement or preparation of true repentance. And since nothing more is described to us than the lamentation which God drew from them to the glory of his Son, let us learn by this example, that it is of little importance, or of no importance at all, if a man is struck with terror, when he sees before his eyes the power of God, until, after the astonishment has been abated, the fear of God remains calmly in his heart. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(289)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand il est dit </span><em class="lang fr-fr">qu’il craignit Dieu </em>;” — “when it is said <em>that he feared God. </em>” Calvin does not quote in this instance the exact words of Scripture. Of<em>the centurion and those who were with him, </em>Matthew says, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐφοζήθησαν σφόδρα</span>,) <em>they were greatly terrified; </em>and of the <em>centurion </em>Luke says, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐδόξασε τὸν Θεόν</span>,) <em>he glorified God. </em>—<em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(290)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ne faut pas entendre qu’il ait esté entierement converti</span>;” — “we must not understand them to mean that he was fully converted.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(291)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Elles ont lamenté, craignans que malheur n’adveint sur tout le pays pour punition de ce qu’ils avoyent tous consenti à la condamnation et mort inique de Christ</span>.” — “They lamented, fearing that something unhappy would befall their country, as a punishment for their having all consented to the condemnation and unjust death of Christ.” </p></div></div>
