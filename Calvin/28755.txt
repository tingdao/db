<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>Thou sowest not that body that will spring up. </em>This comparison consists of two <em>parts </em>â€” <em>first, </em>that it is not to be wondered that bodies rise from rottenness, inasmuch as the same thing takes place as to seed; and <em>secondly, </em>that it is not at variance with reason, that our bodies should be restored in another condition, since, from bare grain, God brings forth so many ears of corn, clothed with admirable contrivance, and stored with grains of superior quality. As, however, he might seem to intimate, by speaking in this way, that many bodies will therefore rise out of one, he modifies his discourse in another way, by saying that God <em>forms the body as it pleases him, </em>meaning that in that also there is a difference in respect of quality. </p><p>He adds, <em>to every seed its own body </em>By this clause he restricts what he had said respecting another body; for he says that, while the body is different, it is in such a way as to retain, nevertheless, its particular kind. </p></div>
