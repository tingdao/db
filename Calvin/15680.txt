<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28</strong><em>And they joined themselves to Baal-peor </em>The prophet tells us that the Jews, after they had been threatened with very awful punishment, very soon fell into a new species of apostasy. Some think, that they are indirectly accused of falling away to the superstitions of the Midianites, in consequence of having been imposed upon by female intrigue. This, it is well known, was the design of Balaam, as soon as he knew that he was forbidden by God to curse the people. His counsel to king Balak was to set the daughters of Moab before the people, to entice them by their allurements to the practice of idolatry, </p><p>“Behold, these women caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor.” <span class="bvs">Num_31:16</span></p><p>And as the idolatry here mentioned originated from carnal intrigues, some expositors are of opinion, that on this account the prophet charges the people with the commission of a twofold trespass, in their not only being inveigled by the Midianitish women, but also in binding themselves by another bond to Baal-peor, (<span class="bvs">Num_25:0</span>) Be that as it may, the prophet exclaims against the perfidy of his own nation, because in forsaking the true worship of God, they had broken that holy union by which they had been betrothed to him. For we know, that as God adopts the Church as his spouse, when she gives herself up to idolatry, she no less shamefully violates her fidelity, than when a wife leaves her husband, and becomes an adulteress. It is well known, that Baal-peor was the idol of the Midianites; but it is not so well known how he received this appellation. The word <span class="lang he-il">בעל</span>, <em>Baal, </em>has a signification <span class="cite-ref">(258)</span> equivalent to <em>lord, master, </em>or <em>patron. </em>And since <span class="lang he-il">פער</span><em>, paar, </em>signifies <em>to open, </em>some render it <em>the God of opening, </em>and assign as a reason, which, however, I dare not affirm, their shamefully exposing themselves in his presence. Perhaps it is the name of some place, for we know that the heathens often gave to their idols the names of the countries where they were worshipped. <span class="cite-ref">(259)</span> We now perceive the prophet’s meaning, That the Jews had wickedly revolted from God, and defiled themselves in joining themselves to Baal-peor. In saying that they <em>ate the sacrifices of the dead, </em><span class="cite-ref">(260)</span> he points out the greater baseness of their offense. By the sacrifices of idols, he means that they ate things that were offered to idols, as they had been wont to partake of those sacrifices which bound them to the true God, the inexhaustible fountain of life. Hence their conduct was the more detestable, when they wilfully gave themselves over to death by perpetrating such a heinous crime. And we know, that banqueting was to some extent connected with their worship. The result of this was, that, renouncing the true God, they joined themselves in marriage with the dead; and thus the prophet charges them with acting a very disgraceful part, in not only bowing the knee to Baal, and offering sacrifices to him, but also in feasting upon these sacrifices. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(258)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Signifie autant comme Maistre ou Patron</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(259)</span> Baal was a very common name of the principal male god of the nations of the East, as Ashtaroth was a common one for their chief female deity. The Moabites, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and often the Hebrews, worshipped this idol. Among the Babylonians, he was called Bel or Belus. The sun only might at first be worshipped under that name, as we know that under it the Phoenicians adored that luminary. But at length it came to be applied to many other idols, according to these words of the Apostle, “There be gods many, and <em>baalims, </em>or lords many,” <span class="bvs">1Co_8:5</span>. As the idol Jupiter among the Romans had different names and different rites of worship, occasioned sometimes from the different benefits which he was thought to bestow upon men, as Jupiter Pluvius, because he gave rain, Jupiter Lucetius, because he gave light, Jupiter Altitonans, from thundering; and sometimes from different places — as Jupiter Olympius, from the hill Olympus, Jupiter Capitolinus, from the Capitol hill, Jupiter Latialis, from that part of Italy which is called Latium: so Baal had his distinctive titles, and different rites of worship, occasioned in the same manner. He sometimes received his name from the benefits he was supposed to confer, as Baal-tsephon, (<span class="bvs">Exo_14:1</span>) the latter term denoting <em>a watcher, </em>and Baalzebub, (<span class="bvs">2Kg_1:2</span>) which signifies <em>the lord of the flies. </em>He was worshipped under this last name by the Cyrenians, but principally by Ekronites, because, whenever they sacrificed to him, they believed that the swarms of flies, which at that time molested the country, would die. At other times he received a distinctive appellation from the places where he was worshipped, as Baal-peor, from the hill Peor, mentioned in <span class="bvs">Num_23:28</span>; and his temple, whither his votaries resorted, standing on the same hill, was called <em>Beth-peor, </em><span class="bvs">Deu_3:29</span>. Possibly, however, the mountain might have taken its name from the god that was there worshipped. The idol named <em>Chemosh, </em>in <span class="bvs">Jer_48:7</span>, is thought to be the same as Baal-peor. “I take it,” says Goodwin, “to be applied to Baal-peor, by way of contempt, as if one should say their <em>blind god, </em>according to that in the psalm, ‘They have eyes, and see not;’ for the first letter, <em>caph, </em>signifies <em>as it were, </em>or <em>like, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">מוש</span>, <em>musch, to grope, </em>or <em>feel about in manner of blind men. </em>”<em>Moses and Aaron, </em>page 170. This idol was also called <em>Baal-bereth, </em>(<span class="bvs">Jud_8:33</span>, and 9:4,) from his worshippers binding themselves to him by covenant. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(260)</span> “The dead” appears to be a term of contempt applied to idols. They are so called in opposition to the true and living God. There may also be an allusion to the fact, that many of the heathen idols were men who had been deified after their death. </p></div></div>
