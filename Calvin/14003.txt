<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>And a congregation of peoples </em>Some limit this sentence exclusively to the people of Israel, as if David promised that, as soon as he should ascend the throne, he would endeavour to reunite together, in the pure worship of God, the people who before had been as it were in a state of dispersion. Under the reign of Saul, religion had been neglected, or such an unrestrained license in wickedness had prevailed, that few paid any regard to God. The meaning, therefore, according to these expositors, is this: Lord, when thou shalt have constituted me king, the whole people, who have so basely gone astray from thee, <span class="cite-ref">(106)</span> shall return from their wanderings and disorderly courses to thee and to thy service, so that all shall know that thou rulest in the midst of them, and shall worship thee as their only King. But I am rather inclined to view this as language which has a respect in common to many nations. David here speaks in high terms of the effects resulting from his deliverance, the report of which would be spread far and wide, and his words are, as if he had said, “Lord, when thou shalt have put me in peaceable possession of the kingdom, this will not only be a benefit conferred on me personally, but it will be a common lesson to many nations, teaching them to acknowledge thy just judgment, so that they shall turn their eyes to thy judgment-seat.” <span class="cite-ref">(107)</span> David here alludes to the practice of a people who surround their king, as in a circle, when he holds a solemn assembly. In the same sense, he adds immediately after, that God, who, for a time, lay still and kept silence, would raise himself on high that not only one or two, but whole nations, might behold his glory: <em>And on account of this return thou on high </em><span class="cite-ref">(108)</span> There is in these words, a tacit comparison, that although it might not be necessary to have a regard to one man alone, it is requisite that God should keep the world in the fear and reverence of his judgment. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(106)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tout le peuple qui s’estoit ainsi vilenement destourne de toy</span>.”—<em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(107)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais ce sera un enseignement commun a plusieurs peuples, pour recognoistre ton juste jugement, tellement qu’ils dresseront les yeux vers ton siege judicial</span>.”—<em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(108)</span><em>Fry </em>reads, “And over it resume thy high tribunal.” He supposes that the word <span class="lang he-il">עליה</span>, <em>aleha, </em>which Calvin has rendered <em>on account of this, </em>may be understood, “concerning this affair,” and gives the following paraphrase: ”Resume thy judgment-seat, in order to investigate the cause in which I have been prejudged by the adversary.” </p></div></div>
