<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Lest there be not enough for you and us. </em>We know that the Lord distributes his gifts so variously to each, according to his measure, in order that they may give mutual aid to each other, and may employ for the general advantage what has been entrusted to each individual; and that in this way is preserved the sacred connection which exists among the members of the Church. But Christ here points out the time when he shall summon all men to his tribunal, each carrying his bundle, that he may bring with him according as he has done in his body. That portion of grace received, which every man has laid up for himself, is, therefore, justly compared to a stock of provisions for a journey, which <em>would not be enough </em>for a greater number of persons. </p><p><em>But rather go to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. </em>These words immediately follow, and are not intended as an admonition, but a reproof; and the meaning is: “There once was a time for <em>buying, </em>which you ought not to have neglected; for <em>oil </em>was at that time offered for sale, but the means of obtaining it are now withdrawn.” And yet it is foolish in the Papists to infer from this, that by our own virtues or industry we obtain the gift of perseverance. For the word <em>buy </em>does not at all imply that a price has been given; as appears clearly from the passage in Isaiah, (55:1) where the Lord, while he invites us <em>to buy, </em>demands no price, but informs us, that he has <em>wine and milk in abundance, </em>to be gratuitously bestowed. There is no other way of obtaining it, therefore, but to receive by faith what is offered to us. </p></div>
