<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And Abraham stood up</em>. He declines the favor offered by the Hittites, as, some suppose, with this design, that he might not lay himself under obligation to them in so small a matter. But he rather wished to show, in this way, that he would receive no gratuitous possession from those inhabitants who were to be ejected by the hand of Gods in order that he might succeed in their place: for he always kept all his thoughts fixed on God, so that he far preferred His bare promise, to present dominion over the land. Moses also commends the modesty of the holy man, when he says that he ‘rose up to do reverence to the people of the land.’ <span class="cite-ref">(454)</span> As to the use of the word signifying ‘to adore,’ it is simply taken for the reverence, which any one declares, either by bowing the knee, or any other gesture of the body. This may be paid to men, as well as to God, but for a different end; men mutually either bend the knee, or bow the head, before each other, for the sake of civil honor; but if the same thing be done to them, for the sake of religion, it is profanation. For religion allows of no other worship them that of the true God. And they childishly trifle who make a pretext for their idolatry, in the words <em>dulia </em> and <em>latria </em>, <span class="cite-ref">(455)</span> since the Scripture, in general terms, forbids adoration to be transferred to men. But lest any one should be surprised that Abraham acted so suppliantly, and so submissively, we must be aware that it was done from common custom and use. For it is well known that the Orientals were immoderate in their use of ceremonies. If we compare the Greeks or Italians with ourselves, we are more sparing in the use of them than they. But Aristotle, in speaking of the Asiatics and other barbarians notes this fault, that they abound too much in adorations. Wherefore we must not measure the honor which Abraham paid to the princes of the land by our customs. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(454)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Ut adoraret populum terrae.” This is not a correct quotation from his own version of the chapter, which is, “Incurvavit se populo terrae,” as in our version, “bowed himself to the people of the land.” — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(455)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Ac pueriliter nugantur qui in vocibus duliae et latriae fucum faciunt.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui pensent farder leur idolatrie par ces mots de Dulie et Latrie</span>.” — <em>French Tr </em></p></div></div>
