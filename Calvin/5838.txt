<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>The eternal God is thy refuge. </em>This is just as if he had said that the Israelites were protected from above by the help of God, and also based, as it were, upon Him. The beginning of the prayer corresponds with that other in <span class="bvs">Psa_90:1</span>, “Lord<em>, </em>thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.” The sum is, that although the Israelites might be exposed to many injuries, still there was secure repose for them under the shadow of God’s wings; and assuredly unless the hand of God had been like a roof to protect them, they would have perished a thousand times over. But, inasmuch as it would not be sufficient for our heads to be in safety, the other point is also added, viz., that God’s arms should be stretched forth to sustain them from beneath. He calls them “everlasting,” because the security of the pious, who rely upon God, is never shaken: it is, therefore, just as though he represented God to be at the same time the foundation, and the roof, of their abode. Others translate it less correctly, “Thou shalt live under the arms of the Everlasting;”for an elegant distinction is drawn, <span class="cite-ref">(326)</span> which, however, tends to the same point, when God it called <span class="lang he-il">קדם</span>, <em>kedem, </em>and His arms <span class="lang he-il">עלם</span>, <em>gnolam, </em>the first of which words has reference to the past, whilst in the other there is allusion to the future; as if he had said of God, that He was from the beginning, and that His power would endure unto the end. </p><p>He adduces experimental evidence of the above statements, inasmuch as God had <span class="cite-ref">(327)</span> miraculously destroyed the enemies of His people; at the same time he specifies the manner in which this was done, viz., that He had said, Destroy, or blot out, or dissipate. And by this word he signifies that, although God had made use of the agency of the Israelites, still He only was the conqueror; since the Israelites prevailed not except at His bidding, and by His will. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(326)</span> This sentence is omitted in the Latin edition of 1563 though given in substance in the French of 1564. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(327)</span> It will be seen that <em>C</em>. translates the verbs here in the past tense; <em>A.
