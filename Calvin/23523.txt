<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>Either make the tree good </em>It might look like absurdity, that men should be allowed a choice of being <em>either good or bad; </em>but if we consider what sort of persons Christ is addressing, the difficulty will be speedily resolved. We know what opinion was generally entertained about the Pharisees; for their pretended sanctity had so blinded the minds of the common people, that no one ventured to pass sentence on their vices. <span class="cite-ref">(134)</span> Wishing to remove this mask, Christ desires them to be <em>either good or bad</em>; or, in other words, declares that nothing is more inconsistent with honesty than hypocrisy, and that it is in vain for men to boast of pretensions to righteousness who are not sincere and upright. <span class="cite-ref">(135)</span> So then he puts nothing at their disposal, and withdraws no restraint from them, but only reminds them that their empty professions will avail them nothing so long as they are double, because they must be <em>either good or bad </em></p><p>From the expression, <em>make the tree, </em>some foolishly infer, that it is in every man’s power to regulate his own life and conduct. It is a rhetorical mode of speaking, by which Christ points out the scribes, dispels—so to speak—the smoke of their hypocrisy, and recalls them to pure and genuine uprightness. He afterwards explains the way and manner in which they may show that they are <em>good or bad trees; </em>which is by yielding <em>good or bad fruit: </em>so that there is no ambiguity in the meaning. The life of the scribes was not rendered infamous among men by gross vices. Pride, ambition, and envy, displayed their venom in the slanders which they uttered; but as that venom was not perceived by ignorant people, Christ brings the concealed evil from its lurking-place, and drags it forth to light. </p><p>But perhaps it will be objected that, in consequence of the corruption of our nature, it is impossible to find any man who is altogether upright, and free from every vice. The answer is ready. Christ does not demand absolute and entire perfection, but only a sincere and unfeigned disposition, which the Pharisees whom he addresses were far from possessing. As Scripture applies the terms, <em>bad and wicked, </em>to those who are completely given up to Satan, so the sincere worshippers of God, though they are encompassed by the infirmity of their flesh and by many sins, and groan under the burden, are called <em>good. </em>This arises from the undeserved kindness of God, who bestows so honorable a designation on those who aim at goodness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(134)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que nul n’osoit parler de leurs vices, et les condamner</span>;” — “that none dared to speak of their vices, or to condemn them.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(135)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lesquels ne vont point rondement, et n’ont une affection droite</span>;” — “who do not go straight forward, and have not an upright disposition.” </p></div></div>
