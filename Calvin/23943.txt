<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Blind guides. </em>This is s proverbial saying, by which he beautifully describes the affected scrupulousness of hypocrites about trifling matters; for they utterly shrink from very small faults, as if a single transgression appeared to them more revolting than a hundred deaths, and yet they freely permit themselves and others to commit the most heinous crimes. They act as absurdly as if a man were to <em>strain out </em>a small crumb of bread, and to swallow a whole loaf. </p><p><em>Straining out </em><span class="cite-ref">(101)</span><em>a gnat, and swallowing a camel. </em>We know that <em>a gnat </em>is a very small animal, and that <em>a camel </em>is a huge beast. Nothing therefore could be more ridiculous than to <em>strain out </em>the wine or the water, so as not to hurt the jaws by swallowing <em>a gnat, </em>and yet carelessly to gulp down a <em>camel. </em><span class="cite-ref">(102)</span> But it is evident that hypocrites amuse themselves with such distinctions; for while they pass by <em>judgment, mercy, and faith, </em>and even tear in pieces the whole Law, they are excessively rigid and severe in matters that are of no great importance; and while in this way they pretend to kiss the feet of God, they proudly spit in his face. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span> In rendering the words, <span class="lang el-gr">οἱ διυλιζοντες τὸυ κύνωπα</span>, <em>Campbell </em>resorts to a circumlocution, who strain your liquor, to avoid swallowing a gnat; and he adds the following note:— E.T. Who strain at a gnat. I do not understand the import of this expression. Some have thought that it has sprung originally from a mere typographical error of some printer, who has made it strain at, instead of strain out.” — The conjecture mentioned by <em>Campbell </em>is strongly confirmed by the earlier English versions. “Blinde leders; clensenge a gnat, but swolowynge a camel.” — (Wyclif, 1380.) “Ye blinde gydes, which strayne out a gnat, and swalowe a cammyll.” — (Tyndale, 1534.) “Ye blynde gydes, which strayne out a gnat, and swalowe a camell.” — (Cranmer, 1539.) “Ye blynde gydes, which strayne out a gnate, and swalow a cammel.” — (Geneva, 1557.) “Blinde guides, that strain a gnat, and swallow a camel.” — (Rheims, 1582.) The coincidence of those versions in supporting the true reading is very remarkable, and the substitution of at for out is more likely to have been the effect of accident than of design. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(102)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et cependant ne faire point de difficulté d’engloutir un chameau tout entier</span>;” — “and yet make no difficulty about swallowing a whole camel.” </p></div></div>
