<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>This Jesus </em>After that he had proved by the testimony of David, that it was most requisite that Christ should rise again, he saith, that he and the rest of his fellows were such witnesses as saw him with their eyes after his resurrection. For this text <span class="cite-ref">(124)</span> will not suffer this word <em>raised up </em>to be drawn into any other sense. Whereupon it followeth that that was fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth which David did foreshow concerning Christ. After that he intreateth of the fruit or effect. For it was requisite for him to declare that first, that Christ is alive. Otherwise it had been an absurd and incredible thing that he should be the author of so great a miracle. Notwithstanding he doth therewithal teach us, that he did not rise for his own sake alone, but that he might make the whole Church partaker of his life, having poured out the Spirit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(124)</span> “Contextus,” context. </p></div></div>
