<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Whose winnowing-fan is in his hand </em>In the former verse, John preached concerning the grace of Christ, that the Jews might yield themselves to him to be renewed: now he discourses of judgment, that he may strike despisers with terror. As there are always many hypocrites who proudly reject the grace of Christ offered to them, it is also necessary to denounce the judgment that awaits them. For this reason John here describes Christ as a severe judge against unbelievers. And this is an order which must be observed by us in teaching, that hypocrites may know, that their rejection of Christ will not go unpunished. They will thus be roused from their lethargy, and begin to dread him as an avenger, whom they despised as the author of salvation. </p><p>I have no doubt, that John intended also to show, what Christ accomplishes by means of his Gospel. The preaching of the Gospel, then, is the <em>winnowing-fan </em>Before the Lord <em>sifts </em>us, the whole world is involved in confusion, every one flatters himself, and the good are mixed with the bad in short, it is only necessary that the <em>chaff </em>be blown. But when Christ comes forward with his Gospels, — when he reproves the consciences and summons them to the tribunal of God, the <em>chaff </em>is sifted out, <span class="cite-ref">(286)</span> which formerly occupied a great part of the <em>thrashing-floor </em>It is true that, in the case of individuals, the Gospel effects a separation from the <em>chaff: </em>but in this passage, John compares the reprobate to <em>chaff, </em>and believers to <em>wheat </em>The <em>thrashing floor </em>accordingly denotes — not the world, (as some people imagine,) but the Church: for we must attend to the class of persons whom John addresses. The mere title filled the Jews with pride, <span class="cite-ref">(287)</span> but John tells them that it is foolish in them to be proud of it, because they hold but a temporary place in the Church of God, from which they are soon to be thrown out, like <em>chaff </em>from the <em>thrashing-floor</em>. In this way, he gives a rapid glance at the corrupt state in which the Church then was: for it was covered with husks, and straws, and other rubbish, but would soon be cleansed by the strong breeze of the Gospel. But how is Christ said to separate the <em>chaff </em>from the <em>wheat, </em>when he can find nothing in men but mere <em>chaff? </em>The answer is easy. The elect are formed into <em>wheat, </em><span class="cite-ref">(288)</span> and are then separated from the <em>chaff, </em>and <em>collected into the granary </em></p><p><em>He will thoroughly cleanse his thrashing-floor </em>This work was begun by Christ, and is daily going forward: but the full accomplishment of it will not be seen till the last day. This is the reason why John draws our attention to the subject. But let us remember, that believers even now enter, by hope, into the <em>granary </em>of God, in which they will actually have their everlasting abode; while the reprobate experience, in their convictions of guilt, the heat of that <em>fire, </em>the actual <em>burning </em>of which they will feel at the last day. </p><p>Many persons, I am aware, have entered into ingenious debates about the eternal <em>fire, </em>by which the wicked will be tormented after the judgment. But we may conclude from many passages of Scripture, that it is a metaphorical expression. For, if we must believe that it is real, or what they call material <em>fire, </em>we must also believe that the <em>brimstone </em>and the <em>fan </em>are material, both of them being mentioned by Isaiah. </p><p>“For Tophet is ordained of old; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_30:33</span>.) </p><p>We must explain the fire in the same manner as the <em>worm, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mar_9:44</span>.) and if it is universally agreed that the <em>worm </em>is a metaphorical term, we must form the same opinion as to the fire. Let us lay aside the speculations, by which foolish men weary themselves to no purpose, and satisfy ourselves with believing, that these forms of speech denote, in a manner suited to our feeble capacity, a dreadful torment, which no man can now comprehend, and no language can express. </p><p><strong>(286)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les pailles s'en vont avec le vent</span>;” — “the chaff goes away with the wind.” </p><p><strong>(287)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les Juifs s'arrestoyent a ce beau titre de Peuple de Dieu, et d'En-fans d'Abraham, et s'en enfioyent</span>.” — “The Jews dwelt upon this fine title of People of God, and Children of Abraham, and were proud of it.” </p><p><strong>(288)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les esleus, qui de leur nature ne sont que </span><em class="lang fr-fr">paille, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">deviennent </span><em class="lang fr-fr">froment </em><span class="lang fr-fr">par la grace de Dieu</span>.” — “The elect, who by their nature are only <em>chaff; </em>become <em>wheat </em>by the grace of God.” </p></div>
