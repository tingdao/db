<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30</strong><em>The mouth of the righteous will speak wisdom </em>As it is customary with hypocrites confidently to draw to their own advantage whatever the Spirit of God declares concerning the just and upright, David here gives a definition of the righteousness which God requires on the part of his children, and divides it into three principal parts — that their speech should be in sincerity and truth; that the law of God should reign in their heart; and that they should order their conversation aright. Some give a different exposition of the first part from what we have given: they say that the righteous serve as teachers and guides, by instructing others to live well, and leading them in the way; and, therefore, <em>to speak wisdom, </em>and <em>to utter judgment, </em>is, in their view, of the same import as to instruct others in holy doctrine, and to train them to the fear of God. I do not altogether disapprove of this exposition, but I fear it is too restricted. Wisdom and uprightness are here opposed as much to the profane and filthy language by which the wicked endeavor to blot out the name of God, as to cunning and fraud, and every species of stratagem and deceit; and also to the threats and terrors by which they endeavor to frighten the simple. <span class="cite-ref">(43)</span> The meaning therefore is, first, that the righteous speak honourably and reverently of the righteousness of God, that they may cherish in themselves and others, to a large extent, the knowledge and the fear of God; <span class="cite-ref">(44)</span> secondly, that both in their own affairs and those of others, they approve, without disguise or deceit, of what is just and reasonable, and are not given to justify what is wrong under the color and varnish of sophistry; and, finally, that they never depart from the truth. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(43)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par lesquelles ils taschent d’espouvanter les simples</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(44)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En toutes les parties de la cognoissance et crainte de Dieu</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
