<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And he provided the first part for himself. </em><span class="cite-ref">(322)</span> Others translate it not badly, <em>the first-fruits. </em>Jerome’s rendering, <em>pre-eminence </em>(<em>principatum</em>,) however, is quite out of the question. The word <em>beginning </em>(<em>principium</em>, <em>) </em>however, is very suitable, for Moses thus signifies that the Gadites were beforehand in seeking a dwelling-place for themselves; for before possession of the land was accorded to the people, they asked for the kingdom of Sihon for themselves. It is afterwards added, in what way they were provident in choosing their abode, namely, because God suggested to them that Moses was at liberty to assign this portion to them. For it is called the “portion of the lawgiver,” as being that respecting which Moses might lawfully decide, since he appropriated it to the Gadites, not by hazard, nor otherwise than by God’s command. It is called the <em>hidden </em>portion, <span class="cite-ref">(323)</span> as not having been included by God in His promise. The sum is, that although God’s will was not yet revealed, with respect to this addition to the land, still they obtained it through His secret liberality. And Moses desires flint his decision with regard to the Gadites remaining on this side Jordan should be thus confirmed, since disputes might have otherwise arisen, inasmuch as God’s promise had assigned the boundaries of the whole people on the opposite bank. Theirs is a poor exposition who explain it that Moses was buried there; and those also violently wrest the words, who understand by “the lawgiver” the chiefs of the Amorites, and render the words “hidden portion,” <em>the ceiled palaces; </em><span class="cite-ref">(324)</span> nor would they have been thus extravagant in their notions, if the natural meaning which I have given had occurred to them. </p><p>The other clause of the verse is added by way of qualification; for Moses shows that this advantageous provision was made for the children of Gad, on condition that they should accompany the other tribes, and not return home until the land of Canaan was at peace, and their enemies subdued. And we have already seen that, when they sought for themselves this location outside the land, in the kingdom of the Amorites, they were severely rebuked by Moses, until they promised that they would share the war with their brethren until its conclusion. This is what Moses means by “executing the justice of God, and his judgments with Israel;” not only because it was but just that they should share the war with their brethren, and assist them in obtaining possession of the land, but because God ordained that His just vengeance should be executed upon those heathen and wicked nations by the whole of Israel, and had chosen all the tribes generally to be the ministers of His judgment; as it is said, in <span class="bvs">Psa_149:7</span>, that they were charged “to execute vengeance upon the heathen, to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written;” for it was no common honor to be appointed to be, as it were, the judges of the ungodly, so as to destroy them all, and thus to purify the land. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(322)</span><em>Lat., </em>“And he saw the beginning <em>(principium) </em>for himself,” etc. <em>Heb. </em><span class="lang he-il">וירא ראשית</span></p><p><span class="cite-note">(323)</span><em>A.
