<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>132.</strong><em>Look upon me, and be merciful to me</em>. In this verse he beseeches God to have a regard to him: as he is accustomed always to look to those who are his people. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">משפט</span><em>mishpat, </em>translated <em>judgment, </em>signifies in this passage, as in many others, <em>a common rule, </em>or <em>ordinary usage. </em><span class="cite-ref">(12)</span> He next adds the purpose for which he desires that God would look upon him, namely, that he may be relieved from his miseries. This, then, is the prayer of an afflicted man, who, when apparently destitute of all help, and unable to come to any other conclusion than that he is neglected and forsaken of God, yet reflects with himself, that, for God to forsake him, was foreign to his nature and to his usual manner of procedure. It is as if he had said — Although I can perceive no token of thy favor, yea, although my condition is so wretched and desperate, that, judging according to sense and reason, I deem that thou hast turned the back: upon me; yet, as from the beginning of the world to the present day, thou hast testified, by numberless proofs, that thou art merciful to thy servants, I beseech time that, acting according to this rule, thou wouldst now exercise the like loving-kindness towards me. It is to be particularly noticed, lest those whom God does not immediately answer may become discouraged, that the Prophet had been long oppressed by miseries, without any prospect of relief. Yet it is at the same time to be observed, that the Prophets sole ground of confidence in asking this from God is his free goodness. Whence we gather that, although he was a man of eminent sanctity, yet the undeserved grace of God was his only refuge. With respect to the word<em>judgment, </em>let us learn from the Prophet’s example to acquaint ourselves with the nature of God, from the various experiences we have had of it that we may have certain evidence that he is merciful to us. And, in truth, were not his grace known to us from the daily experience we have of it, which of us would dare to approach him? But if our eyes are not blind, we must perceive the very clear testimonies by which he fortifies our faith, so that we need not doubt that all the godly are the objects of his regard; only we must endeavor to be among the number of those <em>who love his name. </em>By this title is meant genuine believers; for those who only slavishly fear God are not worthy of being reckoned among his servants. He requires a voluntary obedience from us, so that nothing may be more delightful to us than to follow whithersoever he calls us. It is, however, at the same time to be observed, that this love proceeds from faith; yea, the Prophet here commends the grand effect of faith, by separating the godly, who lean upon the grace of God, from worldly men, who, having given their hearts to the enticements of the world, never lift up their minds towards heaven. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(12)</span> “<em>According to the custom, or usual mode of acting. </em>So Luther —<em>as thou art accustomed to do, </em>etc. In <span class="bvs">Gen_40:13</span> — ‘Thou shalt deliver the cup, <span class="lang he-il">כמשפט</span>, <em>according to custom. </em>’”—<em>Phillips. </em></p></div></div>
