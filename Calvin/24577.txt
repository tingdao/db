<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_9:38</span><strong>.</strong><em>Master, we saw one. </em>Hence it is evident that the <em>name </em>of Christ was at that time so celebrated, that persons who were not of the number of his intimate disciples used that <em>name</em>, or perhaps even abused it, for I will not venture to avouch any thing on this point as certain. It is possible that he who is here mentioned had embraced the doctrine of Christ, and betaken himself to the performance of miracles with no bad intention; but as Christ bestowed this power on none but those whom he had chosen to be heralds of his Gospel, I think that he had rashly taken, or rather seized upon, this office. Now though he was wrong in making this attempt, and in venturing to imitate the disciples without receiving a command to do so, yet his boldness was not without success: for the Lord was pleased, in this way also, to throw luster around his name, <span class="cite-ref">(585)</span> as he sometimes does by means of those of whose ministry he does not approve as lawful. It is not inconsistent with this to say, that one who was endued with special faith followed a blind impulse, and thus proceeded inconsiderately to work miracles. </p><p>I now come to <em>John </em>and his companions. They say that they <em>forbade </em>a man to <em>work miracles </em>Why did they not first ask whether or not he was authorized? For now being in a state of doubt and suspense, they ask the opinion of their Master. Hence it follows, that they had rashly taken on themselves the right to <em>forbid</em>; and therefore every man who undertakes more than he knows that he is permitted to do by the word of God is chargeable with rashness. Besides, there is reason to suspect the disciples of Christ of ambition, because they are anxious to maintain their privilege and honor. For how comes it that they all at once <em>forbid a </em>man who is unknown to them to work miracles, but because they wish to be the sole possessors of this right? For they assign the reason, that he <em>followeth not </em>Christ; as much as to say, “He is not one of thy associates, as we are: why then shall he possess equal honor?” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(585)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour avancer la gloire de son nom</span>;” — “to advance the glory of his name.” </p></div></div>
