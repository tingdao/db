<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>As the Son of man </em>Christ confirms the preceding doctrine by his own example; for he voluntarily <em>took upon himself the form of a servant</em>, <em>and emptied himself</em>, as Paul also informs us, (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>.) To prove more clearly how far he was from indulging in lofty views, he reminds them of his death. “Because I have chosen you to the honor of being near me, you are seized by a wicked ambition to reign. But I — by whose example you ought to regulate your life — came not to exalt myself, or to claim any royal dignity. On the contrary, I took upon me, along with the mean and despised form of the flesh, the ignominy of the cross. If it be objected, that Christ was: </p><p>exalted by the Father, in order that every knee might bow to him, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Phi_2:9</span>,) </p><p>it is easy to reply, that what he now says refers to the period of his humiliation. Accordingly, Luke adds, that he lived among them, <em>as if he were a servant: </em>not that in appearance, or in name, or in reality, he was inferior to them, (for he always wished to be acknowledged as their Master and Lord,) but because from the heavenly glory he descended to such meekness, that he submitted to bear their infirmities. Besides, it ought to be remembered that a comparison is here made between the greater and the less, as in that passage, </p><p>If I, who am your Master and Lord, have washed your feet, much more ought you to perform this service to one another, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_13:14</span>.) </p><p><em>And to give his life a ransom for many. </em>Christ mentioned his death, as we have said, in order to withdraw his disciples from the foolish imagination of an earthly kingdom. But it is a just and appropriate statement of its power and results, when he declares that his life is the price of our redemption; whence it follows, that we obtain an undeserved reconciliation with God, the price of which is to be found nowhere else than in the death of Christ. Wherefore, this single word overturns all the idle talk of the Papists about their abominable <em>satisfactions </em>Again, while Christ has purchased us by his death to be his property, this submission, of which he speaks, is so far from diminishing his boundless glory, that it greatly increases its splendor. The word <em>many </em>( <span class="lang el-gr">πολλῶν</span>) is not put definitely for a fixed number, but for a large number; for he contrasts himself with all others. <span class="cite-ref">(667)</span> And in this sense it is used in <span class="bvs">Rom_5:15</span>, where Paul does not speak of any part of men, but embraces the whole human race. </p><p><strong>(667)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il prend PLUSIEURS, non pas pour quelque certain nombre, mais pour les autres: car il fait une comparaison de sa personne a tout le reste des hommes</span>;” — “He takes MANY, not for any fixed number, but for the others; for he makes a comparison of his person with all the rest of men.” </p></div>
