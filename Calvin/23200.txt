<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_3:7</span><strong>.</strong><em>And when he saw many of the Pharisees. </em>It is here related by Matthew and Luke, that John did not merely preach repentance in a general manner, but that he also applied his discourse to individuals. And the manner of teaching will, in point of fact, be very unprofitable, if instructors do not judiciously inquire what the season demands, and what belongs to individuals. Nothing can be more unequal, in this respect, than a constant equality. <span class="cite-ref">(261)</span> For this reason John, we are told, addressed the Pharisees and Sadducees with greater severity: because he saw that their hypocrisy, and swelling pride, rendered them liable to be more severely censured than the common people. To comprehend more fully his design, we must understand, that none are more stupid than hypocrites, who deceive themselves and others by the outward mask of holiness. While God thunders, on all sides, against the whole world, they construct a refuge for themselves in their own deceitful fancy; for they are convinced that they have nothing to do with the judgment of God. Does any one suppose, that John acted improperly, in treating them with so much harshness at the first interview? I reply: They were not unknown to him, <span class="cite-ref">(262)</span> and the knowledge he had of them was derived, not from acquaintance or experience, but, on the contrary, from a secret revelation of the Spirit. It was therefore necessary that he should not spare them, lest they might return home more inflated with pride. Is it again objected, that they ought not to have been terrified by such severity of reproof, because they made a profession, in baptism, that they would afterwards be different persons from what they had formerly been? The reply is still easy. Those whose habits of uttering falsehood to God, and of deceiving themselves, lead them to hold out hypocrisy and pretension, instead of the reality, ought to be urged, with greater sharpness than other men, to true repentance. There is an astonishing pertinacity, as I have said, in hypocrites; and, until they have been flayed by violence, they obstinately keep their skin. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(261)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et n' y a rien plus inegal en cest endroit, que de vouloir garder tousjours une mesme egalite</span>.” — “And nothing is more unequal, in this respect, than to wish to maintain always one uniform equality. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(262)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Je res ond uil co oissoit bien quelles gens c’estoyent</span>.” — “I reply, that he knew well what sort of people they were.” </p></div></div>
