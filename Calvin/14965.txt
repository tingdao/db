<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>As for me, I am poor and sorrowful. </em><span class="cite-ref">(97)</span> From this verse we perceive more distinctly how David cast away from him the swelling and raging passion of those who, with ungovernable fury, pour forth imprecation and vengeance. He here, without doubt, offers himself to God with the sacrifice of a broken and humble heart, that by this meekness of spirit he may obtain favor with him. He therefore adds immediately after, <em>Thy salvation shall exalt me. </em>Those assuredly who are impelled to avenge themselves by their own ungovernable spirits are so far from being humbled, that they exalt themselves to a position to which they are not entitled. There is here a mutual relation stated between the sorrow with which he was oppressed, and the help of God by which he hoped to be lifted up. At the same time, he assures himself that the very thing which others considered as a ground for despair, would prove to him the cause of his salvation. This sentence might also be explained adversatively thus: Although I now mourn under the pressure of affliction, yet shall thy salvation, O Lord! exalt me. But for my part, I consider it certain that David brings forward his own affliction as a plea for obtaining mercy at the hand of God. Nor does he say simply that he will be raised up, but he expressly speaks of <em>being exalted; </em>and in this he alludes to fortresses which are set upon high places; for this is the proper signification of the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שגב</span>,<em>sagab, </em>here employed. </p><p><strong>(97)</strong> Boothroyd reads, “humbled and afflicted!” </p></div>
