<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Which have indeed a show. </em>Here we have the anticipation of an objection, in which, while he concedes to his adversaries what they allege, he at the same time reckons it wholly worthless. For it is as though he had said, that he does not regard their having a<em>show of wisdom</em>. But <em>show </em>is placed in contrast with <em>reality</em>, for it is an <em>appearance</em>, as they commonly speak, which deceives by resemblance. <span class="cite-ref">(420)</span></p><p>Observe, however, of what colors this <em>show </em>consists, according to Paul. He makes mention of three — self-invented worship, <span class="cite-ref">(421)</span> humility, and neglect of the body. Superstition among the Greeks receives the name of <span class="lang el-gr">ἐθελοβρησκεία</span> — the term which Paul here makes use of. He has, however, an eye to the etymology of the term, for <span class="lang el-gr">ἐθελοβρησκεία</span> literally denotes a voluntary service, which men choose for themselves at their own option, without authority from God. Human traditions, therefore, are agreeable to us on this account, that they are in accordance with our understanding, for any one will find in his own brain the first outlines of them. This is the <em>first </em>pretext. </p><p>The <em>second </em>is humility, inasmuch as obedience both to God and men is pretended, so that men do not refuse even unreasonable burdens. <span class="cite-ref">(422)</span> And for the most part traditions of this kind are of such a nature as to appear to be admirable exercises of humility. </p><p>They allure, also, by means of a <em>third </em>pretext, inasmuch as they seem to be of the greatest avail for the mortification of the flesh, while there is no sparing of the body. Paul, however, bids farewell to those disguises, for </p><p>what is in high esteem among men is often an abomination in the sight of God. (<span class="bvs">Luk_16:15</span>.) </p><p>Farther, <em>that </em>is a treacherous obedience, and a perverse and sacrilegious humility, which transfers to men the authority of God; and <em>neglect of the body </em>is not of so great importance, as to be worthy to be set forth to admiration as the service of God. </p><p>Some one, however, will feel astonished, that Paul does not take more pains in pulling off those masks. I answer, that he on good grounds rests contented with the simple term <em>show</em>. For the principles which he had taken as opposed to this are incontrovertible — that the body is in Christ, and that, consequently, those do nothing but impose upon miserable men, who set before them shadows. <em>Secondly</em>, the spiritual kingdom of Christ is by no means taken up with frail and corruptible elements. <em>Thirdly</em>, by the death of Christ such observances were put an end to, that we might have no connection with them; and, <em>fourthly</em>, God is our only <em>Lawgiver</em>. (<span class="bvs">Isa_33:22</span>.) Whatever may be brought forward on the other side, let it have ever so much splendor, is fleeting <em>show</em>. </p><p><em>Secondly</em>, he reckoned it enough to admonish the Colossians, not to be deceived by the putting forth of empty things. There was no necessity for dwelling at greater length in reproving them. For it should be a settled point among all the pious, that the worship of God ought not to be measured according to our views; and that, consequently, any kind of service is not lawful, simply on the ground that it is agreeable to us. This, also, ought to be a commonly received point — that we owe to God such humility as to yield obedience simply to his commands, so as not to <em>lean to our own understanding</em>, etc., (<span class="bvs">Pro_3:5</span>,) — and that the limit of humility towards men is this — that each one submit himself to others in love. Now, when they contend that the wantonness of the flesh is repressed by abstinence from meats, the answer is easy — that we must not therefore abstain from any particular food as being unclean, but must eat sparingly of what we do eat of, both in order that we may soberly and temperately make use of the gifts of God, and that we may not, impeded by too much food and drink, forget those things that are God’s. Hence it was enough to say that these <span class="cite-ref">(423)</span> were masks, that the Colossians, being warned, might be on their guard against false pretexts. </p><p>Thus, at the present day, Papists are not in want of specious pretexts, by which to set forth their own laws, however they may be — some of them impious and tyrannical, and others of them silly and trifling. When, however, we have granted them everything, there remains, nevertheless, this refutation by Paul, which is of itself more than sufficient for dispelling all their smoky vapours; <span class="cite-ref">(424)</span> not to say how far removed they <span class="cite-ref">(425)</span> are from so honorable an appearance as that which Paul describes. The principal holiness of the Papacy, <span class="cite-ref">(426)</span> at the present day, consists in monkhood, and of what nature that is, I am ashamed and grieved to make mention, lest I should stir up so abominable an odour. Farther, it is of importance to consider here, how prone, nay, how forward the mind of man is to artificial modes of worship. For the Apostle here graphically describes <span class="cite-ref">(427)</span> the state of the old system of monkhood, which came into use a hundred years after his death, as though he had never spoken a word. The zeal of men, therefore, for superstition is surpassingly mad, which could not be restrained by so plain a declaration of God from breaking forth, as historical records testify. </p><p><em>Not in any honor. Honor </em>means <em>care</em>, according to the usage of the Hebrew tongue. <em>Honour widows</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Ti_5:3</span>,) that is, take care of them. Now Paul finds fault with this, that they <span class="cite-ref">(428)</span> teach to leave off care for the body. For as God forbids us to indulge the body unduly, so he commands that these be given it as much as is necessary for it. Hence Paul, in <span class="bvs">Rom_13:14</span>, does not expressly condemn care for the flesh, but such as indulges lusts. <em>Have no care</em>, says he, <em>for the flesh, to the gratifying of its lusts. </em>What, then, does Paul point out as faulty in those traditions of which he treats? It is that they gave no honor to the body for the <em>satisfying the flesh</em>, that is, according to the measure of necessity. For <em>satisfying </em>here means a mediocrity, which restricts itself to the simple use of nature, and thus stands in opposition to pleasure and all superfluous delicacies; for nature is content with little. Hence, to refuse what it requires for sustaining the necessity of life, is not less at variance with piety, than it is inhuman. </p><p><strong>(420)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par similitude qu’elle ha auec la verite</span>;” — “By the resemblance which it bears to the reality.” </p><p><strong>(421)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le seruice forgé a plaisir, c’est a dire inuenté par les hommes</span>;” — “Worship contrived at pleasure, that is to say, invented by men.” </p><p><strong>(422)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Iniques et dures a porter</span>;” — “Unreasonable and hard to be borne.” </p><p><strong>(423)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ces traditions</span>;” — “These traditions.” </p><p><strong>(424)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tous les brouillars desquels ils taschent d’esblouir les yeux au poure monde</span>;” — “All the mists by which they endeavor to blind the eyes of the poor world.” </p><p><strong>(425)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Leurs traditions</span>;” — “Their traditions.” </p><p><strong>(426)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La premiere et la principale honnestete et sainctete de la Papaute</span>;” — “The first and principal decency and sanctity of the Papacy.” </p><p><strong>(427)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Peind yci au vif</span>;” — “Paints here to the life.” </p><p><strong>(428)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les traditions</span>;” — “The traditions.” </p></div>
