<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21</strong><em>Prove all things</em>. As rash men and deceiving spirits frequently pass off their trifles under the name of <em>prophecy, prophecy </em>might by this means be rendered suspicious or even odious, just as many in the present day feel almost disgusted with the very name of <em>preaching</em>, as there are so many foolish and ignorant persons that from the pulpit blab out their worthless contrivances, <span class="cite-ref">(616)</span> while there are others, also, that are wicked and sacrilegious persons, who babble forth execrable blasphemies. <span class="cite-ref">(617)</span> As, therefore, through the fault of such persons it might be, that <em>prophecy </em>was regarded with disdain, nay more, was scarcely allowed to hold a place, Paul exhorts the Thessalonians to <em>prove all things</em>, meaning, that although all do not speak precisely according to set rule, we must, nevertheless, form a judgment, before any doctrine is condemned or rejected. </p><p>As to this, there is a twofold error that is wont to be fallen into, for there are some who, from having either been deceived by a false pretext of the name of God, or from their knowing that many are commonly deceived in this way, reject every kind of doctrine indiscriminately, while there are others that by a foolish credulity embrace, without distinction, everything that is presented to them in the name of God. Both of these ways are faulty, for the former class, saturated with a presumptuous prejudice of that nature, close up the way against their making progress, while the other class rashly expose themselves to all <em>winds </em>of errors. (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:14</span>.) Paul admonishes the Thessalonians to keep the middle path between these two extremes, while he prohibits them from condemning anything without first examining it; and, on the other hand, he admonishes them to exercise judgment, before receiving, what may be brought forward, as undoubted truth. And unquestionably, this respect, at least, ought to be shewn to the name of God — that we do not <em>despise prophecy</em>, which is declared to have proceeded from him. As, however, examination or discrimination ought to precede rejection, so it must, also, precede the reception of true and sound doctrine. For it does not become the pious to shew such lightness, as indiscriminately to lay hold of what is false equally with what is true. From this we infer, that they have the spirit of judgment conferred upon them by God, that they may discriminate, so as not to be imposed upon by the impostures of men. For if they were not endowed with discrimination, it were in vain that Paul said — <em>Prove: hold fast that which is good</em>. If, however, we feel that we are left destitute of the power of <em>proving </em>aright; it must be sought by us from the same Spirit, who speaks by his prophets. But the Lord declares in this place by the mouth of Paul, that the course of doctrine ought not, by any faults of mankind, or by any rashness, or ignorance, or, in fine, by any abuse, to be hindered from being always in a vigorous state in the Church. For as the abolition of prophecy is the ruin of the Church, let us allow heaven and earth to be commingled, rather than that prophecy should cease. </p><p>Paul, however, may seem here to give too great liberty in teaching, when he would have <em>all things proved; </em>for things must be heard by us, that they may be <em>proved</em>, and by this means a door would be opened to impostors for disseminating their falsehoods. I answer, that in this instance he does not by any means require that an audience should be given to false teachers, whose <em>mouth </em>he elsewhere teaches (<span class="bvs">Tit_1:11</span>) <em>must be stopped</em>, and whom he so rigidly shuts out, and does not by any means set aside the arrangement, which he elsewhere recommends so highly (<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:2</span>) in the election of teachers. As, however, so great diligence can never be exercised as that there should not sometimes be persons prophesying, who are not so well instructed as they ought to be, and that sometimes good and pious teachers fail to hit the mark, he requires such moderation on the part of believers, as, nevertheless, not to refuse to hear. For nothing is more dangerous, than that moroseness, by which every kind of doctrine is rendered disgusting to us, while we do not allow ourselves to <em>prove </em>what is right. <span class="cite-ref">(618)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(616)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Leurs speculations ridicules</span>;” — “Their ridiculous speculations.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(617)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Horribles et execrables</span>;” — “Horrible and execrable.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(618)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tellement que nostre impatience ou chagrin nous empesche d’esprouuer qui est la vraye ou la fausse</span>;” — “So that our impatience or chagrin keeps us from proving what is true or false.” </p></div></div>
