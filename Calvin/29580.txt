<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>Ye are witnesses</em>. He again calls God and them to witness, with the view of affirming his integrity, and cites, on the one hand, God as a witness of his conscience, and them, <span class="cite-ref">(532)</span> on the other hand, as witnesses of what they had known by experience. <em>How holily</em>, says he, <em>and justly</em>, that is, with how sincere a fear of God, and with what fidelity and blamelessness towards men; and thirdly, <em>unreproachably</em>, by which he means that he had given no occasion of complaint or obloquy. For the servants of Christ cannot avoid calumnies, and unfavorable reports; for being hated by the world, they must of necessity be evil-spoken of among the wicked. Hence he restricts this to <em>believers</em>, who judge uprightly and sincerely, and do not revile malignantly and groundlessly. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(532)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les Thessaloniciens</span>;” — “The Thessalonians.” </p></div></div>
