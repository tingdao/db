<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>The perverse heart shall depart from me </em>Some by <em>perverse heart </em>understand perfidious men; but this I reject as a sense too forced, and it is moreover inconsistent with the context. As David has added in the second clause by way of exposition, <em>I will not know evil, </em>he doubtless in the first protests that he will be free from all perfidiousness and wickedness. The amount is, that he will do his endeavor to keep himself from all wrong-doing, and that he will not even know what it is to do wrong to his neighbors. </p></div>
