<div class="comment-content"><p>The whole context has the same meaning, namely, that although the Israelites are deaf, yet they are compelled to attend to God’s continued threats. The Prophet therefore strikes their ears, because he was not immediately attended to, and again he speaks of the end: <em>an end is come, </em>says he, <em>an end is come </em>Here Ezekiel does not affect to use graceful figures of speech, but was rather compelled by necessity to use the repetitions which we see. For<em>the end </em>concerning which he speaks could with difficulty penetrate their minds, for they were always supposing that God could be appeased by various means. Since, therefore, they promised themselves something remaining behind, and put away from them what the Prophet taught about the end, he could not do otherwise than threaten often though he could scarcely persuade them. Hence <em>an end is come, an end is come: it has been watchful against thee: behold it is come </em>When he says <em>it has watched, </em>he signifies haste, not that God had suddenly revenged the wickedness of the ten tribes, but that he regards the torpor of those who indulged in a vain confidence and dream that God’s judgment is far distant. That diabolic proverb — “<em>Le terme vaut l’argent,” </em><span class="cite-ref">(149)</span> is still common in the mouths of many, and such impiety has been rife in all ages. When therefore God suspends his judgments, the reprobate intemperately boast themselves as if they could continue in sin with impunity. For this reason the Prophet says, <em>the end is watching </em>— <em>that </em>is, hastening — because although God had delayed he would no longer refrain from destroying the Israelites. It follows — </p><p><strong>(149)</strong> Meaning — the duration of the sinful pleasure is worth the price paid for it. </p></div>
