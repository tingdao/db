<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Hear my voice, O God! </em>He begins by saying that he prayed earnestly, and with vehemence, stating, at the same time, what rendered this necessary. The voice is heard in prayer, proportionally to the earnestness and ardor which we feel. He condescends upon the circumstances of distress in which he was presently placed, and takes notice of the dangers to which his life was exposed from enemies, with other points fitted to excite the favorable consideration of God. His praying that God would protect his life, proves that it must have been in danger at this time. In the second verse, he intimates that his enemies were numerous; and that, without divine assistance, he would be unable to sustain their attacks. Some difficulty attaches to the words, from their being susceptible of two meanings. The Hebrew term <span class="lang he-il">סוד</span><em>, sod, </em>which signifies <em>a secret, </em>is understood by some to refer here to the secret plots of the wicked, and by others, to denote their meeting together for consultation. In translating it, I have employed a word which admits of either interpretation. The term <span class="lang he-il">רגשת</span><em>, rigshath, </em>used in the second part of the verse, may also be rendered in two ways, as meaning either an <em>assembly </em>of men, or <em>noise </em>and <em>uproar. </em>It comes from <span class="lang he-il">רגש</span>, <em>ragash, </em>a root signifying <em>to make a tumult. </em>This would suggest that the word <span class="lang he-il">סוד</span><em>, sod, </em>in the former clause, might refer to the clandestine plots of the wicked, and <span class="lang he-il">רגשת</span>, <em>rigshath, </em>in the latter, to their open violence; and that David prayed to be protected, on the one hand, from the malicious purposes of his enemies, and, on the other, from the forcible measures by which they proceeded to put them into execution. But the meaning first given, and which I have adopted, seems the most simple and natural, That he solicits the compassion of God, by complaining of the number that were banded against him. Still his language implies that he looked upon the protection of heaven as amply sufficient against the greatest combination of adversaries. I may add, that there is an implied plea for strengthening his cause in prayer, in what he says of the malice and wickedness of those who were opposed to him; for the more cruel and unjust the conduct of our enemies may be, we have proportionally the better ground to believe that God will interpose in our behalf. </p></div>
