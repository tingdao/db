<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20</strong><em>For the wicked shall perish. </em>The causal particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, ki, which is here translated <em>for, </em>might also be rendered as if used adversatively by <em>but </em>or <em>although, </em>unless, perhaps, some would prefer to expound the sentence as of much higher import. But the preferable interpretation is, that there is here a contrast between the subjects spoken of, namely, that the righteous are satisfied in the time of famine, whereas the ungodly shall perish in the midst of their affluence; for, while they trust in their abundance, God brings them to nought by the use of means that are secret and hidden. In calling them the <em>enemies of Jehovah, </em>he teaches us, that they are justly overwhelmed by his vengeance, which they bring upon themselves by their own wickedness. When he says, that they <em>shall be consumed as the excellency of lambs, </em>this is understood by some to refer to the fat of them. But as <span class="lang he-il">יכר</span>, <em>yakar, </em>signifies <em>excellency, </em>as I have said elsewhere, I have no doubt that this expression denotes the very best of lambs, and such as are of extraordinary fatness: and this is very suitable to the contrast here stated. We learn from this what another prophet likewise teaches, that the ungodly are fattened for the day of slaughter; so that the more sumptuously they shall have lived, the more suddenly shall their destruction come upon them. <em>To be consumed into smoke </em>is of the same import as <em>to vanish away quickly; </em>as if it had been said, There is no stability or substance in them. Those who understand the term <span class="lang he-il">יקר</span>, <em>yakar, </em>to mean <em>fat, </em>explain this latter clause in this sense: that the wicked are consumed into smoke as fat melts or wastes away. <span class="cite-ref">(37)</span> But the reader will see that the first interpretation is better. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(37)</span> It is generally supposed that there is here an allusion to the sacrificial services of the former dispensation. Lambs were then offered in large numbers as burnt-offerings; and if the allusion is to these sacrifices, as is highly probable, the doctrine taught is, that as the fat of them melted away, and was wholly and rapidly consumed by the fire of the altar of burnt-offering, so the wicked shall melt away and be quickly consumed in the fire of Jehovah’s wrath. The Chaldee paraphrases the last clause thus: — “They shall be consumed in the smoke of Gehenna,” or of hell. </p></div></div>
