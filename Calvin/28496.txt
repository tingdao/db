<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>But if they cannot contain </em>While he advises to abstain from marriage, he always speaks conditionally — <em>if it can be done, if there is ability</em>; but where the infirmity of the flesh does not allow of that liberty, he expressly enjoins marriage as a thing that is not in the least doubtful. For this is said <em>by way of commandment</em>, that no one may look upon it as mere advice. Nor is it merely fornicators that he restrains, but those also who are defiled in the sight of God by inward lust; and assuredly he that <em>cannot contain </em>tempts God, if he neglects the remedy of marriage. This matter requires — not advice, but strict prohibition. </p><p><em>For it is better </em>There is not strictly a comparison here, inasmuch as lawful <em>marriage is honorable in all things</em>, (<span class="bvs">Heb_13:4</span>,) but, on the other hand, <em>to burn </em>is a thing that is exceedingly wrong. The Apostle, however, has made use of a customary form of expression, though not strictly accurate, as we commonly say: “It is better to renounce this world that we may, along with Christ, enjoy the inheritance of the heavenly kingdom, than to perish miserably in carnal delights.” I mention this, because Jerome constructs upon this passage a childish sophism <span class="cite-ref">(396)</span> — that marriage is good, inasmuch as it is not so great an evil as <em>to burn </em>I would say, if it were a matter of sport, that he foolishly amuses himself, but in a matter so weighty and serious, it is an impious scoff, unworthy of a man of judgment. Let it then be understood, that marriage is a good and salutary remedy, because <em>to burn </em>is a most base abomination in the sight of God. We must, however, define what is meant by <em>burning</em>; for many are stung with fleshly desires, who, nevertheless, do not require forthwith to have recourse to marriage. And to retain Paul’s metaphor, it is one thing <em>to burn </em>and another to feel heat. Hence what Paul here calls <em>burning</em>, is not a mere slight feeling, but a boiling with lust, so that you cannot resist. As, however, some flatter themselves in vain, by imagining that they are entirely free from blame, if they do not yield assent to impure desire, observe that there are three successive steps of temptation. For in some cases the assaults of impure desire have so much power that the will is overcome: <em>that </em>is the worst kind of <em>burning</em>, when the heart is inflamed with lust. In some instances, while we are stung with the darts of the flesh, it is in such a manner that we make a stout resistance, and do not allow ourselves to be divested of the true love of chastity, but on the contrary, abhor all base and filthy affections. </p><p>Hence all must be admonished, but especially the young, that whenever they are assailed by their fleshly inclinations, they should place the fear of God in opposition to a temptation of this sort, cut off all inlets to unchaste thoughts, entreat the Lord to give them strength to resist, and set themselves with all their might to extinguish the flames of lust. If they succeed in this struggle, let them render thanks unto the Lord, for where shall we find the man who does not experience some molestation from his flesh? but if we bridle its violence, before it has acquired the mastery, it is well. For we do not <em>burn</em>, though we should feel a disagreeable heat — not that there is nothing wrong in that feeling of heat, but acknowledging before the Lord, with humility and sighing, <span class="cite-ref">(397)</span> our weakness, we are meanwhile, nevertheless, of good courage. To sum up all, so long as we come off victorious in the conflict, through the Lord’s grace, and Satan’s darts do not make their way within, but are valiantly repelled by us, let us not become weary of the conflict. </p><p>There is an intermediate kind of temptation <span class="cite-ref">(398)</span> — when a man does not indeed admit impure desire with the full assent of his mind, but at the same time is inflamed with a blind impetuosity, and is harassed in such a manner that he cannot with peace of conscience call upon God. A temptation, then, of such a kind as hinders one from calling upon God in purity, and disturbs peace of conscience, is <em>burning</em>, such as cannot be extinguished except by marriage. We now see, that in deliberating as to this, one must not merely consider whether he can preserve his body free from pollution: the mind also must be looked to, as we shall see in a little. </p><p><strong>(396)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vn sophisme plus que puerile</span>;” — “A worse than childish sophism.” </p><p><strong>(397)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Auee pleurs et humilite</span>;” — “With tears and humility.” </p><p><strong>(398)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il y a vne autre espece de tentation moyenne entre les deux que i’ay dites</span>;” — “There is another kind of temptation, intermediate between the two, that I have mentioned.” </p></div>
