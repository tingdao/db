<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_22:31</span><strong>.</strong><em>Lo</em>, <em>Satan hath desired. </em>The other two Evangelists relate more briefly and simply, that our Lord foretold to his disciples their fall. But the words of Luke contain more abundant instruction; for Christ does not speak of the future trouble in the way of narrative, but expressly declares, that they will have a contest with <em>Satan, </em>and, at the same <em>time, </em>promises to them victory. It is a highly useful admonition, whenever we meet with any thing that gives us offense, to have always before our eyes the snares of <em>Satan; </em>as Paul also teaches, that </p><p>we wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with spiritual armies, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Eph_6:12</span>.) </p><p>The meaning of the words therefore is: “When, a short time hence, you shall see me oppressed, know that <em>Satan </em>employs these arms to fight against you, and that this is a convenient opportunity for destroying your faith.” I have said that this is a useful doctrine, because it frequently happens that, from want of consideration, we are overcome by disregarding temptations, which we would regard as formidable, if we reflected that they are <em>the fiery darts </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_6:16</span>) of a vigorous and powerful enemy. And though he now speaks of that singularly fierce attack, by which the disciples, at one time, received dreadful shocks, so that their faith was well nigh extinguished, yet he manifestly conveys a more extensive doctrine, that <em>Satan </em>continually goes about, roaring for his prey. As he is impelled by such furious madness to destroy us, nothing is more unreasonable than that we should give ourselves up to drowsiness. Before there is apparent necessity for fighting, let us already prepare ourselves; for we know that <em>Satan </em>desires our destruction, and with great skill and assiduity seizes on every method of injuring us. And when we come to the conflict, let us know that all temptations, from whatever quarter they come, were forged in the workshop of that enemy. </p><p><em>That he may sift you as wheat. </em>The metaphor of <em>sifting </em>is not in every respect applicable; for we have elsewhere seen that the Gospel is compared to a <em>winnowing-fan </em>or <em>sieve, </em>by which the <em>wheat </em>is purified from the <em>chaff </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_3:12</span>;) but here it simply means to toss up and down, or to shake with violence, because the apostles were driven about with unusual severity by the death of Christ. This ought to be understood, because there is nothing in which Satan takes less delight than the <em>purification </em>of believers. Yet though it be for a different purpose that he shakes them, it is nevertheless true, that they are driven and tossed about in every direction, just as the <em>wheat </em>is shaken by the <em>winnowing-fan. </em>But we shall shortly afterwards see that a still more disastrous fulfillment of these words was experienced by the disciples. And this is what is meant by the words of our Lord, as related by Matthew and Mark: <em>you will all be offended at me. </em>They mean that the disciples will not only be attacked, but will nearly give way; because the ignominious treatment of Christ will quite overpower their minds. For whereas it was their duty to advance steadily with their Master to the cross, fear kept them back. Their infirmity is thus exhibited to them, that by prayers and groans they may betake themselves to God’s holy protection. </p></div>
