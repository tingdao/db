<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>About the sixth hour. </em>The Evangelists appear to differ, and even to contradict each other, in the computation of time. The other three Evangelists say that <em>the darkness </em>came on <em>about the sixth hour, </em>while Christ was hanging on the cross, (<span class="bvs">Mat_27:45</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_15:33</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_23:44</span>.) Mark, too says expressly that it was <em>the third hour </em>when the sentence was pronounced on him, (<span class="bvs">Mar_15:25</span>.) But this may be easily explained. It is plain enough from other passages that the day was at that time divided into four parts, as the night also contained four watches; in consequence of which, the Evangelists sometimes allot not more than four hours to each day, and extend each hour to three, and, at the same time, reckon the space of an hour, which was drawing to a close, as belonging to the next part. According to this calculation, <em>John </em>relates that Christ was condemned <em>about the sixth hour, </em>because the time of the day was drawing towards <em>the sixth hour, </em>or towards the second part of the day. Hence we infer that Christ was crucified at or about <em>the sixth hour; </em>for, as the Evangelist afterwards mentions, (<span class="bvs">Joh_19:20</span>,) <em>the place was near to the city. The darkness </em>began between the sixth and ninth hour, and lasted till the ninth hour, at which time Christ died. </p></div>
