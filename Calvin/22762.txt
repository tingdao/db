<div class="comment-content"><p>Then he adds, <em>Shall it not be, behold, from Jehovah of hosts? </em><span class="cite-ref">(38)</span> Some give a wrong version, “Is not this,” as though <span class="lang he-il">הנה</span>, <em>ene</em>, were put here instead of a pronoun demonstrative; but they extenuate and obscure the beauty of the expression; nay, they pervert the meaning of the Prophet: for when he says, <span class="lang he-il">הנה</span>, <em>ene</em>, behold, he refers not to what he had said, nor specifies any particular thing, and yet he shows, as it were by the finger, the judgement of God, which he bids us to expect; as though he said, “Shall not God at length have his turn, when the avaricious and the cruel have obtained their triumphs in the world, and darkened the minds and thoughts of all, as though no account were to be given by them before the tribunal of God? Shall not God sometime show that it is his time to interpose?” When, therefore, he says, <em>Shall it not be, behold, from Jehovah? </em>it is an indefinite mode of speaking; he does not say, This or that shall be from the God of hosts; but, <em>Shall it not be, behold, from Jehovah of hosts? </em>that is, God seems now indeed to rest, and on this account men indulge themselves with greater boldness; but he will not always remain still, Shall not God then come forth, who seems now to be unconcerned? Something there will at length be from the God of hosts. And the demonstrative particle confirms the same thing: <em>Behold</em>, he says, as though he would show to the faithful as in a picture the tribunal of God, which cannot be seen by us now but by faith. He says, <em>Behold, will not there be something </em>from the God of <em>hosts? </em>that is, Will not God at length stretch forth his hand, to show that he is not unconcerned, but that he cares for the affairs of men? In a word, by this mode of speaking is pointed out to us the change, which we are to hope for, inasmuch as it cannot be soon realised. </p><p>Hence he concludes, <em>The people</em>, then, <em>labor in the fire, and the people weary themselves in vain</em>. To labor in the fire means the same thing as to take in hand an unprofitable work, the fruit of which is immediately consumed. Some say that people labor in the fire, because Babylon had been built by a great number of men, and at length perished by fire; but this explanation seems far-fetched. I take a simpler view—that <em>people labor in the fire</em>, like him who performs a work, and a fire is put under it and consumes it; or like him, who with great labor polishes his own work, and a fire is prepared, which destroys it while in the hands of the artificer. For it is certain that the Prophet repeats the same thing in another form, when he says, <span class="lang he-il">בדי-ריק</span>, <em>bedi-rik</em>, with vanity, or for vanity. We now then apprehend his object. </p><p>We may here collect a useful doctrine—that not only the fruit of labor shall be lost by all who seek by wicked means to enrich themselves, but also that were the whole world favorable and subservient to them, the whole would yet be useless; as it happened to the king of Babylon, though he had many people ready to obey him. But the Prophet derides all those great preparations, for God had fire at hand to consume whatever they had so eagerly contrived who wished to spend all their labor to please one man. He at length adds— </p><p><strong>(38)</strong> The construction of the first line of this verse, as given by <em>Calvin</em>, is stiff and unnatural. There is no doubt but that [<span class="lang he-il">הנה</span> ] is a pronoun in the plural number, and so it has been taken by the Septuagint<span class="lang el-gr">, ταυτα, </span> these things, and such is the rendering of the Syriac and Arabic versions. No improvement, perhaps, can be made on <em>Newcome’s </em>rendering of this verse,— </p><p><em>Are not these things from Jehovah </em>God <em>of hosts, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>That people should labor for the fire, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And nations should weary themselves for a vain thing? </em></p><p>The intimation is, that all the buildings erected by blood and prepared by iniquity, were destined for the fire. “For the fire,” [<span class="lang he-il">בדי אש</span> ], literally is, for the supply of fire, as <em>Parkhurst </em>renders the phrase: then it is, for the supply of emptiness or vacuity, [<span class="lang he-il">ברי ריק</span> ]. </p><p>The last two lines, with some variety, are found in <span class="bvs">Jer_51:58</span>, and applied to Babylon. In Jeremiah, “for a vain thing,” is in the first line, and “for the fire” is in the second. Jeremiah puts the less evil first, and the greatest last; but Habakkuk’s usual manner is the reverse, which has been before noticed, and we find an instance in the preceding verse, where he mentions “blood” first, and in the next line, “iniquity.” </p><p>That the destination of Babylon for the fire is here meant, seems evident from the following verse. See <span class="bvs">Jer_51:25</span>.—<em>Ed. </em></p></div>
