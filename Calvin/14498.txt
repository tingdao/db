<div class="comment-content"><p>In the next verse, the word <span class="lang he-il">כסלים</span>, <em>kesalaim, </em>which I have rendered <em>reins, </em>is by some translated <em>the flanks. </em>But the more generally received opinion is, that it denotes the part under the reins, which extends towards the haunch, or the space between the thighs and flanks, where it is supposed there had been a sore. Commentators also differ in their opinion respecting the word <span class="lang he-il">נקלה</span>, <em>nikleh, </em>which I have rendered <em>burning </em>In my translation I have followed those who adhere to the original meaning of the word; for the verb <span class="lang he-il">קלה</span>, <em>kalah, </em>signifies <em>to burn, </em>or <em>to consume with fire. </em>Others, indeed, explain it not improperly in the sense <em>of filthiness and corruption. </em>I am, however, not inclined to limit it to a sore. In my opinion, the sense simply is, that his reins, or flanks, or thighs, were filled with an inflammatory disease, or at least were covered over with putrid sores; for these parts of the body are most subject to inflammation, and most liable to contract putrid humours. Some expound it allegorically, as meaning, that David seemed loathsome in his own eyes, when he thought of his reproach; but this appears too forced. When he adds that he was <em>weakened </em>and <em>sore broken, </em>he still farther confirms what he had said in the preceding verses: for by these various terms he wished to express the intolerable vehemence of his grief. Now, as a man, who is distinguished by courage, does not cry out and complain, and as we know that David did not shrink in bearing his afflictions, we may gather from this, that his sufferings were severe and painful in the extreme, inasmuch as he not only wept bitterly, but was also forced to cry out and complain. The noun <span class="lang he-il">נהמת</span>, <em>nahamath, </em>which I have rendered <em>roaring, </em>may be derived from another verb than that which David has here used; but the meaning is obvious, namely, that the incontrollable emotions of his heart forced him to cry out. </p></div>
