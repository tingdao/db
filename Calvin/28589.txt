<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Do we provoke the Lord </em>? Having laid down the doctrine, he assumes a more vehement tone, from observing, that what was a most atrocious offense against God was regarded as nothing, or, at least, was looked upon as a very trivial error. The Corinthians wished the liberty that they took to be reckoned excusable, as there is not one of us that willingly allows himself to be found fault with, but, on the contrary, we seek one subterfuge after another, under which to shelter ourselves. Now Paul says, and not without reason, that in this way we wage war against God; for nothing does God more require from us than this — that we adhere strictly to everything that he declares in his word. Do not those, then, who use subterfuges, <span class="cite-ref">(591)</span> in order that they may be at liberty to transgress the commandment of God, arm themselves openly against God? Hence that curse which the Prophet denounces against all those who call <em>evil</em>, <em>good</em>, and<em>darkness</em>, <em>light </em>(<span class="bvs">Isa_5:20</span>.) </p><p><em>Are we stronger </em>? He warns them how dangerous a thing it is to <em>provoke God </em>— because no one can do this but to his own ruin. <span class="cite-ref">(592)</span> Among men the chance of war, as they speak, is doubtful, but to contend with God is nothing short of voluntarily courting destruction. Accordingly, if we fear to have God as an enemy, let us shudder at the thought of framing excuses for manifest sins, that is, whatever stand opposed to his word. Let us, also, shudder at the thought of calling in question those things that he has himself pronounced upon — for this is nothing less than to rise up against heaven after the manner of the giants. <span class="cite-ref">(593)</span> (<span class="bvs">Gen_11:4</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(591)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui ne veulent point venir au poinet</span>;” — “Who are not willing to come to the point.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(592)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ruine et condemnation</span>;” — “Ruin and condemnation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(593)</span> The reader will find the same incident in Sacred History referred to by our Author, and dwelt upon at considerable length, in the <em>Harmony</em>, vol. 1, p. 58.
