<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>That they may show that Jehovah is upright. </em>It is evident from this verse that the great object of the Psalmist is, to allay that disquietude of mind which we are apt to feel under the disorder which reigns apparently in the affairs of this world; and to make us cherish the expectation, (under all that may seem severe and trying in our lot, and though the wicked are in wealth and power, flourish, and abound in places and distinctions,) that God will bring light and order eventually out of confusion<em>. That they may show, </em>it is said particularly, <em>that the Lord is upright; </em>for through the influence of our corruption we are apt to conclude, when things do not proceed as we would wish in the world, that God is chargeable not only with neglect but with unrighteousness, in abandoning his people, and tolerating the commission of sin. When God displays his justice in proceeding to execute vengeance upon the wicked, it will be seen at once, that any prosperity which they enjoyed was but the forerunner of a worse destruction in reserve for them. The Psalmist, in calling God <em>his rock, </em>shows a second time that he reckoned himself amongst the number of those in whom God would illustrate his justice by extending towards them his protection. </p></div>
