<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>For God has shut up, etc. </em>A remarkable conclusion, by which he shows that there is no reason why they who have a hope of salvation should despair of others; for whatever they may now be, they have been like all the rest. If they have emerged from unbelief through God’s mercy alone, they ought to leave place for it as to others also. For he makes the Jews equal in guilt with the Gentiles, that both might understand that the avenue to salvation is no less open to others than to them. For it is the mercy of God alone which saves; and this offers itself to both. This sentence then corresponds with the testimony of Hosea, which he had before quoted, “I will call those my people who were not my people.” But he does not mean, that God so blinds all men that their unbelief is to be imputed to him; but that he hath so arranged by his providence, that all should be guilty of unbelief, in order that he might have them subject to his judgment, and for this end, — that all merits being buried, salvation might proceed from his goodness alone. <span class="cite-ref">(371)</span></p><p>Paul then intends here to teach two things — that there is nothing in any man why he should be preferred to others, apart from the mere favor of God; and that God in the dispensation of his grace, is under no restraint that he should not grant it to whom he pleases. There is an emphasis in the word <em>mercy; </em>for it intimates that God is bound to none, and that he therefore saves all freely, for they are all equally lost. But extremely gross is their folly who hence conclude that all shall be saved; for Paul simply means that both Jews and Gentiles do not otherwise obtain salvation than through the mercy of God, and thus he leaves to none any reason for complaint. It is indeed true that this mercy is without any difference offered to all, but every one must seek it by faith. </p><p><strong>(371)</strong> The verb which [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] renders <em>conclusi </em><span class="lang el-gr">, συνέκλεισε </span> means to shut up together. The paraphrase of [<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>] is, that “God has proved (<span class="lang el-gr">ἤλεγξεν</span>) all to be unbelieving.” [<span class="bvs">Wolfius </span>] considers the meaning the same with <span class="bvs">Rom_3:9</span>, and with <span class="bvs">Gal_3:22</span>. God has in his providence, as well as in his word, proved and demonstrated, that all mankind are by nature in a state of unbelief and of sin and of condemnation. </p><p>God has shut up together, etc., “how?” asks [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>]; then he answers, “by manifesting, accusing, and condemning unbelief, but not by effecting or approving it.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
