<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Give us always this bread. </em>There is no doubt that they speak ironically, to accuse Christ of vain boasting, when he said that he was able to give <em>the bread of life. </em>Thus wretched men, while they reject the promises of God, are not satisfied with this evil alone, but put Christ in their room, as if he were chargeable with their unbelief. </p></div>
