But I have previously shown (what may also be elicited from the context) that his design was nothing else than to pierce their hearts more deeply. He must have anticipated great mischief, if he had perceived that they did not care for their brother: but the Lord provided against this danger, by causing the earnest apology of Judah not only to soften his mind, but even to draw forth tears and weeping in profusion. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(174)</span> “God forbid” is an expression frequently used by our translators, both in the Old and New Testament, where the name of God does not occur in the original. The term here used as the same meaning as Absit in Latin, and <span class="lang el-gr">Μὴ γένοιτο</span> in Greek. Literally this passage would read, “Far be it from me to do so.” See also <span class="bvs">Gen_44:7</span>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
