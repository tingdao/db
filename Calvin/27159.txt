<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>43.</strong><em>You took to you the tabernacle of Moloch. </em>Some take the copulative for the adversative [particle,] as if he should say, Yea, rather, ye worshipped the idol. It may be resolved also into the conjunction causal, thus, You did not offer sacrifices to me, because ye erected a tabernacle to Moloch. But I expound it somewhat otherwise, to wit, that God doth first accuse the fathers for the more vehemency; and then afterwards he addeth, that their posterity did increase the superstitions, because they gat to themselves new and diverse idols; as if the prophet had spoken thus in the person of God, If I shall rip up from the beginning, (O house of Jacob,) how your kindred hath behaved itself toward me; your fathers began to overthrow and corrupt, even in the wilderness, that worship which I had commanded; but you have far passed their ungodliness, for you have brought in an infinite company of gods. And this order is fitter for Stephen’s purpose; for he intendeth to prove, (as we have already said,) that after the Israelites felt away unto strange and bastardly rites, they never made an end of sinning, but being stricken with blindness, they polluted themselves every now and then with new idolatries, until they were come even unto the last end <span class="cite-ref">(454)</span> of impiety. Therefore, Stephen confirmeth this sentence fitly with the testimony of the prophet, that the Jews, descending of wicked and rebellious fathers, had never ceased to wax worse and worse. And although the prophet’s words be somewhat unlike to these, yet is the sense all one. It is to be thought that Stephen, who had to deal with the Jews, did repeat word for word in their tongue that which is in the prophet; Luke, who wrote in Greek, did follow the Greek interpreter. The prophet saith, Ye honored Succoth your king, and Chiun your image, the star of your gods. The Greek interpreter made a noun common of a noun proper, because of the alliance <span class="cite-ref">(455)</span> of the word <em>Succoth, </em>which signifieth<em>a tabernacle. </em>Furthermore, I cannot tell whence he fetcheth that his Remphan, unless it were because that word was more used in that time. </p><p><em>And figures which ye made. </em>The word image, which is in the prophet, doth of itself signify no evil thing. Moreover, the word [<span class="lang el-gr">τυπος</span> ]; is taken amongst the Grecians in good part. For the ceremonies which God appointed are called [<span class="lang el-gr">τυποι</span> ]; notwithstanding the prophet condemneth expressly the figures [types] which the Jews had made. Why so? Because God will not be worshipped under a visible and external form. If any man object that he speaketh in this place of stars; that is true, I confess; but I stand only upon this, that although the prophet doth give their idols some honest name, yet doth he sharply condemn their corrupt worship; whereby the foolish and childish caviling of the Papists is refuted. Because they deny that those images which they worship are idols, they say, that that mad worship of theirs is, [<span class="lang el-gr">εικονοδουλεια</span> ], or serving of images, and not [<span class="lang el-gr">ειδολοδουλεια</span> ], or worshipping of idols. Seeing they mock God sophistically, there is no man that is endued even but with common understanding, which doth not see that they are more than ridiculous even in such toys. For although I move no question about the word, it is certain that the word [<span class="lang el-gr">τυπος</span> ]; is more honorable than [<span class="lang el-gr">εικων</span> ]. But those same [<span class="lang el-gr">τυποι</span> ], or figures, are simply condemned in this place, which men make to themselves, not only [<span class="lang el-gr">προς την λατρειαν</span> ], or that they may worship them, but [<span class="lang el-gr">προς την προσκυνησιν</span> ], that is, that they may give them even any reverence at all. Therefore that filthy distinction falleth flat to the ground, wherein the Papists think they have a crafty starting-hole. <span class="cite-ref">(456)</span></p><p><em>Beyond Babylon. </em>The prophet nameth Damascus; neither doth the Greek interpretation dissent from the same. Wherefore it may be that the word Babylon cropt [crept] in here through error; though in the sum of the thing there be no great difference. The Israelites were to be carried away to Babylon; but because they thought that they had a sure and strong fortress in the kingdom of Syria, whose head Damascus was, therefore the prophet saith that Damascus shall not help them, but that God shall drive them farther; as if he should say, So long as you have Damascus set against your enemies, you think that you are well fenced; but God shall carry you away beyond it; even into Assyria and Chaldea. </p><p><strong>(454)</strong> “Ad extermum,” to the extreme. </p><p><strong>(455)</strong> “Affinitatem,” its affinity to. </p><p><strong>(456)</strong> “Effugium,” evasion. </p></div>
