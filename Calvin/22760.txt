<div class="comment-content"><p>There is here introduced by the Prophet a new personification. He had before prepared a common song, which would be in the mouth of all. He now ascribes speech to stones and wood, of which buildings are formed. <em>The stone, he says, shall cry from the wall, and the wood from the chamber</em>; that is, there is no part of the building that will not cry out that it was built by plunder, by cruelty, and, in a word, by evil deeds. The Prophet not only ascribes speech to wood and stone, but he makes them also respond one to the other as in a chorus, as in lyrics there are voices which take up the song in turns. <em>The stone, he says, shall cry from the wall, and the wood shall respond to it from the chamber</em>; <span class="cite-ref">(37)</span> as though he said, “There will be a striking harmony in every part of the building; for the wall will begin and will utter its song, ‘Behold I have been built by blood and by iniquity;’ and the wood will utter the same, and will cry, ‘Woe;’ but all in due order; there will be no confused noise, but as music has distinct sounds, so also the stones will respond to the wood and the wood to the stones, so that there may be, as they say, corresponding voices.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(37)</span> The word rendered here “Wood,” <em>lignum </em>, is [<span class="lang he-il">כפיס</span> ], and only found here. The Septuagint has<span class="lang el-gr">κανθαρος, </span> a beetle,—<em>Sym. </em>σ<span class="lang el-gr">υνδεσμος, </span> bond, tie, or joint,—<em>Theod. </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἔνδεσμος, </span> bandage or jointing. The context shows that it must be something connected with wood-building. <em>Parkhurst </em>says, that it is a verb in Syriac, and means to connect, to fasten together, and he renders it a beam or a rafter, which would exactly suit this place. The word, [<span class="lang he-il">מעף</span> ], “from the wood,” evidently means the wood-building or wood-work. So that <em>tabulatum </em>, a story or a chamber in a building, as rendered by <em>Calvin</em>, is not amiss. Perhaps the best version would be,— </p><p>And the beam from the wood-work answers it. </p><p><em>Bochart </em>says, that [<span class="lang he-il">כפיס</span> ], in Rabbinical writings, means a brick, and that it was usual, formerly, as it was in this country not long ago, to build with bricks and wood or timber together; and <em>Henderson </em>has adopted this meaning, but the other is more satisfactory.—<em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
