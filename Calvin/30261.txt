<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Now the God of peace, etc. </em>To render mutual what he desired them to do, he ends his Epistle with prayer; and he asks of God to <em>confirm, </em>or to fit, or to perfect them in <em>every good work; </em>for such is the meaning of<span class="lang el-gr">καταρτίσαι. </span> We hence conclude, that we are by no means fit to do good until we are made or formed for the purpose by God, and that we shall not continue long in doing good unless he strengthens us; for perseverance is his peculiar gift. Nor is there a doubt but that as no common gifts of the Spirit had already, as it seems, appeared in them, the first impression with which they began, is not what is prayed for, but the polishing, which they were to be made perfect. </p><p><em>That brought again from the dead, etc. </em>This clause was added for the sake of confirmation; for he intimates that God is then only prayed to aright by us, to lead us on to perfection, when we acknowledge his power in the resurrection of Christ, and acknowledge Christ himself as our pastor. He, in short, would have us to look to Christ, in order that we may rightly trust in God for help; for Christ was raised from death for this end, that we might be renewed unto eternal life, by the same power of God; and he is the great pastor of all, in order that we may protect the sheep committed to him by the Father. </p><p><em>Through the blood, etc. </em>I have rendered it, “In the blood;” for as <span class="lang he-il">ב</span> “in,” is often taken in the sense of <em>with</em>, so I prefer to regard it here. For it seems to me, that the Apostle means, that Christ so arose from the dead, that his death was not yet abolished, but that it retains its efficacy forever, as though he had said, “God raised up his own son, but in such a way that the blood he shed once for all in his death is efficacious after his resurrection for the ratification of the everlasting covenant, and brings forth fruit the same as though it were flowing always.” <span class="cite-ref">(292)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(292)</span> See Appendix H 3. </p></div></div>
