<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ. </em>But what does Paul wish for the Ephesians? <em>The spirit of wisdom, </em>and <em>the eyes of their understanding being enlightened. </em>And did they not possess these? Yes; but at the same time they needed increase, that, being endowed with a larger measure of the Spirit, and being more and more enlightened, they might more clearly and fully hold their present views. The knowledge of the godly is never so pure, but that some dimness or obscurity hangs over their spiritual vision. But let us examine the words in detail. </p><p><em>The God of our Lord Jesus Christ. </em>The Son of God became man in such a manner, that God was his God as well as ours. </p><p>“I ascend,” says he, “to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_20:17</span>) </p><p>And the reason why he is our God, is, that he is the God of Christ, whose members we are. Let us remember, however, that this relates to his human nature; so that his subjection takes nothing away from his eternal godhead. </p><p><em>The Father of glory. </em>This title springs from the former; for God’s glory, as a Father, consists in subjecting his Son to our condition, that, through him, he might be our God. <em>The Father of glory </em>is a well-known Hebrew idiom for <em>The glorious Father</em>. There is a mode of pointing and reading this passage, which I do not disapprove, and which connects the two clauses in this manner: <em>That God, the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, may give to you. </em></p><p><em>The Spirit of wisdom and revelation </em>is here put, by a figure of speech, (metonymy,) for the grace which the Lord bestows upon us by his own Spirit. But let it be observed, that the gifts of the Spirit are not the gifts of nature. Till the Lord opens them, <em>the eyes of our heart </em>are blind. Till the Spirit has become our instructor, all that we know is folly and ignorance. Till the Spirit of God has made it known to us by a secret revelation, the knowledge of our Divine calling exceeds the capacity of our own minds. </p><p><em>In the knowledge of him. </em>This might also be read, <em>In the knowledge of himself</em>. Both renderings agree well with the context, for he that knows the Son knows also the Father; but I prefer the former as more natively suggested by the Greek pronoun<span class="lang el-gr">, ἐν ἐπιγνώσει αὐτοῦ </span></p></div>
