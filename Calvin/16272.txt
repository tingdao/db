<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Grant not, O Jehovah! the desires of the wicked </em><span class="cite-ref">(228)</span> We might render the words <em>Establish not</em>, though the meaning would be the same — that God would restrain the desires of the wicked, and frustrate all their aims and attempts. We see from this that it is in his power, whenever he sees proper, to frustrate the unprincipled designs of men, and their wicked expectations, and to dash their schemes. When, therefore, it is found impracticable to bring our enemies to a right state of mind, we are to pray that the devices which they have imagined may be immediately overthrown and thwarted. In the next clause there is more ambiguity. As the Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">פוק</span>, <em>puk</em>, means to lead out, as well as to strike or fall, the words might mean, that God would not carry out into effect the counsels of the wicked. But the opinion of those may be correct who read — <em>their thought is thou wilt not strike</em>, David representing such hopes as the wicked are wont to entertain. We find him elsewhere (<span class="bvs">Psa_10:6</span>) describing their pride in a similar way, in entirely overlooking a divine providence, and considering all events as subject to their control, and the world placed under their sole management. The word which follows with thus come in appropriately — they shall be <em>lifted up</em>, in illusion to the wicked being inflated by pride, through the idea that they can never be overtaken by adversity. If the other reading be preferred, the negative particle must be considered as repeated — “Suffer not their attempts to be carried into effect; let them not be exalted.” At any rate David is to be considered as censuring the security of his enemies, in making no account of God, and in surrendering themselves to unbridled license. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(228)</span> “The desires which the wicked have for my destruction.” — <em>Phillips</em>. </p></div></div>
