<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Which are a shadow of things to come. </em>The reason why he frees Christians from the observance of them is, that they were <em>shadows </em>at a time when Christ was still, in a manner, absent. For he contrasts shadows with revelation, and absence with manifestation. Those, therefore, who still adhere to those <em>shadows</em>, act like one who should judge of a man’s appearance from his shadow, while in the mean time he had himself personally before his eyes. For Christ is now manifested to us, and hence we enjoy him as being present. <em>The body</em>, says he, <em>is of Christ</em>, that is, IN <em>Christ</em>. For the substance of those things which the ceremonies anciently prefigured is now presented before our eyes in Christ, inasmuch as he contains in himself everything that they marked out as future. Hence, the man that calls back the ceremonies into use, either buries the manifestation of Christ, or robs Christ of his excellence, and makes him in a manner void. <span class="cite-ref">(387)</span> Accordingly, should any one of mortals assume to himself in this matter the office of judge, let us not submit to him, inasmuch as Christ, the only competent Judge, sets us free. For when he says, <em>Let no man judge you</em>, he does not address the false apostles, but prohibits the Colossians from yielding their neck to unreasonable requirements. To abstain, it is true, from swine’s flesh, is in itself harmless, but the binding to do it is pernicious, because it makes void the grace of Christ. </p><p>Should any one ask, “What view, then, is to be taken of our sacraments? Do they not also represent Christ to us as absent?” I answer, that they differ widely from the ancient ceremonies. For as painters do not in the first draught bring out a likeness in vivid colors, and (<span class="lang el-gr">εἰκονικῶς</span>) <em>expressively</em>, but in the first instance draw rude and obscure lines with charcoal, so the representation of Christ under the law was unpolished, and was, as it were, a first sketch, but in our sacraments it is seen drawn out to the life. Paul, however, had something farther in view, for he contrasts the bare aspect of the <em>shadow </em>with the solidity of the <em>body</em>, and admonishes them, that it is the part of a madman to take hold of empty shadows, when it is in his power to handle the solid substance. Farther, while our sacraments represent Christ as absent as to view and distance of place, it is in such a manner as to testify that he has been once manifested, and they now also present him to us to be enjoyed. They are not, therefore, bare shadows, but on the contrary symbols <span class="cite-ref">(388)</span> of Christ’s presence, for they contain that <em>Yea and Amen </em>of all the <em>promises of God</em>, (<span class="bvs">2Co_1:20</span>,) which has been once manifested to us in Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(387)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Inutile et du tout vuide</span>;” — “Useless and altogether void.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(388)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Signes et tesmoignages</span>;” — “Signs and evidences.” </p></div></div>
