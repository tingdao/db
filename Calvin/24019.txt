<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And the door was shut. </em>At length it follows that <em>the door </em>of the heavenly kingdom <em>will be shut </em>against all who have not made provision, because they failed in the middle of the course. We must not enter here into minute inquiries, how it is that Christ says that <em>the foolish virgins </em>went to buy for it means nothing else than that all who shall not be ready at the very moment when they shall be called will be <em>shut out </em>from entering into heaven. </p></div>
