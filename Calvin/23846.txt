<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19</strong><em>Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth. </em>Let us learn from this what is the meaning of the word <em>curse, </em>namely, that the tree should be condemned to barrenness; as, on the other hand, God <em>blesses, </em>when by his voice he bestows fertility. It appears more clearly from Mark <em>, </em>that the fig-tree did not instantly wither, or, at least, that it was not observed by his disciples, until they saw it next day stripped of <em>leaves. </em>Mark <em>, </em>too, attributes to <em>Peter </em>what Matthew attributes equally to all the disciples; but as Christ replies in the plural number, it may naturally be inferred that one put the question in the name of all. </p></div>
