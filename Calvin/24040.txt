<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_25:31</span><strong>.</strong><em>Now when the Son of man shall come in his glory. </em>Christ follows out the same doctrine, and what he formerly described under parables, he now explains clearly and without figures. The sum of what is said is, that believers, in order to encourage themselves to a holy and upright conduct, ought to contemplate with the eyes of faith the heavenly life, which, though it is now concealed, will at length be manifested at the last coming of Christ. For, when he declares that, <em>when he shall come with the angels, then will he sit on the throne of his glory, </em>he contrasts this last revelation with the disorders and agitations of earthly warfare; as if he had said, that he did not appear for the purpose of immediately setting up his kingdom, and therefore that there was need of hope and patience, lest the disciples might be discouraged by long delay. Hence we infer that this was again added, in order that the disciples, being freed from mistake about immediate and sudden happiness, might keep their minds in warfare till Christ’s second coming, and might not give way, or be discouraged, on account of his absence. </p><p>This is the reason why he says that he will then assume the title of King; for though he commenced his reign on the earth, and now sits at the right hand of the Father, so as to exercise the supreme government of heaven and earth; yet he has not yet erected before the eyes of men that <em>throne, </em>from which his divine majesty will be far more fully displayed than it now is at the last day; for that<em>, </em>of which we now obtain by faith nothing more than a taste, will then have its full effect. So then Christ now sits on his heavenly throne, as fir as it is necessary that he shall reign for restraining his enemies and protecting the Church; but <em>then </em>he will appear openly, to establish perfect order in heaven and earth, to crush his enemies under his feet, to assemble his believing people to partake of an everlasting and blessed life, to ascend his judgment-seat; and, in a word, there will be a visible manifestation of the reason why the kingdom was given to him by the Father. He says that he <em>will come in his glory; </em>because, while he dwelt in this world as a mortal man, he appeared in the despised form of a servant. And he calls it his <em>glory, </em>though he elsewhere ascribes it to <em>his Father, </em>but the meaning is the same; for he means simply the divine glory, which at that time shone in the Father only, for in himself it was concealed. <span class="cite-ref">(172)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(172)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource qu’en Christ elle estoit cachee et ne se monstroit</span>;” — “because in Christ it was concealed, and was not exhibited.” </p></div></div>
