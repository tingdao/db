<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>For whom he has foreknown</em>, <em>etc. </em>He then shows, by the very order of election, that the afflictions of the faithful are nothing else than the manner by which they are conformed to the image of Christ; and that this was necessary, he had before declared. There is therefore no reason for us to be grieved, or to think it hard and grievous, that we are afflicted, unless we disapprove of the Lord’s election, by which we have been foreordained to life, and unless we are unwilling to bear the image of the Son of God, by which we are to be prepared for celestial glory. </p><p>But the foreknowledge of God, which Paul mentions, is not a bare prescience, as some unwise persons absurdly imagine, but the adoption by which he had always distinguished his children from the reprobate. <span class="cite-ref">(269)</span> In the same sense Peter says, that the faithful had been elected to the sanctification of the Spirit according to the foreknowledge of God. Hence those, to whom I have alluded, foolishly draw this inference, — That God has elected none but those whom he foresaw would be worthy of his grace. Peter does not in deed flatter the faithful, as though every one had been elected on account of his merit; but by reminding them of the eternal counsel of God, he wholly deprives them of all worthiness. So Paul does in this passage, who repeats by another word what he had said before of God’s purpose. It hence follows, that this knowledge is connected with God’s good pleasure; for he foreknew nothing out of himself, in adopting those whom he was pleased to adopt; but only marked out those whom he had purposed to elect. </p><p>The verb <span class="lang el-gr">προορίζειν</span>, which some translate, to <em>predestinate</em>, is to be understood according to what this passage requires; for Paul only meant, that God had so determined that all whom he has adopted should bear the image of Christ; nor has he simply said, that they were to be conformed to Christ, but to <em>the image of Christ</em>, that he might teach us that there is in Christ a living and conspicuous exemplar, which is exhibited to God’s children for imitation. The meaning then is, that gratuitous adoption, in which our salvation consists, is inseparable from the other decree, which determines that we are to bear the cross; for no one can be an heir of heaven without being conformed to the image of the only-begotten Son of God. </p><p><em>That he may be, </em>or,<em>that he might be, the first-born</em>, <em>etc.</em>; for the Greek infinitive, <span class="lang el-gr">εἶναι</span>, may be rendered in these two ways; but I prefer the first rendering. But in mentioning Christ’s primogeniture, Paul meant only to express this, — that since Christ possesses a pre-eminence among the children of God, he is rightly given to us as a pattern, so that we ought to refuse nothing which he has been pleased to undergo. Hence, that the celestial Father may in every way bear testimony to the authority and honor which he has conferred on his own Son, he will have all those whom he adopts to be the heirs of his kingdom, to be conformed to his example. Though indeed the condition of the godly is apparently various, as there is a difference between the members of the same body, there is yet a connection between every one and his own head. As then the first-born sustains the name of the family, so Christ is placed in a state of pre-eminence not only that he might excel in honor among the faithful, but also that he might include all under him himself under the common name of brotherhood. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(269)</span> Much controversy has been about the meaning of the verb<span class="lang el-gr">προέγνω, </span> in this place. Many of the Fathers, such as [<span class="bvs">Jerome </span>], [<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>], and [<span class="bvs">Theodoret </span>], regarded it in the sense of simple prescience, as having reference to those who would believe and obey the gospel. The verb is found only in this place, and in the following passages, <span class="bvs">Rom_11:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Act_26:5</span>; <span class="bvs">1Pe_1:20</span>; <span class="bvs">2Pe_3:17</span>. In the second, and in the last passage, it signifies merely a previous knowledge or acquaintance, and refers to men. In <span class="bvs">1Pe_1:20</span>, it is applied to Christ as having been “foreordained,” according to our version, “before the foundation of the world.” In this Epistle, <span class="bvs">Rom_11:2</span>, it refers to God, — “God hath not cast away his people whom he foreknew;” and according to the context, it means the same as elected; for the Apostle speaks of what God did “according to the election of grace,” and not according to foreseen faith. </p><p>The noun derived from it is found in two places, <span class="bvs">Act_2:23</span>, and <span class="bvs">1Pe_1:2</span>. In the first it evidently means decree, foreordination, and in the second, the same; where it is said, that those addressed by the Apostle were elected, “according to the foreknowledge of God<span class="lang el-gr">, κατὰ πρόγνωσιν Θεοῦ, </span> through the sanctification of the Spirit, <em>unto </em>obedience;” they were not then elected, according to God’s foreknowledge or foreordination, <em>because </em>of their obedience. This entirely subverts the gloss put on the verb in this passage. </p><p>The usual meaning given to the verb here is fore-approved, or chosen. [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>], [<span class="bvs">Turrettin </span>], and others, consider that<span class="lang el-gr">γινώσκω </span> has the same meaning with the verb <span class="lang he-il">ידע</span>, in Hebrew, which is sometimes that of approving or favoring, or regarding with love and approbation. So the compound verb may be rendered here, “whom he fore-approved, or foreknew,” as the objects of his choice: and this idea is what alone comports with the rest of the passage. </p><p>[<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] prefers another meaning, and that which it seems to have in <span class="bvs">1Pe_1:20</span>, “foreordained.” He says that<span class="lang el-gr">γινώσκω </span> means sometimes to will, to determine, to ordain, to decree, and brings examples from [<span class="bvs">Josephus </span>], [<span class="bvs">Plutarch </span>], and [<span class="bvs">Polybius </span>]. Then the compound verb would be here, “whom he foreordained,” or foredetermined. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
