As therefore Christ is the Church’s sole master, and as he alone without exception is worthy to be listened to, it is necessary to distinguish between him and others, as even Christ himself has testified respecting himself, (<span class="bvs">Mat_23:8</span>,) and no other is recommended to us by the Father with this honorable declaration, <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span> “Hear ye him.” (<span class="bvs">Mat_17:5</span>.) As, therefore, he alone is endowed with authority to rule us by his word, Paul says that others <em>are ours </em>— meaning, that they are appointed to us by God with the view of our making use of them — not that they should exercise dominion over our consciences. Thus on the one hand, he shows that they are not useless, and, on the other hand, he keeps them in their own place, that they may not exalt themselves in opposition to Christ. What he adds, as to <em>death</em>, <em>life</em>, and the rest, is hyperbolical, so far as concerns the passage before us. He had it in view, however, to reason, as it were, from the greater to the less, in this manner. “Christ having put in subjection to us <em>life </em>and <em>death</em>, and everything, can we doubt, whether he has not also made men subject to us, to help us by their ministrations — not to oppress us by tyranny.” </p><p>Now if any one takes occasion from this to allege, that the writings both of Paul and of Peter are subject to our scrutiny, inasmuch as they were men, and are not exempted from the common lot of others, I answer, that Paul, while he does not by any means spare himself or Peter, admonishes the Corinthians to distinguish between the person of the individual, and the dignity or distinction of office. “As for myself, viewed as a man, I wish to be judged of simply as a man, that Christ alone may have distinction in our ministry.” This, however, in a general way, we must hold, <span class="cite-ref">(203)</span> that all who discharge the office of the ministry, are <em>ours</em>, from the highest to the lowest, so that we are at liberty to withhold our assent to their doctrine, until they show that it is from Christ. For they must all be <em>tried</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Jo_4:1</span>,)and we must yield obedience to them, only when they have satisfactorily shown themselves to be faithful servants of Christ. Now as to Peter and Paul, this point being beyond all controversy, and the Lord having furnished us with amply sufficient evidence, that their doctrine has come forth from Him, when we receive as an oracle from heaven, and venerate everything that they have delivered to us, we hear not so much <em>them</em>, as Christ speaking in them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(201)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, quelle estime on en doit auoir</span>;” — “That is to easy, in what esteem they ought to be held.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(202)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nul autre ne nous a este donne du Pere authorize de ce titre et commandement</span>;” — “No other has been given to us by the Father, authorized by this distinction and injunction.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(203)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour vne maxime</span>;” — “As a maxim.” </p></div></div>
