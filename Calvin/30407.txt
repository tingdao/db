<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>Which stumble at the word </em>He points out here the manner in which Christ becomes a stumbling, even when men perversely oppose the word of God. This the Jews did; for though they professed themselves willing to receive the Messiah, yet they furiously rejected him when presented to them by God. The Papists do the same in the present day; they worship only the name of Christ, while they cannot endure the doctrine of the Gospel. Here Peter intimates that all who receive not Christ as revealed in the Gospel, are adversaries to God, and resist his word, and also that Christ is to none for destruction, but to those who, through headstrong wickedness and obstinacy, rush against the word of God. </p><p>And this is especially what deserves to be noticed, lest our fault should be imputed to Christ; for, as he has been given to us as a foundation, it is as it were an accidental thing that he becomes a rock of offense. In short, his proper office is to prepare us for a spiritual temple to God; but it is the fault of men that they stumble at him, even because unbelief leads men to contend with God. Hence Peter, in order to set forth the character of the conflict, said that they were the unbelieving. </p><p><em>Whereunto also they were appointed, </em>or, <em>to which they had been ordained</em>. This passage may be explained in two ways. It is, indeed, certain that Peter spoke of the Jews; and the common interpretation is, that they were appointed to believe, for the promise of salvation was destined for them. But the other sense is equally suitable, that they had been appointed to unbelief; as Pharaoh is said to have been set up for this end, that he might resist God, and all the reprobate are destined for the same purpose. And what inclines me to this meaning is the particle <span class="lang el-gr">καὶ</span> (also) which is put in. <span class="cite-ref">(24)</span> If, however, the first view be preferred, then it is a vehement upbraiding; for Peter does hence enhance the sin of unbelief in the people who had been chosen by God, because they rejected the salvation that had been peculiarly ordained for them. And no doubt this circumstance rendered them doubly inexcusable, that having been called in preference to others, they had refused to hear God. But, by saying that they were appointed to believe, he refers only to their outward call, even according to the covenant which God had made generally with the whole nation. At the same time their ingratitude, as it has been said, was sufficiently proved, when they rejected the word preached to them. </p><p><strong>(24)</strong> The most obvious meaning is, to consider the phrase, “who stumble at the word,” as the antecedent to <span class="lang el-gr">εἰς ὃ</span> “to which:” they being disobedient or unbelieving were destined to stumble at the word, and thereby to fall and to be broken. (<span class="bvs">Isa_8:14</span>.) To the believing it was precious, but to the unbelieving it became the stone of stumbling; and this stumbling is a judgment to which all the unpersuaded (literally) or the unbelieving, are destined. I would render the two verses thus, — </p><p>“To you then who believe it is precious; but to the unbelieving (<em>with regard to </em>the stone which the builders have rejected, the same <em>which </em>has become the head of the corner) even a stone of stumbling and rock of offense; that is, <em>to those </em>who stumble at the word, being unbelieving; to which also they have been appointed:” that is, according to the testimony of Scripture. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
