<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Now we know that God heareth not sinners. </em>Those who think that the man spoke this, in accordance with the opinion of the people, are mistaken; for the word <em>sinner</em>, in this passage, as in another which lately occurred, means an ungodly and immoral person. It is the uniform doctrine of Scripture, that God does not listen to any but those who call upon him with truth and sincerity. For while faith alone opens the door to us to go to God, it is certain that all wicked men are excluded from approaching to him; and he even declares that <em>he detests their prayers</em>, (<span class="bvs">Pro_28:9</span>,) as <em>he abhors their sacrifices</em>, (<span class="bvs">Pro_15:8</span>.) It is by a special privilege that he invites his children to himself; and it is <em>the Spirit of adoption </em>alone <em>that crieth out in our hearts</em>, <em>Abba</em>, <em>Father</em>, (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Gal_4:6</span>.) In short, no man is properly disposed to pray to God, unless his heart be purified by faith. But wicked men profane the sacred name of God by their prayers, and therefore they deserve rather to be punished for this sacrilege, than to obtain any thing for salvation. Accordingly, the blind man does not reason inconclusively, that Christ has come from God, because God lends a favorable ear to his prayers. </p></div>
