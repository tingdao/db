Therefore he answereth this objection also, because he was enforced with the stubbornness of his enemies to fly to this fortress [asylum]. For he is excused by necessity, because he had no other way to escape death. And after that he had excused that which was done already, he promiseth that he will so handle his matter hereafter,<span class="cite-ref">(678)</span> that he will not labor against the Jews.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(678)</span></p><p>“ Ita causam suam acturum,” will so plead his cause. </p></div></div>
