<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Thy faith hath saved thee. </em>The word <em>save </em>is restricted by some commentators to the cleanness of the flesh. <span class="cite-ref">(339)</span> But if this be the case, since Christ commends the lively faith of this Samaritan, it may be asked, how were the other nine <em>saved? </em>for all of them without exception obtained the same cure. <span class="cite-ref">(340)</span> We must therefore arrive at the conclusion, that Christ has here pronounced a different estimate of the gift of God from that which is usually pronounced by ungodly men; namely, that it was a token or pledge of God’s fatherly love. The <em>nine lepers were cured; </em>but as they wickedly efface the remembrance of the grace of God, the cure itself is debased and contaminated by their ingratitude, so that they do not derive from it the advantage which they ought. It is faith alone that sanctifies the gifts of God to us, so that they become pure, and, united to the lawful use of them, contribute to our salvation. Lastly, by this word Christ has informed us in what manner we lawfully enjoy divine favors. Hence we infer, that he included the eternal salvation of the soul along with the temporal gift. The <em>Samaritan </em>was <em>saved </em>by his <em>faith </em>How? Certainly not because he was cured of leprosy, (for this was likewise obtained by the rest,) but because he was admitted into the number of the children of God, and received from His hand a pledge of fatherly kindness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(339)</span> “ Le mot dont a ici use l’Evangeliste est celuy mesme que quasi par tout on tourne, <em>Sauver</em>. ” — “The word which the Evangelist has here employed ( <span class="lang el-gr">σέσωκε</span>) is the same word which is almost always rendered <em>save. </em>” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(340)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Une mesme guairison corporelle</span>;” — “the same bodily cure.” </p></div></div>
