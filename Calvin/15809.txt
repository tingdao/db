<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>A good man </em>This is the commonly received interpretation of the passage. I am disposed, however, to prefer another, That it shall be well with those who are gracious and communicative; because this is more in accordance with the purport of the prophet’s language. It is his intention to show how greatly the ungodly are deceived, when they aspire after happiness by nefarious and unlawful practices; seeing that the favor of God is the source and cause of all good things. Hence it becomes necessary to supply the relative <em>who. </em>He proceeds, therefore, to put us on our guard as to the deception which those practice upon themselves, who hasten to enrich themselves by sordid parsimony and oppressive extortion; inasmuch as the faithful, by their clemency and kindness, open up a channel, through which the favor of God flows to them: for the term <span class="lang he-il">טוב</span>, <em>tob, </em>though in the masculine gender, signifying <em>good, </em>is often taken as if it were neuter, to denote that which is good. He puts <em>lending </em>as if it were the fruit of mercy; for the usurer also lends, but it is that, under the false pretense of assisting the distressed, he may plunder them. It is, then, the truly liberal, who, from compassion, and not with the design of ensnaring the poor, grant relief to them, that God makes prosperous. The term <span class="lang he-il">דבים</span><em>, debarim, </em>in the end of the verse, signifies <em>words; </em>but, along with David Kimchi, the most correct expositor among the Rabbins, I take it to mean <em>affairs. Words </em>is a very tame translation, <span class="cite-ref">(347)</span> not to say, that, if this had been the prophet’s intention, he would have expressed himself in more simple terms. The translation which I have given is the proper one, that the righteous will manage their affairs with prudence and discernment; so that, in their domestic affairs, they will neither be too lavish nor sordidly parsimonious; but, in every thing, they will study to combine frugality with economy, without giving way to luxury. And, in all their mercantile transactions; they will always be guided by the principles of equity and morality. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(347)</span> It is so translated in some of the ancient versions, and by several critics. In the Syriac it is, “will support his words in judgment;” <em>i.e</em>. , will never utter any thing but what is strictly true. In like manner, Cocceius. In the Arabic, which is followed by Castalio, it is, “will moderate his words in judgment;”<em>i.e</em>. , will speak as favourably of delinquents as he can consistently with truth, contrary to the practice of the wicked. — <span class="bvs">Psa_94:21</span>. </p></div></div>
