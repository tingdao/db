<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_23:16</span><strong>.</strong><em>I will therefore chastise him, and release him. </em>If any slight offense had been committed, which was not a capital crime, the Roman governors <span class="cite-ref">(262)</span> were wont to cause the offenders to be beaten with rods; and this kind of punishment was called, in the Latin language, <em>coerctio </em> Pilate, therefore, acts unjustly when, after pronouncing Christ to be free from all blame, he resolves to punish him, as if he had been guilty of an ordinary offense; for he not only declares that he has found in him no crime worthy of death, but asserts his innocence in the most unqualified manner. Why, then, does he beat him with rods? But earthly men, who are not confirmed by the Spirit of God in a constant wish to do what is right, even though they are desirous to maintain integrity, are accustomed, in this manner, to yield so far as to commit small injuries, when they are compelled. And not only do they reckon it a valid excuse, that they have not perpetrated a very heinous crime, but they even claim for themselves the praise of mildness, because they have, to some extent, spared the innocent. As to the Son of God, had he been dismissed in this manner, he would have carried with him the shame of having been scourged, without any advantage to our salvation; but on the cross, as in a magnificent chariot, he triumphed over his enemies and ours. </p><p>Would to God <span class="cite-ref">(263)</span> that the world were not now filled with many Pilates! But we see that what was begun in the head is accomplished in the members. The Popish clergy persecute his holy servants with the same cruelty with which the Jewish priests cried out, demanding that Christ should be put to death. Many of the judges, indeed, willingly offer themselves as executioners to follow out their rage; <span class="cite-ref">(264)</span> but when they shrink from shedding blood, so as to save innocent men from dying, they scourge Christ himself, who is the only righteousness of God. For when they compel the worshippers of God to deny the Gospel, for the purpose of saving their life, what else is it than to cause the name of Christ to undergo the disgrace of being beaten with rods? Yet in their defense they plead the violence of his enemies; as if this pretense were a sufficient cloak for their treacherous cowardice, which, if it was not excusable in Pilate, deserves to be viewed in them with the highest detestation. But though our three Evangelists pass by this circumstance, yet it is evident from the Evangelist John, (<span class="bvs">Joh_14:1</span>,) that Christ was beaten with rods, while Pilate was still laboring to save his life, in order that so appalling a spectacle might appease the rage of the people. But John has also added, that it could not be appeased until the Author of life was put to death. </p><p><strong>(262)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les Gouverneurs deputez de par l’Empereur de Rome</span>;” — “the Governors appointed by the Emperor of Rome.” </p><p><strong>(263)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pleust à Dieu</span>.” </p><p><strong>(264)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Entre les juges, la plus grand’ part ne demandent pas mieux que de servir de bourreaux pour executer la rage des supposts de l’Antechrist</span>.” — “Among the judges, the greater part ask nothing better than to act as hangmen to execute the rage of the supporters of Antichrist.” </p></div>
