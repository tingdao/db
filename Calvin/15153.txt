<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>And he remembered that they were flesh. </em>Another reason is now brought forward why God had compassion on the people, which is, his unwillingness to try his strength against men who are so constituted as to live only for a short period in this world, and who then quickly pass away; for the forms of expression here used denote the frailty by which the condition of men is made miserable. <em>Flesh </em>and <em>spirit </em>are frequently contrasted in the Scriptures; not only when<em>flesh </em>means our depraved and sinful nature, and <em>spirit </em>the uprightness to which the children of God are born again; but also when men are called <em>flesh, </em>because there is nothing firm or stable in them: as it is said in Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_31:3</span>,) “Egypt is flesh, and not spirit.” In this passage, however, the<em>words flesh </em>and <em>spirit </em>are employed in the same sense — <em>flesh </em>meaning that men are subject to corruption and putrefaction; and <em>spirit, </em>that they are only a breath or a fleeting shadow. As men are brought to death by a continual wasting and decay, the people are compared to a wind which passes away, and which, of its own accord, falls and does not return again. When we have run our race, we do not commence a new life upon the earth; even as it is said in Job, </p><p>“For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?” (<span class="bvs">Job_14:7</span>) </p><p>The meaning, then, as we may now clearly perceive, is, that God, in the exercise of his mercy and goodness, bare with the Jews, not because they deserved this, but because their frail and transitory condition called forth his pity and induced him to pardon them. We shall afterwards meet with an almost similar statement in <span class="bvs">Psa_103:13</span>, where God is represented as being merciful to us, because he sees that we are like grass, and that we soon wither and become dry like hay. Now, if God find in us nothing but misery to move him to compassion, it follows that it is solely his own pure and undeserved goodness which induces him to sustain us. When it is affirmed that men <em>return not, </em>when they have finished the course of their life in this world, it is not meant to exclude the hope of a future resurrection; for men are contemplated only as they are in themselves, and it is merely their state on earth which is spoken of. With respect to the renovation of man to the heavenly life, it is a miracle far surpassing nature. In the same sense it is said, in another place, “His spirit goeth forth, and returneth not,” (<span class="bvs">Wis_16:14</span>;) language which implies that men, when they are born into the world, do not bring with them the hope of future restoration, which must be derived from the grace of regeneration. </p></div>
