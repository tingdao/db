<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>For to you Gentiles I speak, etc. </em>He confirms by a strong reason, that nothing shall be lost by the Gentiles, were the Jews to return again to favor with God; for he shows, that the salvation of both is so connected, that it can by the same means be promoted. For he thus addresses the Gentiles, — “Though I am peculiarly destined to be your Apostle, and ought therefore with special care to seek your salvation, with which I am charged, and to omit as it were all other things, and to labor for that only, I shall yet be faithfully discharging my office, by gaining to Christ any of my own nation; and this will be for the glory of my ministry, and so for your good.” <span class="cite-ref">(352)</span> For whatever served to render Paul’s ministry illustrious, was advantageous to the Gentiles, whose salvation was its object. </p><p>And here also he uses the verb <span class="lang el-gr">παραζηλῶσαι</span>, <em>to provoke to emulation</em>, and for this purpose, that the Gentiles might seek the accomplishment of Moses’ prophecy, such as he describes, when they understood that it would be for their benefit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(352)</span> The meaning attached here to the words<span class="lang el-gr">τὴν διακονίαν μου δοξάζω, </span> is somewhat different from what is commonly understood. Its classical sense, “highly to estimate,” is what is generally given here to the verb: but [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] takes it in a sense in which it is mostly taken in Scripture, as meaning, “to render illustrious,” or eminent, “to render glorious.” The construction of the two <span class="bvs">Rom_11:13</span> and 14, is somewhat difficult, and the meaning is not very clear. To include the words, “as I am indeed the Apostle of the Gentiles,” in a parenthesis, as it is done by some, would render the sense more evident, and to add “this” after “say,” and “that” before “I render.” The version then would be as follows, — </p><p><span class="cite-note">13.</span>For I say <em>this </em>to you Gentiles (as I am indeed the Apostle of the Gentiles,) <em>that </em>I render my ministry glorious, </p><p><span class="cite-note">14.</span>If I shall by any means excite to emulation my own flesh and save some of them. </p><p>The sentiment in the last clause is the same as that at the end of <span class="bvs">Rom_11:11</span>. The<em>Vulgate</em>, and some of the Latin Fathers, and also [<span class="bvs">Luther </span>], read<span class="lang el-gr">δοξάσω </span> in the future tense; which would make the passage read better, — “<em>that </em>I shall render,” etc. These two verses are not necessarily connected with the Apostle’s argument; for in the following verse he resumes the subject of <span class="bvs">Rom_11:12</span>, or rather, as his usual manner is, he states the same thing in other words and in more explicit and stronger terms. So that the<span class="lang el-gr">γὰρ </span> in the next verse may very properly be rendered “yea,” or as an illative, “then.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
