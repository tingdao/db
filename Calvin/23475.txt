<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. </em>We know that it is customary with Christ to introduce this sentence, whenever he treats of subjects which are highly important, and which deserve no ordinary attention. <span class="cite-ref">(18)</span> He reminds us, at the same time, of the reason why the mysteries of which he speaks are not received by all. It is because many of his hearers are deaf, or at least have their ears closed. But now, as every man is hindered not only by his own unbelief, but by the mutual influence which men exercise on each other, Christ here exhorts the elect of God, whose ears have been pierced, to consider attentively this remarkable secret of God, and not to remain deaf with unbelievers. </p><p><strong>(18)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et qui ne doit pas estre escoutee par acquit</span>;” — “and which ought not to be listened to in an indifferent manner.” </p></div>
