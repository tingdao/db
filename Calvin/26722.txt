<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>He who hateth me hateth my Father also. </em>This is a remarkable passage, which teaches us that no man can hate the doctrine of the Gospel without manifesting his impiety against God. There are many, indeed, who profess differently in words; for, though they abhor the Gospel, still they wish to be thought very good servants of God; but it is false, for a contempt of God is concealed within. In this manner Christ discovers the hypocrisy of many by the light of his doctrine; and on this subject we have spoken more largely under that passage, </p><p>Whosoever doeth what is evil hateth the light <span class="cite-ref">(89)</span> (<span class="bvs">Joh_3:20</span>,) </p><p>and under that passage, </p><p>He who honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father, <span class="cite-ref">(90)</span><LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_5:23</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(89)</span> See vol. 1, p. 128. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(90)</span> See vol. 1, p. 199. </p></div></div>
