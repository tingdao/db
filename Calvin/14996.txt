<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>And thy righteousness, O God! is very high. </em><span class="cite-ref">(115)</span> Some connect this verse with the preceding, and repeating the verb <em>I will declare, </em>as common to both verses, translate, And <em>I will declare thy righteousness, O God! </em>But this being a matter of small importance, I will not dwell upon it. David prosecutes at greater length the subject of which he had previously spoken. In the first place, he <em>declares </em>that <em>the righteousness of God is very high; </em>secondly, that it wrought mightily; and, finally, he exclaims in admiration, <em>Who is like thee? </em>It is worthy of notice, that the righteousness of God, the effects of which are near to us and conspicuous, is yet placed on high, inasmuch as it cannot be comprehended by our finite understanding. Whilst we measure it according to our own limited standard, we are overwhelmed and swallowed up by the smallest temptation. In order, therefore, to give it free course to save us, it behoves us to take a large and a comprehensive view — to look above and beneath, far and wide, that we may form some due conceptions of its amplitude. The same remarks apply to the second clause, which makes mention of the works of God: <em>For thou hast done great things. </em>If we attribute to his known power the praise which is due to it, we will never want ground for entertaining good hope. Finally, our sense of the goodness of God should extend so far as to ravish us with admiration; for thus it will come to pass that our minds, which are often distracted by an unholy disquietude, will repose upon God alone. If any temptation thrusts itself upon us, we immediately magnify a fly into an elephant; or rather, we rear very high mountains, which keep the hand of God from reaching us; and at the same time we basely limit the power of God. The exclamation of David, then, <em>Who is like thee? </em>tends to teach us the lesson, that we should force our way through every impediment by faith, and regard the power of God, which is well entitled to be so regarded, as superior to all obstacles. All men, indeed, confess with the mouth, that none is like God; but there is scarce one out of a hundred who is truly and fully persuaded that He alone is sufficient to save us. </p><p><strong>(115)</strong> “Usque in excelsum.” — <em>Lat </em>“<span class="lang fr-fr">Est eslevee jusques en haut</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “<span class="lang he-il">אד מרום</span>,<em>ad marom </em>— is up to the exalted place, — reaches <em>up to heaven </em>The mercy of God fills all <em>space </em>and <em>place </em>It crowns in the heavens what it governed upon earth.” — <em>Dr Adam Clarke </em></p></div>
