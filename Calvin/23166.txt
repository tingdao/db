<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And thou shalt call his name JESUS</em>. I have already explained briefly, but as far as was necessary, the meaning of that word. At present I shall only add, that the words of the angel set aside the dream of those who derive it from the essential name of God, Jehovah; for the angel expresses the reason why the Son of God is so called, <em>Because he shall SAVE his people; </em>which suggests quite a different etymology from what they have contrived. It is justly and appropriately added, they tell us, that Christ will be the author of salvation, because he is the Eternal God. But in vain do they attempt to escape by this subterfuge; for the nature of the blessing which God bestows upon us is not all that is here stated. This office was conferred upon his Son from the fact, from the command which had been given to him by the Father, from the office with which he was invested when he came down to us from heaven. Besides, the two words <span class="lang el-gr">᾿Ιησοῦς</span> and <span class="lang he-il">יהוה</span><em>, Jesus </em>and <em>Jehovah, </em>agree but in two letters, and differ in all the rest; which makes it exceedingly absurd to allege any affinity whatever between them, as if they were but one name. Such mixtures I leave to the alchymists, or to those who closely resemble them, the Cabalists who contrive for us those trifling and affected refinements. </p><p>When the Son of God came to us clothed in flesh, he received from the Father a name which plainly told for what purpose he came, what was his power, and what we had a right to expect from him. for the name <em>Jesus </em>is derived from the Hebrew verb, in the Hiphil conjugation, <span class="lang he-il">הושיע</span>, which signifies <em>to save </em>In Hebrew it is pronounced differently, <em>Jehoshua; </em>but the Evangelists, who wrote in Greek, followed the customary mode of pronunciation; for in the writings of Moses, and in the other books of the Old Testament, the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">יהושוע</span>, <em>Jehoshua, </em>or <em>Joshua, </em>is rendered by the Greek translators <span class="lang el-gr">᾿Ιησοῦς</span>, <em>Jesus </em>But I must mention another instance of the ignorance of those who derive — or, I would rather say, who forcibly tear — the name <em>Jesus </em>from <em>Jehovah </em>They hold it to be in the highest degree improper that any mortal man should share this name in common with the Son of God, and make a strange outcry that Christ would never allow his name to be so profaned. As if the reply were not at hand, that the name <em>Jesus </em>was quite as commonly used in those days as the name <em>Joshua </em>Now, as it is sufficiently clear that the name <em>Jesus </em>presents to us the Son of God as the Author of salvation, let us examine more closely the words of the angel. </p><p><em>He shall save his people from their sins </em>The first truth taught us by these words is, that those whom Christ is sent to save are in themselves lost. But he is expressly called the Savior of the Church. If those whom God admits to fellowship with himself were sunk in death and ruin till they were restored to life by Christ, what shall we say of “strangers” (<span class="bvs">Eph_2:12</span>) who have never been illuminated by the hope of life? When salvation is declared to be shut up in Christ, it clearly implies that the whole human race is devoted to destruction. The cause of this destruction ought also to be observed; for it is not unjustly, or without good reason, that the Heavenly Judge pronounces us to be accursed. The angel declares that we have perished, and are overwhelmed by an awful condemnation, because we stand excluded from life by our sins. Thus we obtain a view of our corruption and depravity; for if any man lived a perfectly holy life, he might do without Christ as a Redeemer. But all to a man need his grace; and, therefore, it follows that they are the slaves of sin, and are destitute of true righteousness. </p><p>Hence, too, we learn in what way or manner Christ saves; he delivers us from sins This deliverance consists of two parts. Having made a complete atonement, he brings us a free pardon, which delivers us from condemnation to death, and reconciles us to God. Again, by the sanctifying influences of his Spirit, he frees us from the tyranny of Satan, that we may live “unto righteousness,” (<span class="bvs">1Pe_2:24</span>.) Christ is not truly acknowledged as a Savior, till, on the one hand, we learn to receive a free pardon of our sins, and know that we are accounted righteous before God, because we are free from guilt; and till, on the other hand, we ask from him the Spirit of righteousness and holiness, having no confidence whatever in our own works or power. By Christ’s <em>people </em>the angel unquestionably means the Jews, to whom he was appointed as Head and King; but as the Gentiles were shortly afterwards to be ingrafted into the stock of Abraham, (<span class="bvs">Rom_11:17</span>,) this promise of <em>salvation </em>is extended indiscriminately to all who are incorporated by faith in the “one body” (<span class="bvs">1Co_12:20</span>) of the Church. </p></div>
