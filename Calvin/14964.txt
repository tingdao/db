<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Let them be blotted out from the book of the living. </em><span class="cite-ref">(95)</span> This is the last imprecation, and it is the most dreadful of the whole; but it nevertheless uniformly follows the persevered in impenitence and incorrigible obduracy of which the Psalmist has spoken above. After having taken away from them all hope of repentance, he denounces against them eternal destruction, which is the obvious meaning of the prayer, that they might be blotted out of the book of the living; for all those must inevitably perish who are not found written or enrolled in the book of life. This is indeed an improper manner of speaking; but it is one well adapted to our limited capacity, the book of life being nothing else than the eternal purpose of God, by which he has predestinated his own people to salvation. God, it is certain, is absolutely immutable; and, further, we know that those who are adopted to the hope of salvation were written before the foundation of the world, (<span class="bvs">Eph_1:4</span>;) but as God’s eternal purpose of election is incomprehensible, it is said, in accommodation to the imperfection of the human understanding, that those whom God openly, and by manifest signs, enrols among his people, <em>are written. </em>On the other hand, those whom God openly rejects and casts out of his Church are, for the same reason, said <em>to be blotted out. </em>As then David desires that the vengeance of God may be manifested, he very properly speaks of the reprobation of his enemies in language accommodated to our understanding; as if he had said, O God! reckon them not among the number or ranks of thy people, and let them not be gathered together with thy Church; but rather show by destroying them that thou hast rejected them; and although they occupy a place for a time among thy faithful ones, do thou at length cut them off, to make it manifest that they were aliens, though they were mingled with the members of thy family. Ezekiel uses language of similar import when he says, </p><p>“And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Eze_13:9</span>) </p><p>That, however, continues true which is spoken by the Apostle John, (<span class="bvs">1Jo_2:19</span>,) that none who have been once really the children of God will ever finally fall away or be wholly cut off. <span class="cite-ref">(96)</span> But as hypocrites presumptuously boast that they are the chief members of the Church, the Holy Spirit well expresses their rejection, by the figure of their being blotted out of the book of life. Moreover, it is to be observed that, in the second clause, all the elect of God are called <em>the righteous; </em>for, as Paul says in <span class="bvs">1Th_4:3</span>, </p><p>“This is the will of God, even our sanctification, that every one of us should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor: for God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.” (<span class="bvs">1Th_4:3</span>) </p><p>And the climax which the same Apostle uses in the 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span> chapter of his Epistle to the Romans, at the 30<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, is well known: </p><p>“Whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom <LineBreak />he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, <LineBreak />them he also glorified.” (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:30</span>) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(95)</span> “This phrase,” observes Bishop Mant, “which is not unusual in Scripture, alludes to the custom of well ordered cities, which kept registers, containing all the names of the citizens. Out of these registers the names of apostates, fugitives, and criminals, were erased, as also those of the deceased: whence the expression ‘blotting,’ or ‘erasing names from the book of life.’” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(96)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et se retrancher du tout</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
