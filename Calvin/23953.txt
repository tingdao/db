<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Therefore, lo, I send to you. Luke </em>introduces it in a still more emphatic manner, <em>Wherefore also the Wisdom of God hath said; </em>which some commentators explain thus: “I, who am the eternal <em>Wisdom of God, </em>declare this concerning you.” But I am more inclined to believe that, according to the ordinary custom of Scripture, God is here represented as speaking in the person of his <em>Wisdom; </em>so that the meaning is, <em>“God </em>foretold long ago, by the prophetic Spirit, what would happen with regard to you.” This sentence, I acknowledge, is nowhere to be found literally: but as God denounces the incorrigible obstinacy of that people in many places of Scripture, Christ draws up a kind of summary of them, and by this personification <span class="cite-ref">(111)</span> expresses more clearly what was the judgment of God as to the incurable wickedness of that nation. For if those teachers would have no success, it might have appeared strange that Christ should have desired them to weary themselves to no purpose. Men argue thus: “God labors in vain, when he sends his word to the reprobate, who, he knows, will continue obstinate.” And hypocrites, as if it were sufficient of itself to have preachers of the heavenly doctrine continually with them, though they show themselves to be disobedient, entertain the conviction that God is reconciled and favorable to them, provided that the outward word be heard amongst them. </p><p>Thus the Jews fiercely boasted that, in comparison of other nations, they had always enjoyed the best <em>prophets </em>and teachers, and, as if they had deserved so great an honor, they considered this to be an undoubted proof of their own excellence. <span class="cite-ref">(112)</span> To put down this foolish boasting, Christ not only affirms that they do not excel other nations on the ground of having received from God distinguished prophets and expounders of <em>his Wisdom, </em>but maintains that this ilk requited favor is a greater reproach, and will bring upon them a heavier condemnation, because the purpose of God was different from what they supposed, namely, to render them more inexcusable, and to bring their wicked malice to the highest pitch; as if he had said, “Though prophets have been appointed to you by heaven in close succession, it is idly and foolishly that you claim this as an honor; for God had quite a different object in his secret judgment, which was, to lay open, by an uninterrupted succession of gracious invitations, your wicked obstinacy, and, on your being convicted of it, to involve the children in the same condemnation with the fathers.” </p><p>With regard to the words, the discourse as related by Matthew is defective, but its meaning must be supplied from the words of Luke. The mention of <em>scribes and wise men </em>along with <em>prophets </em>tends to magnify the grace of God; by which their ingratitude becomes more apparent, since, though God left nothing undone for their instruction, they made no proficiency. Instead of <em>wise men </em>and <em>scribes, Luke </em>mentions <em>apostles, </em>but the meaning is the same. This passage shows that God does not always bestow salvation on men when he sends his word to them, but that he sometimes intends to have it proclaimed to the reprobate, who, he knows, will continue obstinate, that it may be to them </p><p>the savior of death unto death, (<span class="bvs">2Co_2:16</span>.) </p><p>The word of God, indeed, in itself and by its own nature, brings salvation, and invites all men indiscriminately to the hope of eternal life; but as all are not inwardly drawn, and as God does not pierce the ears of ally—in short, as they are not renewed to repentance or bent to obedience, those who reject the word of God render it, by their unbelief, deadly and destructive. </p><p>While God foresees that this will be the result, he purposely sends his prophets to them, that he may involve the reprobate in severer condemnation, as is more fully explained by Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_6:10</span>.) This, I acknowledge, is very far from being agreeable to the reason of the flesh, as we see that unholy despisers of God seize on it as a plausible excuse for barking, that God, like some cruel tyrant, takes pleasure in inflicting more severe punishment on men whom, without any expectation of advantage, he knowingly and willingly hardens more and more. But by such examples God exercises the modesty of believers. Let us maintain such sobriety as to tremble and adore what exceeds our senses. Those who say, that God’s foreknowledge does not hinder unbelievers from being saved, foolishly make use of an idle defense for excusing God. I admit that the reprobate, in bringing death upon themselves, have no intention of doing what God foresaw would happen, and therefore that the fault of their perishing cannot be ascribed to His foreknowledge; but I assert that it is improper to employ this sophistry in defending the justice of God, because it may be immediately objected that it lies with God to make them repent, for the gift of faith and repentance is in his power. </p><p>We shall next be met by this objection, What is the reason why <em>God, </em>by a fixed and deliberate purpose, appoints the light of his word to blind men? When they have been devoted to eternal death, why is he not satisfied with their simple ruin? and why does he wish that they should perish twice or three times? There is nothing left for us but to ascribe glory to the <em>judgments of God, </em>by exclaiming with Paul, that they are a deep and unfathomable abyss, (<span class="bvs">Rom_11:33</span>.) But it is asked, How does he declare that the prophecies will turn to the destruction of the Jews, while his adoption still continued to be in force towards that nation? I reply, As but a small portion embraced the word by faith for salvation, this passage relates to the greater number or the whole body; as Isaiah, after having predicted the general destruction of the nation, is commanded </p><p>to seal the law of God among the disciples, (<span class="bvs">Isa_8:16</span>.) </p><p>Let us know then that, wherever the Scripture denounces eternal death against the Jews, it excepts a <em>remnant, </em>(<span class="bvs">Isa_1:9</span>; <span class="bvs">Rom_11:5</span>;) that is, those in whom the Lord <em>preserves some seed </em>on account of his free <em>election </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(111)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En introduisant la Sapience de Dieu parlant</span>;” — “by introducing the Wisdom of God as speaking.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(112)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme un certain tesmoignage qu’ils estoyent gens de bien</span>;” — “as an undoubted proof that they were good people.” </p></div></div>
