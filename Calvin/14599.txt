<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>My heart is boiling over </em><span class="cite-ref">(157)</span><em>with a good matter </em>This preface shows sufficiently that the subject of the psalm is no common one; for whoever the author of it may have been, he here intimates, at the very outset, that he will treat of great and glorious things. The Holy Spirit is not accustomed to inspire the servants of God to utter great swelling words, and to pour forth empty sounds into the air; and, therefore, we may naturally conclude, that the subject here treated of is not merely a transitory and earthly kingdom, but sortie-thing more excellent. Were not this the case, what end would it serve to announce, as the prophet does in such a magnificent style, that his heart <em>was boiling over, </em>from his ardent desire to be employed in rehearsing the praises of the king? Some prefer to translate the word <em>to utter; </em>but the other signification of the word appears to me to be more appropriate; and it is confirmed by this, that from this verb is derived the noun <span class="lang he-il">מרהשת</span>, <em>marchesheth, </em>a word which is found once or twice in Moses, and signifies a frying-pan, in which sweatmeats are baked. It is then of the same import as if the inspired writer had said, My heart is ready to breathe forth something excellent and worthy of being remembered. He afterwards expresses the harmony between the tongue and the heart, when he compares his tongue to <em>the pen of a swift </em>and ready <em>writer </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(157)</span> “<span class="lang he-il">רחש</span>, <em>rachash</em>, <em>boileth</em>, or <em>bubbleth up</em>, denotes the language of the heart, full and ready for utterance.” —<em>Bythner </em>’<em>s Lyra </em>The Psalmist’s heart was so full and warmed with the subject of the psalm, that it could not contain; and the opening of the poem evinces that it was so, for he abruptly breaks forth into an annunciation of its subject as if impatient of restraint. Ainsworth thinks there is here an allusion to the boiling of the <em>minchah</em>, or meat-offering under the law in the frying-pan, (<span class="bvs">Lev_7:9</span>.) It was there boiled in oil, being made of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil, (<span class="bvs">Lev_11:5</span>;) and afterwards was presented to the Lord by the priest, verse 8, etc. “Here,” says he, “the matter of this psalm is the <em>minchah </em>or oblation, which with the oil, the grace of the spirit, was boiled and prepared in the prophet’s breast, and now presented.” </p></div></div>
