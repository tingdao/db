<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And if their fall, etc. </em>As he had taught us that after the Jews were repudiated, the Gentiles were introduced in their place, that he might not make the salvation of the Jews to be disliked by the Gentiles, as though their salvation depended on the ruin of the Jews, he anticipates this false notion, and lays down a sentiment of an opposite kind, that nothing would conduce more to advance the salvation of the Gentiles, than that the grace of God should flourish and abound among the Jews. To prove this, he derives an argument from the less, — “If their fall had raised the Gentiles, and their diminution had enriched them, how much more their fullness?” for the first was done contrary to nature, and the last will be done according to a natural order of things. And it is no objection to this reasoning, that the word of God had flowed to the Gentiles, after the Jews had rejected, and, as it were, cast it from them; for if they had received it, their faith would have brought forth much more fruit than their unbelief had occasioned; for the truth of God would have been thereby confirmed by being accomplished in them, and they also themselves would have led many by their teaching, whom they, on the contrary, by their perverseness, had turned aside. </p><p>Now he would have spoken more strictly correct, if, to the <em>fall, </em>he had opposed <em>rising: </em><span class="cite-ref">(351)</span> of this I remind you, that no one may expect here an adorned language, and may not be offended with this simple mode of speaking; for these things were written to mold the heart and not the tongue. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(351)</span> This is not quite correct: the first part is a mere announcement of a fact — the fall of the Jews; and then in what follows, according to the usual style of Scripture, the same thing is stated in other words, and a corresponding clause is added; and the antithesis is found to be suitable — the diminution and the completion. The reason for the restatement of the first clause seems to be this, — that the fall might not be deemed as total, but in part; it was<span class="lang el-gr">ἣττημα, </span> a less part, a diminution, a lessening of their number in God’s kingdom. A contrast to this is the<span class="lang el-gr">πλήρωμα, </span> the full or complete portion, that is, their complete restoration, as it is said in <span class="bvs">Rom_11:26</span>. To preserve the antithesis, the first word must have its literal meaning, a diminution or lessening, that is, as to the number saved. [<span class="bvs">Hammond </span>] renders the phrase, “their paucity.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
