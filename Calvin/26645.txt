<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>For I have given you an example. </em>It deserves our attention that Christ says that he <em>gave an example</em>; for we are not at liberty to take all his actions, without reserve, as subjects of imitation. The Papists boast that, by Christ’s example, they observe the forty days’ fast, or Lent. But we ought first to see whether or not he intended to lay down his fast as an example that the disciples might conform to it as a rule. We read: nothing of this sort, and, therefore, the imitation of it is not less wicked than if they attempted to fly to heaven. Besides, when they ought to have followed Christ, they were not imitators, but apes. Every year they have a fashion of washing some people’s feet, as if it were a farce which they were playing on the stage; <span class="cite-ref">(48)</span> and so, when they have performed this idle and unmeaning ceremony, they think that they have fully discharged their duty, and reckon themselves at liberty to despise their brethren during the rest of the year. <span class="cite-ref">(49)</span> But — what is far worse <span class="cite-ref">(50)</span> — after having washed the feet of twelve men, they subject every member of Christ to cruel torture, and thus spit in Christ’s face. This display of buffoonery, therefore, is nothing else than a shameful mockery of Christ. At all events, Christ does not here enjoin an annual ceremony, but bids us be ready, throughout our whole life, to wash the feet of our brethren and neighbors. <span class="cite-ref">(51)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(48)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme s’ils jouyoient une farce sur des eschaffauts</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(49)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tout le reste de l’an</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(50)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il y a bien pis</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(51)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De nos fi,eres et prochains</span>.” </p></div></div>
