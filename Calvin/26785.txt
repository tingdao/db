<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>And I have declared to them thy name, and will declare it. </em>Christ discharged the office of Teacher, but, in order to make known the Father, he employed the secret revelation of the Spirit, and not the sound of his voice alone. He means, therefore, that he taught the apostles efficaciously. Besides, their faith being at that time very weak, he promises greater progress for the future, and thus prepares them to expect more abundant grace of the Holy Spirit. Though he speaks of the apostles, we ought to draw from this a general exhortation, to study to make constant progress, and not to think that we have run so well that we have not still a long journey before us, so long as we are surrounded by the flesh. </p><p><em>That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them; </em>that is, that thou mayest love them in me, or, that <em>the love with which thou hast loved me </em>may be extended to them; for, strictly speaking, <em>the love with which God loves </em>us is no other than that <em>with which he loved </em>his Son from the beginning, so as to render us also acceptable to him, and capablc of being <em>loved </em>in Christ. And, indeed, as was said a little before, so far as relates to us, apart from Christ, we are hated by God, and he only begins to love us, when we are united to the body of his beloved Son. It is an invaluable privilege of faith, that we know that Christ was <em>loved </em>by the Father on our account, that we might be made partakers of the same love, and might enjoy it for ever. </p><p><em>And I in them. </em>This clause deserves our attention, for it teaches us that the only way in which we are included in that love which he mentions is, that Christ dwells in us; for, as the Father cannot look upon his Son without having likewise before his eyes the whole body of Christ, <em>so, </em>if we wish to be beheld in him, we must be actually his members. </p></div>
