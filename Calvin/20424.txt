<div class="comment-content"><p>This verse is harshly explained by many, for they think that the daughter of the people is called cruel, because she acted towards her children as serpents do to their young ones. But this meaning is not suitable, for the word <span class="lang he-il">בת</span>, <em>beth, </em>is well known to be feminine. He says that the daughter of the people had come to a savage or cruel one, the latter word is masculine. Then the Prophet seems to mean that the whelps (such is the word) of serpents are more kindly dealt with than the Jews. Serpents are void of all humanity, yet they nourish their brood and give them the breast,. Hence the Prophet by this comparison amplifies the miseries of the people, that their condition was worse than that of serpents, for the tender brood are nourished by their mothers; but the people were without any help, so that they in vain implored the protection of their mother and of others. ‘We now see the real meaning of the Prophet. </p><p>The particle <span class="lang he-il">גם</span>, <em>gam</em>, is emphatical; for had he spoken of animals, such as are careful to nourish their young, it would not have been so wonderful; but so great seems to be the savageness and barbarity of serpents, that they might be expected to east away their brood. Now he says that <em>even serpents draw out the breast </em>The Jews say that the breasts of serpents are covered with scales, as though they were hidden; but this is one of their figments. It is a common phrase, taken from t common practice; for a woman draws out the breast when she gives suck to her infant; so serpents are said to draw out the breast when they give suck to their whelps; for <span class="lang he-il">גורים</span>, <em>gurim</em>, are the whelps of lions or of bears; but in this place the word is applied to serpents. <em>The daughter, </em>then, <em>of my people has come to the cruel one, </em>for the people had to do with nothing but cruelty, there being no one to bring them help or to succor them in their miseries. He, then, does not accuse the people of cruelty, that they did not nourish their children, but on the contrary he means that they were given up to cruel enemies. <span class="cite-ref">(209)</span></p><p><em>As the ostriches, </em>or the owls, he says, in the wilderness. If we understand the ostrich to be intended, we know that bird to be very stupid; for as soon as she lays an egg, she forgets and leaves it. The comparison, then, would be suitable, were the daughter of the people said to be cruel, because she neglected her children; but the Prophet, as I think, means, on the contrary, that the Jews were so destitute of every help, as though they were banished into solitary places beyond the sight of men; for birds in solitude in vain seek the help of others. As, then, the ostrich Or the owl has in the desert no one to bring it help, and is without its own mother, so the Prophet intimates that there was no one to stretch forth a hand to the distressed people to relieve their extreme miseries. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(209)</strong> The reference here is to the conduct of mothers, called here “the daughter of my people,” as it appears evident from the following verse, — </p><p>Even dragons have drawn out the breast, <LineBreak />They have suckled their young ones: <LineBreak />The daughter of my people <em>has been </em>for cruelty <LineBreak />Like the ostriches in the desert. </p><p>It is said that the ostrich lays her eggs and forsakes them. See <span class="bvs">Job_39:15</span>. The verb, to be, is understood, as the case often is, but it must ever be in the same tense as the verb or verbs connected with the sentence. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
