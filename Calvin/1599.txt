<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>And I am sure that the king of Egypt. </em>God forearms his people, lest, suffering a repulse at their first onset, they should retire, and abandon in despair the work enjoined to them. It was, indeed, a hard thing to hear that their expedition would be vain; and that they might as well address themselves to the trunk of a tree, since there was no hope of reaching the obstinate heart of Pharaoh; but they would have been much more discouraged by this trial, if his stubbornness had been discovered unexpectedly. Therefore God foretells that their words would avail nothing; but at the same time he announces that he should succeed by his own wondrous power. If any think it absurd for these unhappy men to be wearied by their useless labor, and to be repulsed with ridicule and insult, I answer, that this was for the sake of example, and that it was advantageous for setting forth God’s glory, that the king, having been civilly applied to, should betray his impious perversity, since nothing could be more just than that what he had unjustly refused, should be extorted from him against his will. But interpreters differ as to the meaning of the words. For some translate it literally from the Hebrew, “no, not by a mighty hand;” as though God said that the pride of the king would be unconquerable, and not to be subdued by any power or force; but the context requires a different sense, because the remedy is afterwards opposed to it, “and I will stretch out my hand;” and the result is added, that Pharaoh, overcome at length by the plagues, would let the people go. And this view is grammatically correct; for the Hebrews use the word <span class="lang he-il">ולא</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(45)</span><em>velo</em>, for “except.” Therefore God commands his people to be firm and confident, although Pharaoh may not immediately obey; because he would evidence his power <span class="cite-ref">(46)</span> in a remarkable manner for their deliverance. In the meantime he arouses them to hope by the promise of a successful issue; since he will forcibly compel Pharaoh to yield. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(45)</span><span class="lang he-il">ולא</span> is here rendered <em>unless </em>by the LXX., Vulgate, Pagninus, Luther, Vatablus, and Diodati; and by the equivalent, <em>but </em>in the margin of <em>A V S.M</em>. has <em>neque</em>; but adds, “alii exponunt <span class="lang he-il">ולא</span> pro nisi.” — <em>W </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(46)</span> Il a delibere de faire un chef-d’oeuvre. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
