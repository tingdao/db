<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here expresses more clearly what he had briefly referred to by the word <em>poor</em>, and by the metaphor which we have explained. Hence he says, that there would be no horses, no chariots, no bows, no warlike instruments in Christ’s kingdom; for tranquillity would prevail in it. The sum of the whole is, that Christ and his people would not be kept safe and secure by human defences, by means of many soldiers and of similar helps being at hand; but that God would restrain, and even compose and allay all warlike commotions, so that there would be no need of such aids. We now understand the Prophet’s design. </p><p>But we must notice the language here used. God declares here that he would be the giver of peace, so that the Messiah would continue safe in his kingdom; <em>I will cut off</em>, he says; for it might have been objected — “If he is to be poor, what hope can there be of safety?” The answer is, because it will be God’s work to restrain all the assaults of enemies. He means, in short, that the Messiah’s kingdom would be safe, because God from heaven would check all the rage of enemies, so that however disposed they might be to do harm, they would yet find themselves held captive by the hidden bridle of God, so as not to be able to move a finger. </p><p>But after having said that the Jews and Israelites would be safe, though stripped naked of all defences, he adds, <em>He will speak peace to the nations</em>; that is, though he will not use threats or terrors, nor bring forth great armies, yet the nations will obey him; for there will be no need of employing any force. To speak peace then to the nations means, that they will calmly hear, though not terrified nor threatened. Some with more ingenuity make the meaning to be that Christ, who reconciles the Father to us, will proclaim this favor of reconciliation; but the Prophet, as I think, with more simplicity, says, that Christ would be content with his own word, inasmuch as the Gentiles would become obedient, and quietly submit to his authority. <span class="cite-ref">(106)</span> The import of the whole is, that Christ would so rule far and wide, that the farthest would live contentedly under his protection, and not cast off the yoke laid on them. </p><p>He states in the last place, that his dominion would be <em>from sea to sea</em>, that is, from the Red sea to the Syrian sea, towards Cilicia, <em>and from the river</em>, that is, Euphrates, <em>to the extreme borders of the earth</em>. By the earth we are not to understand the whole world, as some interpreters have unwisely said; for the Prophet no doubt mentioned those places already known to the Jews. For we know that remarkable oracle — </p><p>“He shall reign from sea to sea.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_72:8</span>.) </p><p>But God speaks of David only, and the words are the same as here; and there was no oracle more commonly known among the Jews. <span class="cite-ref">(107)</span> The Prophet, then, who adduces here nothing new, only reminds the Jews of what they had long ago heard, and repeats, as it were, word for word, what was familiar to them all. For we must bear in mind what I said at the beginning — that the Prophet here strengthens the minds of the godly, and on this account, because the Messiah, on whose coming was founded the gratuitous adoption of the people, as well as their hope of salvation, had not yet appeared. We now then understand the real meaning of this passage. He then adds — </p><p><strong>(106)</strong> To “speak peace” is to anounce or proclaim peace, and not to produce peace. It is not to render people peaceable, but to declare the message of peace to them. It it the promulgation of the gospel. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(107)</strong> The reference as to the “sea” may be also made to <span class="bvs">Exo_23:31</span>; and as to the “river” to <span class="bvs">Deu_11:24</span>. The land promised to the Israelites is no doubt what is here described,” and <em>Newcome </em>renders the last clause “to the uttermost part of the land.” Though <em>Henderson </em>admits that the words are originally “descriptive of the utmost bound of the Hebrew kingdom,” yet he thinks that they are to be taken here in their widest meaning, as including the whole earth. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
