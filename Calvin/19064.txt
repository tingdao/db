<div class="comment-content"><p>He now adds, <em>I will go to the great </em>By the great he meant the priests and the prophets, as well as the king’s counselors, and the king himself. <em>I will go, </em><span class="cite-ref">(132)</span> then, he says, <em>to the great, and will speak to them </em>It is the same as though he had said, that everywhere his labor was in vain, for not only he spoke to the deaf when addressing the illiterate vulgar, but also when addressing the chief men. I have said, that the Prophet did not make the inquiry as one doubtful, but his purpose was to make the chief men ashamed of themselves, and also to confirm what he had said before, — that not one just and upright man could be found in Jerusalem. </p><p><em>For they know, </em>he says, etc. He declares the same thing in the same words. But we must ever remember, that the Prophet did not believe this; but he speaks of it as a thing that appeared probable: for who could have then thought that there was so much ignorance in the chief men? for they were in great esteem among the people. Since then the opinion prevailed, that all those who were rulers were well acquainted with the law, Jeremiah speaks according to what was commonly thought, and says, that they knew the <em>way of Jehovah </em></p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>But </em>(for <span class="lang he-il">אך</span>, <em>ak, </em>is to be taken here adversatively, and its proper meaning is, nay or but) <em>they have alike broken the yoke, they have burst the bonds; </em>that is, “If any one thinks that the rulers are better than the common people, he is much deceived; for I have proofs enough to shew that their conduct is the same; they have broken the yoke of God no less than the most ignorant.” By this repetition he more fully confirmed their defection, and at the same time reminded them how shameful it was, that prophets, priests, and rulers, who occupied the first places in the state, had become so unbridled in their vices. It follows — </p><p><strong>(132)</strong> Literally it is, “I will go for myself,” — an idiomatic form of speech. The <em>Welsh </em>is exactly the same, (lang. cy) <em>af rhagof </em><em>; </em>which means, I will go forth; but it cannot be literally expressed in another language. After the verb, as in Hebrew, there is a preposition prefixed to “me.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
