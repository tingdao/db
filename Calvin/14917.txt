<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Why leap ye, </em><span class="cite-ref">(32)</span><em>ye high hills? </em>In this verse there is no obscurity or ambiguity. David having said that there was only one mountain in all the world which God had chosen, calls upon the highest hills to yield it the pre-eminency. As he repeats in the plural number what had been said immediately before of Bashan, this leads me to think that he intended first to oppose that mountain, and then all other high mountains generally, to Zion. <span class="cite-ref">(33)</span> Mountains are here to be understood figuratively, and the great truth conveyed is, that the kingdom of Christ, which God had begun to shadow forth in the person of David, far excels all that is reckoned glorious by the world. The reproof which the Psalmist administers, in order to humble the proud boasting of the world, is justified by that contempt which we know that carnal and ungodly persons entertain of Christ’s kingdom, devoted as they are to their own pleasures or wealth, and unable to appreciate spiritual blessings. The lesson will be felt to be the more useful and necessary, if we consider that this vain pride of man rises to an additional height, when the slightest occasion is afforded for its exercise. When we see those indulging it who have no grounds to do so, we need not wonder at the arrogance of such as are possessed of wealth and influence. But the Lord’s people may afford to leave them to their self-complacency, resting satisfied with the privilege of knowing that God has chosen to take up his habitation in the midst of them. They have no reason to repine at their lot so long as they have union with God, the only and the sufficient source of their happiness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(32)</span> The word here rendered <em>leap ye </em>“occurs only here,” observes Hammond, “and is by guess rendered <em>to leap</em>, or <em>lift up</em>, or <em>exalt </em>one’s self; but may best be interpreted, not <em>leap </em>as an expression of joy, but <em>lift up</em>, or <em>exalt </em>yourselves, as an effect of pride;” and he understands the meaning to be, Why do ye lift up or exalt yourselves, ye high hills, God not having chosen any of the highest hills to build his temple on, but the hill of Zion, of a very moderate size, lower than the hill of Hermon, and at the foot of it, (<span class="bvs">Psa_133:3</span>.) Some Jewish commentators, founding their opinion on the cognate Arabic word <span class="lang he-il">רצר</span>, would render it, <em>to look after </em>This gives the same sense. What look ye for? what expect ye, ye high hills, to be done to you? Ye are not those which God has chosen to beautify with his glorious presence, but mount Zion is the object of his choice. Aquila and Jerome read, “Why contend ye?” Dr Chandler renders it, “Why look askance?” <em>i e</em>. , “with jealous leer malign,” as Milton expresses it. “Why are ye jealous?” Horsley, following Jerome, has, “For what would ye contend?” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(33)</span> “The Psalmist,” says Horsley, “having settled the Israelites between their hills, proceeds to the circumstance of God’s choice of a hill for the site of his temple. He poetically imagines the different hills as all ambitious of the honor, anxiously waiting God’s decision, and ready to enter into a jealous contention; <em>watching each other with an anxious eye</em>. The lofty hill of Bashan first puts in his claim, pleading his stately height — </p><p>The hill for God is the hill of Bashan; <LineBreak />A hill of lofty brows is the hill of Bashan. </p><p>The Psalmist cuts short the contention — </p><p>For what would ye contend, ye hills of lofty brows? <LineBreak />This is the hill desired of God for himself to dwell in; <LineBreak />Yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever.” </p></div></div>
