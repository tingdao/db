<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>And this is the will of him who sent me. </em>He had said that the Father had committed to him the protection of our salvation; and now he likewise describes the manner in which it is accomplished. The way to obtain salvation, therefore, is to obey the Gospel of Christ. This point he had, indeed, glanced at a little before but now he expresses more fully what he had spoken somewhat obscurely. And if it is the will of God that those whom he has elected shall be saved, and if in this manner he ratifies and executes his eternal decree, whoever he be that is not satisfied with Christ, but indulges in curious inquiries about eternal predestination, such a person, as far as lies in his power, desires to be saved contrary to the purpose of God. The election of God is in itself hidden and secret; the Lord manifests it <em>by calling</em>, that is, when he bestows on us this blessing <em>of calling us </em><span class="cite-ref">(146)</span></p><p>They are madmen, therefore, who seek their own salvation or that of others in the whirlpool of predestination, not keeping the way of salvation which is exhibited to them. Nay more, by this foolish speculation, they endeavor to overturn the force and effect of predestination; for if God has elected us to this end, that we may believe, take away faith, and election will be imperfect. But we have no right to break through the order and succession of the beginning and the end, since God, by his purpose, hath decreed and determined <em>that </em>it shall proceed unbroken. <span class="cite-ref">(147)</span> Besides, as the election of God, by an indissoluble bond, draws his calling along with it, so when God has effectually called us to faith in Christ, let this have as much weight with us as if he had engraven his seal to ratify his decree concerning our salvation. For the testimony of the Holy Spirit is nothing else than the sealing of our adoption, (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:15</span>.) To every man, therefore, his faith is a sufficient attestation of the eternal predestination of God, so that it would be a shocking sacrilege <span class="cite-ref">(148)</span> to carry the inquiry farther; for that man offers an aggravated insult to the Holy Spirit, who refuses to assent to his simple testimony. </p><p><em>Whosoever seeth the Son, and believeth in him. </em>He uses the words, <em>see and believe, </em>in contrast with what he had formerly said; for he had reproached the Jews with <em>not believing</em>, <em>even though they saw</em>, (verse 36.) But now, speaking of the sons of God, with the feeling which they have of the power of God in Christ, he joins the obedience of faith. Moreover, these words show that faith proceeds from the knowledge of Christ; not that it desires anything beyond the simple word of God, but because, if we trust in Christ, we must perceive what he is, and what he brings to us. </p><p><strong>(146)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, quand il nous fait ce bien de nous appeler</span>.” </p><p><strong>(147)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Or ne nous est-il permis de rompre l’ordre et la suite du commencement avec la fin, puis que Dieu par son conseil l’a ainsi ordonne et voulu que cela allast d’un fil</span>.” </p><p><strong>(148)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Un sacrilege horrible</span>.” </p></div>
