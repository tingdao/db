<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>But they rejoiced at my halting. </em>I see no reason why interpreters should trouble themselves as they do about the word <em>halting. </em>Some conjecture that David had his leg put out of joint, and others suppose that he halted from some disease. But when we consider carefully the whole passage, nothing is more evident than that he refers by this expression to the calamities which befell him; as if he had said, As soon as they saw me begin to stagger and ready to fall, they did as it were gather together against me, and endeavored entirely to overthrow me. There is, therefore, in this expression almost the same metaphor as we have already seen in the word <em>sickness. </em>Now, as men often relent at seeing the misfortunes of their enemies, so that they cease to hate or persecute those who are already miserably wretched, it was an evidence of the very cruel and fierce spirit by which David’s former friends were actuated against him, when, upon seeing him cast down and afflicted, they were rather by this incited furiously and insolently to assail him. At the commencement he speaks only of a few; but immediately after, in order to show still farther the indignity which had been done to him, he adds to them the base and ignoble of the common people; not that he blames all alike, but that he may the better show with what bitter hostility he was assailed on all sides. It is probable that those who were then in power were as it were firebrands, who endeavored to kindle every where the flame of hatred against David, that the people every where might rise up to destroy him, and strive with each other in this enterprise. And he repeats twice <em>that they gathered themselves together, </em>in order to show how resolute and determined they were in their opposition to him; unless, perhaps, some would prefer to explain the words thus: They gathered themselves together, not only those who had some pretext for doing so, but even the lowest of the people. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">נכים</span>, <em>nekim, </em>literally signifies <em>the whipped, </em>or <em>beaten, </em><span class="cite-ref">(712)</span> but it is here to be understood as denoting base and disreputable persons. Some interpreters, indeed, derive it from the word <span class="lang he-il">כאה</span>, <em>kaäh, </em>which signifies <em>to make sad, </em>and expound it actively, Those who make me sad: but the previous interpretation agrees better with the design of the passage, namely, that David was shamefully treated by the lowest dregs of the people. The words, <em>I knew not, </em>may be referred to the cause as well as to the persons. I, however, explain it as referring to the persons in this sense: So far from having any cause to complain that I have offended them, or done them any harm, I did not even know them. At the same time, these words may be understood as implying a complaint on the part of David, that the people were enraged against him without any cause, since he is conscious of no crime, and can conceive of no ground for such fierce hatred towards him. As to the last clause of the verse, also, although interpreters entertain different opinions, it appears to me that I have given the true and natural meaning. Literally it is, <em>they did cut, and ceased not; </em>but there can be no doubt that the language is metaphorical, and that the word <em>cut </em><span class="cite-ref">(713)</span> signifies that they opened their mouth; as if David had said, They have insolently poured forth with open mouth their scoffing and reproachful words against me. The additional clause in the sentence, <em>and ceased not, </em>is a repetition common in the Hebrew language, and is employed to express the vehemence with which David’s enemies proceeded against him. It implies that there was no end or measure to their evil-speaking, and that they continued to pour forth with distended throats whatever first occurred to them. </p><p><strong>(712)</strong> The word is derived from <span class="lang he-il">נכה</span>, <em>nakah, to strike </em>or <em>to smite. </em>The LXX. render it <span class="lang el-gr">μαστιγες</span>, <em>scourges; </em>and <em>Jerome </em>reads <em>percutientes </em><em>, smiters, </em>in which he is followed by <em>Ainsworth</em>, who understands the word as meaning smiters with the tongue, or calumniators, and who thinks that the LXX., in translating it <em>scourges, </em>alluded to the scourge of the tongue, as in <span class="bvs">Job_5:21</span>; and if <em>smiters </em>is the proper rendering, we may certainly conclude, that as this smiting is represented as done upon the person who was its object in his absence, it was a smiting by the tongue. At the same time, this critic observes, that the word may be read <em>the smitten, </em>that is, <em>abjects, vile persons, </em>as in <span class="bvs">Job_30:8</span><em>Dr Kennicott </em>translates it by <em>verbcrones, whipt slaves, vile scoundrels. </em>Another meaning of the word, according to <em>Buxtorff</em>, is, <em>the wry-legged, the lame. </em>In this sense it is used in <span class="bvs">2Sa_4:4</span>, and 9:3; and hence the epithet of <em>Necho </em>was given to one of the Pharaohs, who halted in his gait. Thus it easily came to be employed as a term of contempt. Calvin and the translators of our English Bible agree in the meaning which they attach to this word. </p><p><strong>(713)</strong> The verb <span class="lang he-il">קרע</span>, <em>kara, </em>for <em>cut, </em>“is significant of tearing or rending, and by an easy metaphor, is applicable to wounds inflicted by evil speaking and slander.” — <em>Walford. </em></p></div>
