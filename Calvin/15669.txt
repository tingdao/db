<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17</strong><em>The earth opened </em>The heinousness of their sin may be seen in the magnitude of the punishment by which it was visited. But the design of the prophet was to accuse and reprove publicly the obstinacy of the people, who, so far from being bettered by their corrections, (although the vengeance of God was so terrible as almost to move the very stones,) conducted themselves the more perversely. That was surely an awfully ominous event, when <em>the earth swallowed up alive Dathan and Abiram, </em>and all their accomplices; and when fire coming down from heaven consumed <span class="cite-ref">(248)</span> them, according to the saying of Moses, </p><p>“If any thing common happen to these men, then believe not that God who ruleth in heaven rules over you and me; but if this new and extraordinary thing happen, namely, that the earth open her mouth and swallow them up, then indeed believe that I am sent by God,” <span class="bvs">Num_16:29</span></p><p>When the Israelites were so infatuated as to rise in rebellion against God, then did the terrible nature of their distemper appear in that it could not be cured by the stringent remedy which was applied to it. And as even hypocrites are afraid when they feel the severity of God, it was the height of folly in them to fret and quarrel with God where he was visiting their iniquities with stripes. Should any one ask why God charges the faults of a few upon the whole body of the people? the answer is obvious; for although there were only two individuals who were the principal abettors of the conspiracy, and along with them two hundred and seventy seditious persons, yet it would seem, from the murmurings and cavillings of the whole congregation, that they also were affected with the same distemper. The punishment did not extend beyond the captains <span class="cite-ref">(249)</span> and ringleaders of this wicked conspiracy, it being the design of God to mitigate it, and to spare the people at large, who nevertheless had been most desirous of innovation, seeing they could not endure the authority of Moses and Aaron. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(248)</span> The fire consumed two hundred and fifty, and fourteen thousand and seven hundred died of the plague. — <span class="bvs">Num_16:35</span>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(249)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Capitaines et portenseignes</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
