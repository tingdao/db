<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>But I say to you </em>His reply is not opposed to the command of Moses, (<span class="bvs">Exo_20:13</span>; <span class="bvs">Lev_24:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Num_35:16</span>;) but to the interpretation usually put upon it by the scribes. Now, as the Pharisees boasted of antiquity, (for it is always the custom to plead the prescription of a long period in defense of errors,) <span class="cite-ref">(398)</span> Christ reminds the people of his authority, to which all antiquity ought justly to give way. Hence we conclude, that truth is of greater weight than custom or the number of years. </p><p><em>He who shall say to his brother </em>Christ assigns three degrees of condemnation besides the violence of the hands; which implies, that this precept of the law restrains not only the hands, but all affections that are opposed to brotherly love. “Those who shall only be angry with their brethren, or treat them with haughty disdain, or injure them by any reproach, are murderers.” Now, as it is certain that the word <em>Racha </em>occupies an intermediate place between <em>anger </em>and openly reproachful language, I have no doubt that it is an interjection of contempt or disdain. Though Christ adjudges <em>to the hell of fire </em>none but those who break out into open reproach, we must not suppose, that he declares <em>anger </em>to be free from a similar punishment; but, alluding to earthly judgments, he assures them that God will judge and punish even concealed <em>anger. </em><span class="cite-ref">(399)</span> But, as he who manifests his indignation by bitter language goes farther than this, Christ says, that that man will be held guilty by the<em>whole heavenly council, </em>that he may receive severer punishment. </p><p>Those, again, who break out into reproaches are adjudged <em>to the hell of fire: </em>which implies, that hatred, and every thing that is contrary to love, is enough to expose them to eternal death, though they may have committed no acts of violence. <span class="lang el-gr">Γἔεννα </span> (<em>hell</em>) is, beyond all question, a foreign word. <span class="lang he-il">גיא</span> (<em>Ge</em>) is the Hebrew word for a valley. Now, “the valley of Hin-nom” was infamous for the detestable superstition which was committed in it, because there they sacrificed their children to idols, (<span class="bvs">2Ch_33:6</span>.) The consequence was, that holy men, in order to excite stronger hatred of that wicked ungodliness, used it as the name for <em>hell, </em>that the very name might be dreaded by the people as shocking and alarming. It would appear that, in the time of Christ, this was a received way of speaking, and that <em>hell </em>was then called by no other name than <em>gehenna, ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">γέεννα</span><em>,) </em>the word being slightly altered from the true pronunciation. </p><p><strong>(398)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour maintenir et defendre les erreurs ou abus en la matiere de la religion</span>;” — “to maintain and defend errors or abuses in matters of religion.” </p><p><strong>(399)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">L'indignation secrette qu'on aura eue en son coeur contre le frere</span>;” —”the secret indignation which they shall have had in their heart against their brother.” </p></div>
