He enumerates three classes of them. </p><p><em>He is truly a Prophet. </em>The first acknowledged that Jesus <em>was truly a Prophet</em>, from which we infer that they did not dislike his doctrine. But, on the other hand, how light and trifling this confession was, is evident from the fact, that, while they approve of the Teacher, they neither understand what he means, nor relish what he says; for they could not truly receive him <em>as a Prophet</em>, without, at the same time, acknowledging that he is the Son of God and the Author of their salvation. Yet this is good in them, that they perceive in Christ something Divine, which leads them to regard him with reverence; for this willingness to learn might afterwards give an easy opening to faith. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(200)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De mortelle haine</span>.” </p></div></div>
