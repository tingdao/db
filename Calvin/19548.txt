<div class="comment-content"><p>He confirms what he had said before when he says, that he would <em>bring </em>all his <em>words </em>on the Chaldeans; that is, that he would give effect to all the prophecies, so that it would be evident that Jeremiah had foretold nothing rashly, and that God had not in vain threatened them by the mouth of his servant. Such is the meaning, and hence we see what the Prophet intimates when he says, that God would bring all his words, for he had then spoken. But as the ungodly regard whatever is brought forward in God’s name as a matter of sport and mockery, and boldly deride all threatenings, to <em>bring words </em>means the same thing with proving by events that God does not terrify men without accomplishing his words; in short, to bring words is to prove their authority. And, as I have said, the expression has a reference to the insensibility of men who give no credit to God’s words until they are convinced by their accomplishment; for they think that the air only is beaten, and thus they are not touched by any fear. But God proves the power of his word when he executes what he has predicted. </p><p>We then see that the Prophet intends nothing else in this verse than to confirm what he had said before. And he speaks of Chaldea and says, <em>upon that land </em></p><p>And we must at the same time notice another form of speaking; for God says, that he had pronounced these <em>words; </em>he afterwards says, that Jeremiah was his minister, and as it were his herald; and he calls him also a scribe or a writer. God then here declares that he was the author of all that Jeremiah had brought forward; and yet he leaves his own office to his minister, for it is necessary to secure authority to the prophets; otherwise, except God visibly descended from heaven, men would either indiscriminately admit what might be said, and without judgment receive falsehood and truth, or they would become wholly hardened, so as to give no credit to prophetic instruction. He says, <em>whatsoever is written in this book </em>The Prophet no doubt wrote down a summary of what he had delivered; for as we have said elsewhere, it was usual with the prophets, after they had spoken at large to the people and preached diffusely, to affix a short summary to the doors of the Temple. This volume then is what Jeremiah calls the book, which was composed from his public addresses. It might in common language be called a summary. Then he adds, <em>in what, </em>or, “what he prophesied,” <span class="cite-ref">(133)</span> in order to shew that he meant what he had before said; and so it might be rendered, that is, what he prophesied; but the other exposition is not unsuitable, <em>in which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations </em>It follows, — </p><p><strong>(133)</strong> Had the book been intended, the <span class="lang he-il">אשר</span>, which, would have been followed by a pronoun after the verb with the preposition <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, in, prefixed to it; for this is the idiom of the language. All the versions render the phrase, “whatever Jeremiah prophesied,” etc. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
