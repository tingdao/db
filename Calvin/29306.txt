<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>And walk in love as Christ also hath loved us. </em>Having called on us to imitate God, he now calls on us to imitate Christ, who is our true model. We ought to embrace each other with that love with which Christ has embraced us, for what we perceive in Christ is our true guide. </p><p><em>And gave himself for us. </em>This was a remarkable proof of the highest love. Forgetful, as it were, of himself, Christ spared not his own life, that he might redeem us from death. If we desire to be partakers of this benefit, we must cultivate similar affections toward our neighbors. Not that any of us has reached such high perfection, but all must aim and strive according to the measure of their ability. </p><p><em>An offering and a sacrifice to God of a sweet smelling savor. </em>While this statement leads us to admire the grace of Christ, it bears directly on the present subject. No language, indeed, can fully represent the consequences and efficacy of Christ’s death. This is the only price by which we are reconciled to God. The doctrine of faith on this subject holds the highest rank. But the more extraordinary the discoveries which have reached us of the Redeemer’s kindness, the more strongly are we bound to his service. Besides, we may infer from Paul’s words, that, unless we love one another, none of our duties will be acceptable in the sight of God. If the reconciliation of men, effected by Christ, was <em>a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor, </em><span class="cite-ref">(154)</span> we, too, shall be “unto God a sweet savor,” (<span class="bvs">2Co_2:15</span>,) when this holy perfume is spread over us. To this applies the saying of Christ, </p><p>“Leave thy gift before the altar, and go and be reconciled to thy brother.” (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:24</span>.) </p><p><strong>(154)</strong> “The offering, in being presented to God, was meant to be, and actually was, a sweet savor to Him. The phrase is based on the peculiar sacrificial idiom of the Old Testament. (<span class="bvs">Gen_8:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Lev_1:9</span>.) It is used typically in <span class="bvs">2Co_2:14</span>, and is explained and expanded in <span class="bvs">Phi_4:18</span> — ‘a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.’ The burning of spices or incense, so fragrant to the Oriental senses, is figuratively applied to God.” — Eadie. </p></div>
