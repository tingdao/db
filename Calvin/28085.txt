<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>But thanks be to God</em>, <em>etc. </em>This is an application of the similitude of the present subject. Though they were only to be reminded that they were not now the servants of sin, he yet adds a thanksgiving; first, that he might teach them, that this was not through their own merit, but through the special mercy of God; and secondly, that by this thanksgiving, they might learn how great was the kindness of God, and that they might thereby be more stimulated to hate sin. And he gives thanks, not as to that time during which they were the servants of sin, but for the liberation which followed, when they ceased to be what they were before. But this implied comparison between their former and present state is very emphatical; for the Apostle touches the calumniators of the grace of Christ, when he shows, that without grace the whole race of man is held captive under the dominion of sin; but that the kingdom of sin comes to an end, as soon as grace puts forth its power. <span class="cite-ref">(196)</span></p><p>We may hence learn, that we are not freed from the bondage of the law that we may sin; for the law does not lose its dominion, until the grace of God restores us to him, in order to renew us in righteousness: and it is hence impossible that we should be subject to sin, when the grace of God reigns in us: for we have before stated, that under this term grace, is included the spirit of regeneration. </p><p><em>You have obeyed from the heart</em>, <em>etc. </em>Paul compares here the hidden power of the Spirit with the external letter of the law, as though he had said, “Christ inwardly forms our souls in a better way, than when the law constrains them by threatening and terrifying us.” Thus is dissipated the following calumny, “If Christ frees us from subjection to the law, he brings liberty to sin.” He does not indeed allow his people unbridled freedom, that they might frisk about without any restraint, like horses let loose in the fields; but he brings them to a regular course of life. — Though [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>], following the old version, has chosen to translate it the “form” (formam) <em>of doctrine</em>, I have felt constrained to retain<em>type</em>, the word which Paul uses: some may perhaps prefer the word pattern. <span class="cite-ref">(197)</span> It seems indeed to me to denote the formed image or impress of that righteousness which Christ engraves on our hearts: and this corresponds with the prescribed rule of the law, according to which all our actions ought to be framed, so that they deviate not either to the right or to the left hand. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(196)</span> Our version of this verse conveys the idea, that the Apostle gave thanks that they had been the servants of sin; but<span class="lang el-gr">ὅτι </span> is often rendered<em>for</em>, as in <span class="bvs">Mat_5:3</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_10:13</span>; and in <span class="bvs">Mat_6:5</span>, followed by<span class="lang el-gr">δὲ </span> as here, in <span class="bvs">Rom_6:6</span>. The rendering may be this, — </p><p>But thanks be to God; for ye have been the servants of sin, but have obeyed the form of doctrine, in which ye have been taught. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(197)</span> The version of Calvin is, “Obedistis vero et animo typo doctrinæ in quem traducti estis.” </p><p>The word<span class="lang el-gr">τύπος, </span> is rendered in <span class="bvs">Joh_20:25</span>, <em>print</em>, that is, of the nails, — in <span class="bvs">Act_7:43</span>, in the plural, <em>fiqures</em>, that is, images, — in <span class="bvs">Act_7:44</span>, <em>fashion</em>, that is, pattern or model, — in <span class="bvs">Heb_8:5</span>, <em>pattern</em>, — in <span class="bvs">Act_23:25</span>, <em>manner</em>, that is, form, — in <span class="bvs">Rom_5:14</span>, <em>figure</em>, that is, representative, — in <span class="cite-note">Titus 2:7</span>,<em>pattern; </em>and in all other instances in which it occurs, except in this place, it is rendered<em>example</em>, and in the plural, <em>examp1es</em>, as afforded by the conduct of others, or by events; see <span class="bvs">1Co_10:6</span>; <span class="bvs">Phi_3:17</span>; <span class="bvs">1Th_1:7</span>; <span class="bvs">2Th_3:9</span>; <span class="bvs">1Ti_4:12</span>; <span class="bvs">1Pe_5:3</span>. The idea of <em>mould</em>, which some give to it, is without an example in the New Testament. </p><p>Our version is that of [<span class="bvs">Castellio </span>], in the meaning of which most critics agree. [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] gives this paraphrase, “Obedistis ad eum modum quem doctrina evangelii præscribit — Ye became obedient to that rule which the doctrine of the gospel prescribes.” [<span class="bvs">Wolfius </span>] quotes from [<span class="bvs">Iamblichus </span>], in his life of [<span class="bvs">Pythagoras </span>], passages in which<span class="lang el-gr">τύπος </span> is used for <em>form, model, </em>or <em>manner </em><span class="lang el-gr">, —”τὢς παιδεύσεως ὁ τύπος </span> — the form of instruction;” and<span class="lang el-gr">“τύπος διδασκαλίας </span> — the form or manner of teaching.” </p><p>The grammatical difficulty is best removed by [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>], who considers<span class="lang el-gr">τύπον </span> to be for τυπω, the case being changed by the preceding pronoun, no uncommon thing in Greek: the literal rendering would then be, —”Ye have obeyed the form of doctrine, respecting which (or, in which, see <span class="bvs">Mar_5:34</span>) ye have been instructed.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
