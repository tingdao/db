<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet also mentions particularly who they were; they were men and <em>women and children </em>Some render the last word “puberty,” which I do not approve, since Scripture speaks thus of children. Then John and his associates took <em>childhood, </em>or children; and he adds, <em>the daughters of the king </em>We have before inquired who these daughters of the king were: the probability is that they were his daughters by his concubines; and that they had been put in some safe place, so that if any great evil happened, they might not fall into the hands of enemies. Then these daughters of the king had returned with the other exiles, but were afterwards carried into Egypt. </p></div>
