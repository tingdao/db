<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Whosoever shall humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. </em>This is intended to guard us against supposing that we degrade ourselves in any measure by freely surrendering every kind of distinction. And hence we may obtain a short definition <span class="cite-ref">(500)</span> of humility. That man is truly humble who neither claims any personal merit in the sight of God, nor proudly despises brethren, or aims at being thought superior to them, but reckons it enough that he is one of the members of Christ, and desires nothing more than that the Head alone should be exalted. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(500)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La vraye definition</span>;” — “the true definition.” </p></div></div>
