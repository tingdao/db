<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Uphold my steps. </em>If we take <em>God’s paths </em>for the precepts of his law, the sense will be evident, namely, that although David had spoken according to truth, in boasting of having, in the midst of the most grievous temptations which assailed him, constantly practiced righteousness with a pure heart, yet, conscious of his own weakness, he commits himself to God to be governed by him, and prays for grace to enable him to persevere. His language is as if he had said, Since hitherto, under thy guidance, I have proceeded onward in the right path, I beseech thee, in like manner, to keep my steps from sliding with respect to the time to come. And certainly the more any one excels in grace, <span class="cite-ref">(356)</span> the more ought he to be afraid of falling; for it is the usual policy of Satan to endeavor, even from the virtue and strength which God has given us, <span class="cite-ref">(357)</span> to produce in us carnal confidence which may induce carelessness. I do not altogether reject this sense, but I think it more probable that David here beseeches God to bring his affairs to a prosperous issue, however dark the aspect of matters was at present. The import of his language is this, Lord, since thou seest that I walk in uprightness and sincerity of heart, govern thou me in such a manner as to make all men see that thou art my protector and guardian, and leave me not to be cast down at the will of my enemies. Thus, by <em>the paths of the Lord, </em>he will mean not the doctrine by which our life is regulated, but the power by which God upholds us, and the protection by which he preserves us. And he addresses God in this manner, not only because all events are in his hand, but because when he takes care of us all things in our lot go on prosperously. When he adds, <em>that the soles of my feet may not slide, </em>he refers to the many adverse events which threaten us every moment, and to the danger we are in of perishing, if not sustained by the hand of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(356)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et de faict, selon qu’un chacun a receu plus de graces</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em>“And certainly the more grace any one has received.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(357)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De la vertu et force que Dieu nous aura donnee</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
