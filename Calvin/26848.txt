<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Then the soldiers. </em>The other Evangelists also mention the <em>parting </em>of Christ’s <em>garments among the soldiers, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_27:35</span>; <span class="bvs">Mar_15:24</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_23:34</span>.) There <em>were four </em>soldiers who <em>parted </em>among themselves all his <em>garments, </em>except <em>the coat, </em>which, being <em>without seam </em>could not be divided, and therefore <em>they cast lots </em>on it. To fix our minds on the contemplation of the purpose of God, the Evangelists remind us that, in this occurrence also, there was a fulfillment of Scripture. It may be thought, however, that the passage, which they quote from <span class="bvs">Psa_22:19</span>, is inappropriately applied to the subject in hand; for, though David complains in it that he was exposed as a prey to his enemies, he makes use of the word <em>garments </em>to denote metaphorically all his property; as if he had said, in a single word, that “he had been stripped naked and bare by wicked men;” and, when the Evangelists disregard the figure, they depart from the natural meaning of the passage. But we ought to remember, in the first place, that the psalm ought not to be restricted to David, as is evident from many parts of it, and especially from a clause in which it is written, <em>I will proclaim thy name among the Gentiles, </em>(<span class="bvs">Psa_22:22</span>) which must be explained as referring to Christ. We need not wonder, therefore, if that which was faintly shadowed out in David is beheld in Christ with all that superior clearness which the truth ought to have, as compared with the figurative representation of it. </p><p>Let us also learn that. Christ was stripped of his <em>garments, </em>that he might clothe us with righteousness; that his naked body was exposed to the insults of men, that we may appear in glory before the judgment-seat of God. As to the allegorical meaning to which some men have tortured this passage, by making it mean, that heretics tear Scripture in pieces, it is too far-fetched; though I would not object to such a comparison as this, —that, as the <em>garments </em>of Christ were once divided by ungodly <em>soldiers, </em>so, in the present day, there are perverse men who, by foreign inventions, tear the whole of the Scripture, with which Christ is clothed, in order that he may be manifested to us. But the wickedness of the Papists, accompanied by shocking blasphemy against God, is intolerable. They tell us, that Scripture is torn to pieces by heretics, but that <em>the coat </em>— <em>that </em>is, the Church — remains entire; and thus they endeavor to prove that, without paying any attention to the authority of Scripture, the unity of faith consists in the mere title of the Church; as if the unity of the Church were itself founded on any thing else than the authority of Scripture. When, therefore, they separate faith from Scripture, so that it may continue to be attached to the Church alone, by such a divorce they not only strip Christ of his <em>garments, </em>but tear in pieces his body by shocking sacrilege. And though we should admit what they maintain, that <em>the coat without seam </em>is a figure of the Church, they will be very far from gaining their point: for it will still remain to be proved, that the Church is placed under their authority, of which they show no sign whatever. </p></div>
