<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>In whom ye also are builded together, </em>or <em>in whom also </em>Be Ye Builded <em>together. </em>The termination of the Greek verb<span class="lang el-gr">, συνοικοδομεῖσθε, </span> like that of the Latin, <em>cooedificamini, </em> does not enable us to determine whether it is in the imperative or indicative mood. The context will admit either, but I prefer the latter sense. It is, I think, an exhortation to the Ephesians to grow more and more in the faith of Christ, after having been once founded in it, and thus to form a part of that new temple of God, the building of which through the gospel was then in progress in every part of the world. </p><p><em>Through the Spirit. </em>This is again repeated for two reasons: first, to remind them that all human exertions are of no avail without the operation of the Spirit; and secondly, to point out the superiority of the spiritual building to all Jewish and outward services. </p></div>
