<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>For I hope, etc. </em>He refers to the reason why he had for a long time wished to come to them, and now intended to do so, â€” even that he might see them, enjoy an interview and an intercourse with them, and make himself known to them in his official character; for by the coming of the Apostles the gospel also came. </p><p>By saying, to <em>be brought on my way thither by you, </em>he intimates how much he <em>expected </em>from their kindness; and this, as we have already observed, is the best way for conciliating favor; for the more confidence any one hears is reposed in him, the stronger are the obligations under which he feels himself; inasmuch as we deem it base and discourteous to disappoint the good opinion formed of us. And by adding, <em>When I shall first be in part filled, etc.</em>, he bears witness to the benevolence of his mind towards them; and to convince them of this was very necessary for the interest of the gospel. </p></div>
