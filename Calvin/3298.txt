<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Thou shalt not go up and down</em>. The principle of the second clause is the same as that of the foregoing verse, for it is added to a general precept, whereby detraction is condemned: and much more ought we to be deterred from it, whilst we acknowledge that our tongue is thus armed cruelly to shed innocent blood. Some suppose that the word <span class="lang he-il">רכיל</span>, <em>racil</em>, is metaphorically taken from merchants, because the tale-bearer or whisperer <span class="cite-ref">(169)</span> is no less busy in hunting for false reports, which he may afterwards circulate, than the merchant is diligently bent on buying and selling. Others think that there is a change of the letter <span class="lang he-il">ג</span> into <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>; and that thus the word is derived from the <em>feet</em>; because calumniators are always wandering about to hunt for grounds of detraction; and therefore is always joined with a verb which signifies to walk. I do not think, however, that it is always used in the same sense; for when Ezekiel reproves the Israelites, because there were always men called <span class="lang he-il">רכיל</span>, <em>racil</em>, among them, to shed blood, <span class="cite-ref">(170)</span> I understand men of fraud, or fraudulent persons, who plot against the good to procure their destruction. ( <span class="bvs">Eze_22:9</span>.) Some also translate it spies. Meanwhile, I doubt not, but that Moses, in this passage, designates those vagabonds, who too eagerly run about hither and thither, and in their malignant inquisitiveness penetrate into everybody’s secrets, to bring quiet people into trouble. In short, we are taught that they are <em>accounted </em>false witnesses before God, whosoever by the virulence of their tongue bring their brethren into danger and inconvenience. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(169)</span> “Delator aut susurro.” — <em>Lat</em>. “The original properly signifies a <em>trader</em>, <em>a pedlar</em>, and is here applied to one who travels up and down dealing in slanders and detractions, as a merchant does in wares, possessing himself of the secrets of individuals and families, and then blazing them abroad, usually with a false colouring as to motives and a distortion of facts.” — Bush. “Some explain <span class="lang he-il">רכיל</span> as if <span class="lang he-il">רגיל</span>, (the <span class="lang he-il">ג</span> being changed into <span class="lang he-il">כ</span>,) from <span class="lang he-il">רגל</span>, <em>to run about</em>, <em>to explore</em>. ” — Fagius, from the Hebrew Commentators, in Poole’s Synopsis. “Non reperimus in S.
