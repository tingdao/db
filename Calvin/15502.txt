<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>Jehovah in Zion </em>It is proper that we should not forget the antithesis I formerly mentioned, namely, that God is great in Zion to destroy and annihilate all the enemies of his Church; and that, when the Psalmist goes on to say, <em>he is high above all nations, </em>his meaning is, not that he presides over them to promote their welfare, but to disconcert their counsels, to baffle their designs, and to subvert all their power. That which immediately follows about the <em>praising of God’s name, </em>refers not to the nations at large, but in my opinion to the faithful, from whom alone the prophet demands a tribute of gratitude. For although God compels his vanquished enemies to acknowledge him, yet as they do not cease from speaking against his glory, and blaspheming his holy name, it cannot be to them that the exhortation is addressed, <em>Praise the name of God, for it is holy; </em>but to the faithful, who, from their knowledge of God’s holy name, very cordially engage in the celebration of its praises. </p></div>
