<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And if ye walk</em>. Translators give various renderings of the word <span class="lang he-il">קרי</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(226)</span><em>keri</em>. The Chaldee takes it to mean <em>with hardness</em>, as if it were their purpose to contend against God. Jerome renders it <em>ex adverso mihi</em>, (in opposition to me;) but, since the word signifies an accidental occurrence, or contingency, this sense has seemed to me much the most appropriate. To “walk at adventures” ( <em>fortuito</em>) with God, therefore, is equivalent to passing by His judgments with their eyes shut; and even so to stupify themselves as to ascribe their adversities to fortune, and thus not to be humbled beneath His mighty hand; for hence arises unconquerable obstinacy, when the sinner imagines that whatever he suffers happens by chance. Therefore Jeremiah inveighs against the Jews in a severe reproof, because they supposed that evil and good did not proceed from the ordinance and decree of God, ( <span class="bvs">Lam_3:38</span>;) for hence is engendered brutal madness, so that wretched men rush with all their might to their own destruction. It will accord very well, then, that if men do not take heed to God’s judgments, but rush onwards like furious beasts, His meeting with them will be, as it were, fortuitous, when He shall smite them indiscriminately, from right to left, high and low, as we say in French <em>aller a tors et travers</em>. This, therefore, the sinner at length obtains by his stupid obstinacy, that, overwhelmed by his manifold punishments, he sees no end to his troubles. Meanwhile there is no doubt but that Moses rebukes the iron obstinacy of the people, as David declares, that with the gentle God will be gentle, but that He will be stubborn, as it were, with the perverse. ( <span class="bvs">Psa_18:25</span>.) He finally points out the source of obstinacy, when the sinner is intoxicated by his stupidity into contempt for God, whilst he turns away from himself, as much as possible, the sense of His wrath. Let us learn, then, to withdraw our thoughts from vague speculations to the consideration of God’s hand in all the punishments which He inflicts; because hence will arise acknowledgment of our guilt, which may lead to repentance. Else that will occur which Isaiah seems to have taken from this passage, that God’s <em>anger </em>will never be <em>turned away</em>; but that, when we think that we are acquitted, <em>His hand </em>will be <em>stretched out still</em>. ( <span class="bvs">Isa_9:12</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(226)</span> “Fortuito.” — <em>Lat</em>.
