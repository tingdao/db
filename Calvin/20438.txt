<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet charges the people with another crime, that neglecting God, and even despising his favor, they had always attached themselves to vain and false hopes. And this was a sacrilege not to be endured, because they thus robbed God of his rights: and what does he demand more than that we should depend on him, and that our minds should acquiesce in him alone? When, therefore, salvation is expected from others rather than from God alone, he is, in a manner, reduced to nothing. The Prophet, then, accuses the Jews of this great, sacrilege, that they never betook themselves to God, nor had any hope in him, but on the contrary wandered here and there for help. </p><p><em>As yet for us, </em>he says, that, is, while we were yet standing. <span class="cite-ref">(217)</span> And this circumstance deserves to be noticed; for after the Jews had been overthrown, they at length began to know how they had been previously deceived, when they placed confidence in the Egyptians. Prosperity inebriates men, so that they take delight ill their own vanities: and while we seem to ourselves to stand, or while we remain alive, God is disregarded, and we seek help here and there, and think our safety beyond all danger. The Prophet then says, that the Jews had been inebriated with false confidence, so that they disregarded God, and in the meantime fled to the Egyptians. <em>When</em>, he says, <em>we were standing, our eyes failed, etc</em>. We have before seen what this phrase means: the eyes are said to fail, when with unwearied perseverance we pursue a hope to the last, as it is said in the Psalms, </p><p>“Our eyes have failed for the living God,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_69:3</span>;) </p><p>that is, We have persevered, and though many trials may have wearied us, yet we have been constant in our hope in God. So now the Prophet says, that the eyes of the people had failed; but he adds, for a vain help, or a help of vanity, by which term he designates the Egyptians: and there is an implied contrast between empty and fallacious help and the help of God, which the people rejected when they preferred the Egyptians. <em>Our eyes</em>, he says, <em>failed</em>, that is, we were unwearied in hoping vainly, for we always thought that the Egyptians would be a sufficient, defense to us. This is one thing. </p><p>He afterwards adds<em>, In our looking out, we looked out to a nation which could not save us. </em>He. repeats the same thing in other words. Some consider a relative to be understood, “In our expectation with which we have expected,” etc.; but it seems not necessary. I, then, so connect the words of the Prophet, that the meaning is, that the Jews always turned their eyes to Egypt, as long as they stood as a state and kingdom and thus they willfully deceived themselves, because they took delight in their own vanity. The other clause which follows has the same meaning, <em>In our expectation we expected a nation, </em>etc.; and this clause is added as an explanation; for the Prophet explains how their eyes failed for a vain hope, or for a vain help, even because the people did not look to God, but only to the Egyptians. </p><p>Now the words, to look out and looking out, are not unsuitable, for they refer to those vain imaginations to which the unbelieving give heed; for God called them, but turning away from him they transferred their hope to the Egyptians. It was, then, their own looking out or speculation, when, through a foolish conceit, they imagined that safety would be secured to them by the Egyptians. </p><p>He says that they were a<em>nation which could not save; </em>and there is no doubt but that the Prophet here puts them in mind of the many warnings which had not been received by the Jews, for God had tried to call them back from that ruinous confidence, but without any success; for we know how much the Prophets labored in this respect, but they were never believed until at length experience proved how vain was the help of Egypt, as God had testified by his servants. </p><p><strong>(217)</strong> The true reading is no doubt <span class="lang he-il">עדינו</span>; and <em>Blayney </em>thinks that there is a <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> wanting before the next verb, as it is in other in other instances; <span class="bvs">1Kg_1:14</span>; <span class="bvs">Job_1:16</span>. It is supplied in the <em>Sept., Syr., </em>and <em>Vulg. </em></p><p>Yet we <em>were, </em>and fail did our eyes <LineBreak />As to our assistance; <LineBreak />In vain by looking out did we look out <LineBreak />To a nation that could not save. </p><p>The <em>Syr</em>. connect “in vain,” more properly, with the third line. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
