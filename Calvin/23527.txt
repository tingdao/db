<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>By thy words thou shalt be justified </em>This was a common proverb, which he applied to the present subject; for I have no doubt that this was a saying which the people had frequently in their mouths, that “every man is condemned or acquitted by his own acknowledgment.” But Christ turns it to a meaning somewhat different, that a wicked speech, being the indication of concealed malice, is enough to condemn a man. The attempt which the Papists make to torture this passage, so as to set aside the righteousness of faith, is childish. A man is <em>justified by his words, </em>not because his <em>speech </em>is the ground of his justification, (for we obtain by faith the favor of God, so that he reckons us to be righteous persons;) but because pure <em>speech </em><span class="cite-ref">(142)</span> absolves us in such a manner, that we are not condemned as wicked persons by our tongue. Is it not absurd to infer from this, that men deserve a single drop of righteousness in the sight of God? On the contrary, this passage upholds our doctrine; for, although Christ does not here treat of the ground of our justification, yet the contrast between the two words points out the meaning of the word <em>justify. </em>The Papists reckon it absurd in us to say, that a man is justified by faith, because they explain the word <em>justified </em>to mean, that he becomes, and is, actually righteous; while we understand it to mean, that he is accounted righteous, and is <em>acquitted </em>before the tribunal of God, as is evident from numerous passages of Scripture. And is not the same thing confirmed by Christ, when he draws a contrast between <em>justified </em>and <em>condemned? </em></p><p><strong>(142)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La parole pure, droite, et honneste</span>;” — “pure, upright, and becoming speech.” </p></div>
