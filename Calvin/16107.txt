<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>The waters had then overwhelmed us. </em>He embellishes by an elegant metaphor the preceding sentiment, comparing the dreadful impetuosity of the enemies of the Jews to an inundation, which swallows up whatever it meets with in its overflowing course. And he continues to preserve the character of a man affrighted. He names <em>the waters, </em>next <em>the torrent, </em>thirdly, <em>the proud </em>or <em>impetuous waters. </em>He says, <em>over us, </em>and <em>over our soul, </em>as if, by presenting the thing to the eye, he intended to strike terror into the people. And certainly this impassioned language ought to have all the effect of a graphic representation, that the faithful might the better feel from what a profound gulf they had been rescued by the hand of God. He only truly attributes his deliverance to God, who acknowledges himself to have been lost before he was delivered. The adverb <em>them </em>is here either demonstrative, as if the Psalmist had pointed to the thing with the finger, or it is taken for <em>long ago. </em>The former signification is, however, more suitable to the present passage. </p></div>
