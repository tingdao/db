<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>There was a feast of the Jews. </em>Though the Evangelist does not expressly state what<em>feast </em>this was, yet the probable conjecture is that he means Pentecost, at least if what is here related took place immediately after that Christ came into Galilee. For immediately after the Passover he set out from Jerusalem, and, as he was passing through Samaria, he reckoned <em>four months to the harvest</em>; having entered Galilee he cured the courtierâ€™s son. The Evangelist adds that the <em>feast </em>came afterwards; and, therefore, the order of time leads us to conclude that we ought to understand it to be Pentecost; though I do not dispute about that matter. Now Christ <em>came to Jerusalem to the feast</em>, partly because at that time, on account of the great multitude of people who were assembled, he had the opportunity of publishing his doctrine more extensively, and partly because it was necessary that he should be subject to the Law, that he might redeem us from the bondage of the Law, as we have already explained on former occasions. </p></div>
