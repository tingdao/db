<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Therefore by the works of the law, etc. </em>It is a matter of doubt, even among the learned, what the works of the law mean. Some extend them to the observance of the whole law, while others confine them to the ceremonies alone. The addition of the word <em>law </em>induced [<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Origen </span>], and [<span class="bvs">Jerome </span>] to assent to the latter opinion; <span class="cite-ref">(106)</span> for they thought that there is a peculiar intimation in this appendage, that the expression should not be understood as including all works. But this difficulty may be very easily removed: for seeing works are so far just before God as we seek by them to render to him worship and obedience, in order expressly to take away the power of justifying from all works, he has mentioned those, if there be any, which can possibly justify; for the law hath promises, without which there would be no value in our works before God. You hence see the reason why Paul expressly mentioned the works of the law; for it is by the law that a reward is apportioned to works. Nor was this unknown to the schoolmen, who held it as an approved and common maxim, that works have no intrinsic worthiness, but become meritorious by covenant. And though they were mistaken, inasmuch as they saw not that works are ever polluted with vices, which deprive them of any merit, yet this principle is still true, that the reward for works depends on the free promise of the law. Wisely then and rightly does Paul speak here; for he speaks not of mere works, but distinctly and expressly refers to the keeping of the law, the subject which he is discussing. <span class="cite-ref">(107)</span></p><p>As to those things which have been adduced by learned men in defense of this opinion, they are weaker than they might have been. They think that by mentioning circumcision, an example is propounded, which belonged to ceremonies only: but why Paul mentioned circumcision, we have already explained; for none swell more with confidence in works than hypocrites, and we know that they glory only in external masks; and then circumcision, according to their view, was a sort of initiation into the righteousness of the law; and hence it seemed to them a work of primary excellence, and indeed the basis as it were of the righteousness of works. — They also allege what is said in the Epistle to the Galatians, where Paul handles the same subject, and refers to ceremonies only; but that also is not sufficiently strong to support what they wish to defend. It is certain that Paul had a controversy with those who inspired the people with a false confidence in ceremonies; that he might cut of this confidence, he did not confine himself to ceremonies, nor did he speak specifically of what value they were; but he included the whole law, as it is evident from those passages which are derived from that source. Such also was the character of the disputation held at Jerusalem by the disciples. </p><p>But we contend, not without reason, that Paul speaks here of the whole law; for we are abundantly supported by the thread of reasoning which he has hitherto followed and continues to follow, and there are many other passages which will not allow us to think otherwise. It is therefore a truth, which deserves to be remembered as the first in importance, — that by keeping the law no one can attain righteousness. He had before assigned the reason, and he will repeat it presently again, and that is, that all, being to a man guilty of transgression, are condemned for unrighteousness by the law. And these two things — to be justified by works — and to be guilty of transgressions, (as we shall show more at large as we proceed,) are wholly inconsistent the one with the other. — The word <em>flesh, </em>without some particular specification, signifies men; <span class="cite-ref">(108)</span> though it seems to convey a meaning somewhat more general, as it is more expressive to say, “All mortals,” than to say, “All men,” as you may see in <em>Gallius. </em></p><p><em>For by the law, etc. </em>He reasons from what is of an opposite character, — that righteousness is not brought to us by the law, because it convinces us of sin and condemns us; for life and death proceed not from the same fountain. And as he reasons from the contrary effect of the law, that it cannot confer righteousness on us, let us know, that the argument does not otherwise hold good, except we hold this as an inseparable and unvarying circumstance, — that by showing to man his sin, it cuts off the hope of salvation. It is indeed by itself, as it teaches us what righteousness is, the way to salvation: but our depravity and corruption prevent it from being in this respect of any advantage to us. It is also necessary in the second place to add this, — that whosoever is found to be a sinner, is deprived of righteousness; for to devise with the sophisters a half kind of righteousness, so that works in part justify, is frivolous: but nothing is in this respect gained, on account of man’s corruption. </p><p><strong>(106)</strong> The original is “ut in priorem opinionem concederent :” but the context shows clearly that “priorem “ is a misprint for “posteriorem. In addition to the authors mentioned here may be added [<span class="bvs">Ambrose </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Theodoret </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Pelagius </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>] <em>, </em>and [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] And yet, notwithstanding all those authorities, the opinion referred to is wholly inconsistent with the reasoning of the Apostle here and throughout the whole Epistle. It has indeed been given up as untenable by modern authors of the same school, such as [<span class="bvs">Locke </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Whitby </span>] <em>, </em>and [<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] </p><p>To disprove this notion it is sufficient to notice the sins which the Apostle had referred to; they are not those against the ceremonial but the moral law, and it is because the moral law is transgressed that it cannot justify. </p><p>“If there be any law which man has perfectly kept, he may doubtless be justified by it; and surely no man can be justified by a law which condemns him for breaking it. But there is no law of God which any man has kept; therefore no law by the deeds of which a man can be justified. The Gentile broke the law of his reason and conscience; the Jew broke the moral law; and even the attempt to justify himself by observing the ceremonial law, contradicted the very nature and intent of it.” — [<span class="bvs">Scott </span>] </p><p><strong>(107)</strong> The argument and the reasoning of the Apostle seem to require that<span class="lang el-gr">ἐξ ἔργων νόμου </span> should be rendered here literally, “by works of law,” without the article, as the word “law” seems here, according to the drift of the argument, to mean law in general, both natural and revealed; and<span class="lang el-gr">διὰ νόμου </span> in the next clause must be regarded as having the same meaning; the law of nature as well as the written law, though not to the same extent, makes sin known. This is the view taken by [<span class="bvs">Pareus </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] <em>, </em>and [<span class="bvs">Haldane </span>]. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(108)</strong> The expression is<span class="lang el-gr">ὀυ πᾶσα σὰρξ </span> — not all, that is, not any flesh, etc.; the word<span class="lang el-gr">πᾶσα, </span> like <span class="lang he-il">כל</span> in Hebrew, is used here in the sense of “any.” The sentence bears a resemblance to what is contained in <span class="bvs">Psa_143:2</span>, “for justified before thee shall not all living,” or, not any one living, <span class="lang he-il">לא כל חי</span>. The sentence here is literally, “Hence by works of law shall not be justified any flesh before Him.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
