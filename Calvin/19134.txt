He anticipates, no doubt, all objections, as though he had said, “I know what you will say, — that this place is sacred to God, that his name is invoked here, and that sacrifices are here offered: all these things, he says, are alleged to no purpose, for in Shiloh also was his name invoked, and he dwelt there. Though then ye foolishly trust in this place, it shall not yet escape that judgment which happened to the former place.” He adds, <em>which I gave to you and to your fathers </em>Be it so; for this is to be considered as a concession; and at the same time objections are anticipated, in order that the Jews might understand that it availed them nothing, that God had chosen to build his sanctuary on Mount Sion; for the object was to promote religion. But as the place was converted to a wholly different purpose, and as God’s name was there shamefully profaned, he says, “Though I gave this place to you and your fathers, yet nothing better shall be its fate than the fate of Shiloh.” <span class="cite-ref">(198)</span> It follows — </p><p><strong>(198)</strong> The literal rendering of the two verses is as follows:- </p><p><strong>13.</strong>And now, as ye have done all these doings, saith Jehovah, And <em>as </em>I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, And ye have not hearkened, And I have called you, and ye have not answered; </p><p><strong>14.</strong>I will also do to the house, On which my name is called, In which ye trust, and to the place, Which I gave to you and to your fathers, According to what I did to Shiloh: </p><p>“The house” was the Temple, “the place” was the city: both are threatened with destruction. Then he says in the next verse, “And I will cast you from my presence.” The Temple and the city were to be destroyed like Shiloh; and <em>they </em>(“you”) were to be dealt with as their brethren, the ten tribes, who had been driven into exile. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
