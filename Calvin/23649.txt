<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_15:15</span><strong>.</strong><em>And Peter answering said. </em>As the disciples betray excessive ignorance, Christ justly reproves and upbraids them for being <em>still void of understanding, </em>and yet does not fail to act as their teacher. What Matthew ascribes in a peculiar manner to Peter is related by Mark, in the same sense, as a question put by them all; and this is evident from Christ’s reply, in which he reproves the ignorance, not of Peter only, but of all of them alike. The general meaning is, that men are not polluted by food, but that they have within themselves the pollution of sins, which afterwards shows itself in the outward actions. Is it objected that intemperance in eating is defilement? The solution is easy. Christ speaks only of the proper and lawful use of those things which God has put in our power. To eat and drink are things in their own nature free and indifferent: if any corruption be added, it proceeds from the man himself, and therefore must be regarded not as external, but internal. <span class="cite-ref">(410)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(410)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et pourtant le vice est tousiours interieur, et ne vient point d’ailleurs</span>;” — “and therefore sin is always internal, and does not come from without.” </p></div></div>
