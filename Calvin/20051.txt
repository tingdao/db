<div class="comment-content"><p>For it immediately follows, <em>Why, </em>or how, <em>have I seen them broken? </em>Here the Prophet, on the other hand, disregards all the things which he before enumerated in such high terms, for he spoke, as it were, according to the common judgment of men. And, as I have said, he undertook the person of a herald, as though Pharaoh himself had commanded the Egyptians immediately to take up arms. This then was apparently very formidable. But the Prophet now speaks as though standing on an eminence, and says, How or what is this? for <span class="lang he-il">מדוע</span>, m<em>eduo, </em>is a particle of wonder, How! He then passes over from the common opinion of the flesh to the prophetic Spirit, as though he had said, “Were any one to judge of the Egyptians by their external splen-dour, he would say that they would be victorious over their enemies; but were any one to ascend higher and to form a judgment, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit, he would see that all this is frail and evanescent.” </p><p>But the question, <em>How? </em>is to be taken as emphatical; for it could have been hardly believed that an army so well equipped could have become a prey to the Babylonians, and that it was hastening to its own ruin. As then this seemed incredible to any one attending to the subject, the Prophet asks, How have I seen them? He however says that he <em>saw </em>them, even because God had set him, as we have said, as it were on a watch-tower. This, however, may be applied to the body as well as to the mind. <em>I saw them turned backward:, </em>when yet they were rushing forward, as he says afterwards, like a flood. <em>Their valiant </em>men, he says, <em>have been smitten, and by flight they have fled. </em>He means, in short, that there would not be so much courage in the Egyptians as to withstand the onset of their enemies, because they would be broken down by the hidden power of God. He also adds, that their flight would be accompanied with so much dread, that they would not dare to look behind, so that their danger would increase their haste. </p><p>He at length adds in God’s name, <em>Terror on every side, says Jehovah </em>Here he changes the person the third time, for he declares as from God’s mouth that there would be <em>terror on every side; </em>and thus it is an answer to the question, How, or why? even because God, he says, executes his judgment on them. Whenever, therefore, we see that nothing is wanting to our enemies for victory even over the Church of God, let what the Prophet says here be remembered by us, that there is no reason why we should despond, though we may be filled with wonder and amazement; for God will so work as to break down, without the hand of man, those who shake the whole world with terror. It afterwards follows, — </p></div>
