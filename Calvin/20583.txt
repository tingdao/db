<div class="comment-content"><p>If we read <span class="lang he-il">אחת</span><em>, acheth, </em>or <span class="lang he-il">אחר</span>, <em>acher, </em>the sense seems to me the same, <em>an evil, another evil is come: </em>that is, one evil is come from another, or one evil is come and an evil: that is, when one evil is come another will soon follow. Some explain it in way which seems to me harsh and unsatisfactory: one evil is come; this is so severe that at its first impulse it suffices for complete slaughter, so subtilely do they explain it. But it seems to me that the sense of the Prophet flows best thus, <em>one evil shall come upon another </em>— that is, there will be no cessation in God’s heaping evils upon evils until the very name of the whole people shall become extinct. And this appears to me to be said, that the Israelites should not after their manner suppose themselves safe, if God gives them a short respite. For when a slight intermission happens, the impious erect their crests, and keep up their spirits, and think that God is at peace with them. Since, therefore, any intermission is taken by hypocrites, as if they had made their peace with God, therefore the Prophet says, <em>one evil shall come upon another </em>It follow — </p></div>
