<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Teach me thy way, O Jehovah! </em>Many think that David here requests that God would guide him by his Spirit, lest he should surpass his enemies in acting violently and wickedly. This doctrine is, no doubt, very useful, but it does not seem to agree with the scope of the passage. It is a simpler interpretation, in my opinion, to consider that David desires, in order to escape the snares and violence of his enemies, that God would extend to him his hand, and safely conduct him, so as to give a happy issue to his affairs. He sets <em>the right path </em>in opposition to the difficulties and impediments which are in places which are rough, and of difficult access, to overcome which he was unequal, unless God undertook the office of a guide to lead him. But he who thus desires to commit himself to the safeguard and protection of God, <span class="cite-ref">(588)</span> must first renounce crafty and wicked devices. We must not expect that God, who promises to grant a happy issue only to the single in heart, and those who trust in his faithfulness, will bless crooked and wicked counsels. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(588)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En la sauvegarde et protection de Dieu</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
