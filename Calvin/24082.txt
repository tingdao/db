<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_26:27</span><strong>.</strong><em>Drink you all of it. </em>As it was the design of Christ to keep our faith wholly fixed on himself, that we may not seek any thing apart from him, he employed two symbols to show that our life is shut up in him. This body needs to be nourished and supported by meat and drink. Christ, in order to show that he alone is able to discharge perfectly all that is necessary for salvation, says that he supplies the place of meat and drink; by which he gives an astonishing display of his condescension, in thus letting himself down to the feeble capacity of our flesh for the purpose of invigorating our faith. So much the more detestable is the insolence and sacrilege of the Pope, who has not scrupled to break asunder this sacred tie. We learn that the Son of God employed two symbols together, to testify the fullness of life which he bestows on his followers. What right had a mortal man to separate those things which God had joined together? </p><p>But it would even appear that the express reason why our Lord commanded <em>all to drink of the cup </em>was in order to prevent this sacrilege from entering into the Church. As to the <em>bread, </em>we read that he simply said, <em>Take, eat. </em>Why does he expressly command them <em>all to drink, </em>and why does Mark explicitly say that <em>they all drank of it, </em>if it were not to guard believers against this wicked novelty? And yet this severe prohibition has not deterred the Pope from venturing to change and violate a law established by the Lord; for he has withheld all the people from using <em>the cup. </em>And to prove that his rage has reason on its side, he alleges that one of the kinds is sufficient, because <em>the flesh </em>includes the blood <em>by concomitancy. </em><span class="cite-ref">(196)</span> On the same pretext they would be at liberty to set aside the whole of the sacrament, because Christ might equally well make us partakers of himself without any external aid. But those childish cavils yield no support to their impiety; for nothing can be more absurd than that believers should, of their own accord, part with the aids which the Lord has given, or allow themselves to be deprived of them; and, therefore, nothing can be more intolerable than this wicked mangling of the mystery. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(196)</span> “<em class="lang fr-fr">Per concomitaniam</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, comme disent ses supposts; c’est à dire, pource que l’un ne peut estre sans l’autre</span>;” — “<em>By concomitancy, </em>as its partisans talk; that is, because the one cannot exist without the other.” </p></div></div>
