<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>45.</strong><em>Why should I be deprived of you both in one day </em>? Why does Rebekah fear a double privation? for there was no danger that Jacob, endued with a disposition so mild and placid, should rise up against his brother. We see, therefore, that Rebekah concluded that God would be the avenger of the iniquitous murder. Moreover, although God, for a time, might seem to overlook the deed, and to suspend his judgment, it would yet be necessary for him to withdraw from the parricide. Therefore, by this law of nature, Rebekah declares that she should be entirely bereaved; because she would be compelled to dread and to detest him who survived. But if Rebekah anticipated in her mind what the judgment of God would be, and devoted the murderer to destruction, because she was persuaded that wickedness so great would not be unpunished; much less ought we to close our eyes against the manifest chastisements of God. <span class="cite-ref">(52)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(52)</span> The French is more diffuse: “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tant plus nous faut — il appercevoir les fleaux de Dieu qui sont manifestes, et ne faut point ciller les yeux en ne faisant semblant de les voir</span>.” So much the more ought we to perceive the scourges of God, which are manifest; and we ought not to wink as pretending not to see them. — <em>Fr</em>. <em>Tr</em>. </p></div></div>
