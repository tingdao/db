<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old </em><span class="cite-ref">(450)</span> It is remarkable that Moses, who relates the death of Sarah in a single word, uses so many in describing her burial: but we shall soon see that the latter record is not superfluous. Why he so briefly alludes to her death, I know not, except that he leaves more to be reflected upon by his readers than he expresses. The holy fathers saw that they in common with reprobates, were subject to death. Nevertheless, they were not deterred, While painfully leading a life full of suffering, from advancing with intrepidity towards the goal. Whence it follows, that they, being animated by the hope of a better life, did not give way to fatigue. Moses says that Sarah lived a hundred and twenty-seven years, and since he repeats the word <em>years </em>after each of the numbers, the Jews feign that this was done because she had been as beautiful in her hundredth, as in her twentieth year, and as modest in the flower of her age, as when she was seven years old. This is their custom; while they wish to prove themselves skillful in doing honor to their nations they invent frivolous trifles, which betray a shameful ignorance: as, for instance, in this place, who would not say that they were entirely ignorant of their own languages in which this kind of repetition is most usual? The discussion of others also, on the word <span class="lang he-il">חים</span>, (<em>lives</em>,) is without solidity. The reason why the Hebrews use the word <em>lives </em>in the plural number, for <em>life</em>, cannot be better explained, as it appears to me, than the reason why the Latins express some things which are singular in plural forms. <span class="cite-ref">(451)</span> I know that the life of men is manifold, because, beyond merely vegetative life, and beyond the sense which they have in common with brute animals, they are also endued with mind and intelligence. This reasoning, therefore, is plausible without being solid. There is more color of truth in the opinion of those who think that the various events of human life are signified; which life, since it has nothing stable, but is agitated by perpetual vicissitudes, is rightly divided into many lives. I am, however, contented to refer simply to the idiom of the language; the reason of which is not always to be curiously investigated. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(450)</span> Literally, “The lives of Sarah were a hundred years, and twenty years, and seven years.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(451)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Quam quod Latini quadrigas dicant non quadrigam.” </p></div></div>
