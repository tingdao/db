<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Jesus saith to them again, Peace be to you. </em>This second salutation appears to me to have no other object than that the Lord should receive such a degree of attention as was due to the greatness and importance of the subjects on which he was about to speak. </p><p><em>As the Father hath sent me. </em>By these words, Christ, as it were, instals them in the <em>office </em>to which he had previously appointed them. True, they had been already sent throughout Judea, but only as heralds, to issue a command that the supreme Teacher should be heard, and not as Apostles, to execute a perpetual office of teaching. But now the Lord ordains them to be his ambassadors, to establish his kingdom in the world. Let it therefore be held by us as an ascertained truth, that the Apostles were now, for the first time, appointed to be ordinary ministers of the Gospel. </p><p>His words amount to a declaration, that hitherto he has discharged the <em>office </em>of a Teacher, and that, having finished his course, he now confers on them the same office; for he means that the Father appointed him to be a <em>Teacher </em>on this condition, that he should be employed, for a time, in pointing out the way to others, and should, afterwards, put those persons in his room to supply his absence, for this reason Paul says that <em>he gave some, apostles; some, evangelists; some, pastors, </em>to govern the Church till the end of the world, (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:11</span>.) Christ therefore testifies, first, that, though he held a temporary office of teaching, still the preaching of the Gospel is not for a short time, but will be perpetual. Again, that his doctrine may not have less authority in the mouth of the Apostles, he bids them succeed to that office which he has <em>received from his Father, </em>places<em>them </em>in his room, and bestows on them the same authority; and it was proper that their ministry should be ratified in this manner, for they were unknown persons and of mean condition. Moreover, though they had the highest splendor and dignity, yet we know that all that belongs to men does not approach to the excellence of faith. </p><p>It is not without reason, therefore, that Christ communicates to his Apostles the authority which he <em>received from the Father, </em>that thus he may declare that the preaching of the Gospel was committed to him, nut by human authority, but by the command of God. But he does not substitute them in his room, in such a manner as to resign to them the highest authority as a teacher, which the Father intended to be vested in him alone. He therefore continues, and will eternally continue to be, the only Teacher of the Church; but there is only this difference, that he spoke with his mouth so long as he dwelt on earth, but now speaks by the Apostles. The succession or substitution, <span class="cite-ref">(205)</span> therefore, is of such a nature that it takes nothing from Christ, but his authority remains full and entire, and his honor unimpaired; for that decree by which we are enjoined to hear him, and not others, cannot be set aside: </p><p>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_17:5</span>.) </p><p>In short, Christ intended here to adorn the doctrine of the Gospel and not men. </p><p>It ought likewise to be observed, that the only subject which is handled in this passage is the preaching of the Gospel; for Christ does not send his Apostles to atone for sins, and to procure justification, <em>as he was sent by the Father. </em>Accordingly, he makes no allusion in this passage to anything which is peculiar to himself, but only appoints ministers and pastors to govern the Church; and on this condition, that he alone keeps possession of the whole power, while they claim nothing for themselves but the ministry. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(205)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La succession ou subrogation</span>.” </p></div></div>
