<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>For ye are dead. </em>No one can rise again with Christ, if he has not first died with him. Hence he draws an argument from <em>rising again </em>to <em>dying</em>, as from a consequent to an antecedent, <span class="cite-ref">(434)</span> meaning that we must be dead to the world that we may live to Christ. Why has he taught, that we must <em>seek those things that are above </em>? It is because the life of the pious is <em>above</em>. Why does he now teach, that the things which are on earth are to be left off? Because they are dead to the world. “Death goes before that resurrection, of which I have spoken. Hence both of them must be seen in you.” </p><p>It is worthy of observation, that our <em>life </em>is said to be <em>hid</em>, that we may not murmur or complain if our life, being buried under the ignominy of the cross, and under various distresses, differs nothing from death, but may patiently wait for the day of revelation. And in order that our waiting may not be painful, let us observe those expressions, <em>in God</em>, and <em>with Christ</em>, which intimate that our life is out of danger, although it does not appear. For, in the <em>first </em>place, God is faithful, and therefore will not deny what has been <em>committed </em>to him, (<span class="bvs">2Ti_1:12</span>,) nor deceive in the guardianship which he has undertaken; and, <em>secondly</em>, the fellowship of Christ brings still greater security. For what is to be more desired by us than this — that our life remain with the very fountain of life. Hence there is no reason why we should be alarmed if, on looking around on every side, we nowhere see life. For we are </p><p>saved by hope. But those things which are already seen with our eyes are not hoped for. (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:24</span>.) </p><p>Nor does he teach that our life is hid merely in the opinion of the world, but even as to our own view, because this is the true and necessary trial of our hope, that being encompassed, as it were, with death, we may seek life somewhere else than in the world. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(434)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire de ce qui suit a ce qui va deuant</span>;” — “That is to say, from what follows to what comes before.” </p></div></div>
