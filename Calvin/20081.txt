<div class="comment-content"><p>Some take <em>it</em>, <span class="lang he-il">×”</span>, <em>he</em>, as meaning the land itself; but as it immediately follows, <em>against Ashkelon </em>and <em>against the seashore</em>, it is better to explain it as above. </p><p>By the <em>sea-shore </em>some understand Joppa; but it is probable that the Prophet includes the whole coast, and that he thus still speaks of Tyre, and Sidon, and Gaza, though he names Ashkelon, which was a little distant from the sea. When, therefor, God commanded his sword against Ashkelon and all the cities which were by the sea-shore, the execution of his judgement could not be prevented in that region. He further adds<em>, he hath commanded it; </em>but it is in a solemn manner, and hence I have rendered the words, <em>he hath called it to witness</em>, or protested it. He then intimates that God had not simply given his sword a command to commit slaughters through the whole land, but bound his sword, as it were, by solemn protest; as though he had said, that this decree could not be revoked, because Godwill not only command his sword to execute his vengeance, but will also give it a solemn command, and bind it, as it were, by an oath, never to cease from its work until the whole people, and all the cities, and the whole land, should be destroyed together. </p></div>
