But the Prophet brought the Rechabites into an honorable place, even <em>into the chamber of the sons of Hanan </em>And he afterwards says, that he was <em>the son of Igdaliah, a man of God </em>Doubtless such was the reverence in which this man was held, that no one dared to call into question what had been done there.
