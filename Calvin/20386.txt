<div class="comment-content"><p>It is certain that there will be no patience, except there be hope, as it has already appeared. As, then, patience cherishes hope, so hope is the foundation of patience; and hence consolation is, according to Paul, connected with patience. (<span class="bvs">Rom_15:4</span>.) And this is the doctrine which the Prophet now handles, — that the faithful bear the yoke with meek and calm minds, because they believe that God will at length be propitious to them: hence also arises patience; for the faithful are persuaded that all adversities are temporary, and that there will be a happy end, because God will at length be reconciled to them, though he gives them new evidences of his wrath. <span class="cite-ref">(189)</span> The rest to-morrow. </p><p><strong>(189)</strong> This verse is connected with <span class="bvs">Lam_3:25</span> : “Good is Jehovah to him who waits for him;” and the reason is given here, “For not reject perpetually (or, for ever) will the Lord.” “For,” as assigning a reason, is here repeated three times, in this verse and in the two following verses; and they seem all to be reasons given for the truth contained in <span class="bvs">Lam_3:25</span>, </p><p>  </p><p><strong>31.</strong>For not reject perpetually <LineBreak />Will the Lord: </p><p><strong>32.</strong>For though he afflicts, yet he will shew compassion <LineBreak />According to the multitude of his mercies: </p><p><strong>33.</strong>For he does not depress from his heart, <LineBreak />Nor afflict the children of men. </p><p>All these particulars explain and elucidate the truth, that God is good. “From his heart,” does not mean “willingly,” but at his will, that is, arbitrarily, without reason, but when constrained by man’s wickedness. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
