<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>He maketh me to lie down in pastures of grass. </em>With respect to the words, it is in the Hebrew, <em>pastures, </em>or<em>fields of grass, </em>for <em>grassy and rich grounds. </em>Some, instead of translating the word <span class="lang he-il">נאות</span>,<em>neoth, </em>which we have rendered <em>pastures, </em>render it <em>shepherds’ cots </em>or <em>lodges. </em>If this translation is considered preferable, the meaning of the Psalmist will be, that sheep-cots were prepared in rich pasture grounds, under which he might be protected from the heat of the sun. If even in cold countries the immoderate heat which sometimes occurs is troublesome to a flock of sheep, how could they bear the heat of the summer in Judea, a warm region, without sheepfolds? The verb <span class="lang he-il">רבף</span>, <em>rabats, to lie down, </em>or <em>repose, </em>seems to have a reference to the same thing. David has used the phrase, <em>the quiet waters, </em>to express gently flowing waters; for rapid streams are inconvenient for sheep to drink in, and are also for the most part hurtful. In this verse, and in the verses following, he explains the last clause of the first verse, <em>I shall not want. </em>He relates how abundantly God had provided for all his necessities, and he does this without departing from the comparison which he employed at the commencement. The amount of what is stated is, that the heavenly Shepherd had omitted nothing which might contribute to make him live happily under his care. He, therefore, compares the great abundance of all things requisite for the purposes of the present life which he enjoyed, to meadows richly covered with grass, and to gently flowing streams of water; or he compares the benefit or advantage of such things to sheep-cots; for it would not have been enough to have been fed and satisfied in rich pasture, had there not also been provided waters to drink, and the shadow of the sheep-cot to cool and refresh him. </p></div>
