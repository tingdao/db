<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>I am not sent. </em>He informs the Apostles that his reason for refusing the woman of Canaan arises out of his desire to devote himself entirely to the Jews to whom alone he was appointed to be a minister of the grace of God. He argues from the call and the command of the Father, that he must not yield any assistance to strangers; not that the power of Christ was always confined within so narrow limits, but because present circumstances rendered it necessary that he should begin with the Jews, and at that time devote himself to them in a peculiar manner. For as I have said in expounding <span class="bvs">Mat_10:5</span><em>, the middle wall of partition </em>(<span class="bvs">Eph_2:14</span>) was not thrown down till after Christâ€™s resurrection that he might proclaim peace to the nations which were aliens from the kingdom of God: and therefore he prohibited the Apostles, at that time, from scattering anywhere but in Judea the first seed of doctrine. Justly therefore, does he affirm that, on this occasion, he was sent to the Jews only, till the Gentiles also followed in the proper order. </p><p><em>To the lost sheep of the house of Israel. </em>He bestows the designation of <em>sheep of the house of Israel </em>not on the elect only, but on all who were descended from the holy fathers; for the Lord had included all in the covenant, and was promised indiscriminately to all as a Redeemer, as he also revealed and offered himself to all without exception. It is worthy of observation, that he declares himself to have been <em>sent to LOST sheep, </em>as he assures us in another passage that he <em>came to save that which was lost</em>, (<span class="bvs">Mat_18:11</span>.) Now as we enjoy this favor, at the present day, in common with the Jews, we learn what our condition is till he appear as our Savior. </p></div>
