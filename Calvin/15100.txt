<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>I will call to remembrance my song in the night. </em>By <em>his song </em>he denotes the exercise of thanksgiving in which he had engaged during the time of his prosperity. <span class="cite-ref">(289)</span> There is no remedy better adapted for healing our sorrows, as I have just now observed, than this; but Satan often craftily suggests to our thoughts the benefits of God, that the very feeling of the want of them may inflict upon our minds a deeper wound. It is, therefore, highly probable, that the prophet was pierced with bitter pangs when he compared the joy experienced by him in time past with the calamities which he was presently suffering. He expressly mentions <em>the night; </em>because, when we are then alone by ourselves, and withdrawn from the society and presence of men, it engenders in the mind more cares and thoughts than are experienced during the day. What is added immediately after with respect to <em>communing with his own heart, </em>is to the same effect. Solitude has an influence in leading men to retire within their own minds, to examine themselves thoroughly, and to speak to themselves freely and in good earnest, when no created being is with them to impose a restraint by his presence. </p><p>The last clause of the verse, <em>And my spirit will search diligently, </em>admits of a twofold exposition. The word <span class="lang he-il">חפש</span>, <em>chaphas, </em>for <em>search diligently, </em><span class="cite-ref">(290)</span> being in the masculine gender, and the word <span class="lang he-il">רוה</span>, <em>ruach, </em>for <em>spirit, </em>being sometimes feminine, some commentators suppose that the name of <em>God </em>is to be understood, and explain the sentence as if the Psalmist had said, There is nothing, O Lord! so hidden in my heart into which thou hast not penetrated. And God is with the highest propriety said to search the spirit of the man whom he awakens from his indolence or torpor, and whom he examines by acute afflictions. Then all hiding — places and retreats, however obscure, are explored, and affections before unknown are brought into the light. As, however, the gender of the noun in the Hebrew language is ambiguous, others more freely translate, MY <em>spirit hath searched diligently. </em>This being the sense which is most generally embraced, and being, at the same time, the most natural, I readily adopt it. In that debate, of which the inspired writer makes mention, he searched for the causes on account of which he was so severely afflicted, and also into what. his calamities would ultimately issue. It is surely highly profitable to meditate on these subjects, and it is the design of God to stir us up to do this when any adversity presses upon us. There is nothing more perverse than the stupidity <span class="cite-ref">(291)</span> of those who harden themselves under the scourges of God. Only we must keep within due bounds, in order that we may not be swallowed up of over much sorrow, and that the unfathomable depth of the Divine judgments may not overwhelm us by our attempting to search them out thoroughly. The prophet’s meaning is, that when he sought for comfort in all directions, he could find none to assuage the bitterness of his grief. </p><p><strong>(289)</strong> “The times were indeed greatly altered; formerly his sleep had been prevented by the joyfulness of his feelings, which prompted the voice of thanksgiving during even the shades of night; now his sleep is taken away by the severity of his disease, and the anguish of his soul, which was augmented by the contrast with his past happiness.” — <em>Walford</em>. </p><p><strong>(290)</strong> “The verb <span class="lang he-il">חפש</span>, <em>chaphas</em>, signifies such an investigation as a man makes who is obliged to <em>strip himself </em>in order to do it. Or,<em>to lift up coverings</em>, to search fold by fold; or, in our phrase, <em>to leave no stone unturned </em>The Vulgate translates, <em>et scopebam spiritum meum </em> As <em>scopebam </em> is no pure Latin word, it may probably be taken from the Greek, <span class="lang el-gr">σκοπεω</span>,<em>scopeo</em>, ‘to look about, to consider attentively.’ It is, however, used by no author but St Jerome, and by him only here, and in <span class="bvs">Isa_14:23</span>, ‘And I will sweep it with the besom of destruction;’ ‘scopabo eam in scopa terens.’ Hence we see that he has formed a verb from the noun <em>scopae</em>; <em>a sweeping brush </em>or <em>besom</em>. ” —<em>Dr Adam Clarke </em></p><p><strong>(291)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La stupidite brutale</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “The brutish stupidity.” </p></div>
