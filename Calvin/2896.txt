<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>But if the sacrifice of his offering. </em>I have observed a little above that it is not a conditional but a simple vow which is here meant; because, if a person were under the obligation of a vow, <span class="cite-ref">(287)</span> his payment was an act of thanksgiving, and thus his sacrifice was comprised under the first head. But it would not be without absurdity that similar things should be distinguished as if they differed. But inasmuch as many made gratuitous vows, Moses combines this kind of sacrifice with the free-will-offering, as standing in the same rank. It has also been stated that the consecrated meats were not kept too long, lest they should become tainted or putrified, and thus religion should fall into contempt. Perhaps, too, vainglory was thus provided against; for if it had been allowable to eat the meats salted, many would have made ostentatious offerings without expense. God, therefore, imposed a restraint, that they might offer their sacrifices more sparingly and reverently. The penalty is added, that; the sacrifice would not be acceptable to God, but rather abominable; and hence all who ate of them would be guilty. Moreover, when Moses says that polluted sacrifices would not be “imputed,” we may infer that those which are duly offered come into account before God, so that He reckons them as things expended for Himself. Still we must not, imagine them to be merits which lay Him under obligation; but because He deigns to deal so liberally with us, that no duty which we pay Him is useless. </p><p><strong>(287)</strong><em>Lat., “ </em>damnatus esset.” Fr., “<span class="lang fr-fr">si quelqu’un avoit voue, et obtenu ce qu’il demandoit</span>;” if any one had vowed, and obtained what he asked. </p></div>
