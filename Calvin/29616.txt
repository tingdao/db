<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13</strong><em>But I would not have you ignorant</em>. It is not likely that the hope of a resurrection had been torn up among the Thessalonians by profane men, as had taken place at Corinth. For we see how he chastises the Corinthians with severity, but here he speaks of it as a thing that was not doubtful. It is possible, however, that this persuasion was not sufficiently fixed in their minds, and that they accordingly, in bewailing the dead, retained something of the old superstition. For the sum of the whole is this — that we must not bewail the dead beyond due bounds, inasmuch as we are all to be raised up again. For whence comes it, that the mourning of unbelievers has no end or measure, but because they have no hope of a resurrection? It becomes not us, therefore, who have been instructed as to a resurrection, to mourn otherwise than in moderation. He is to discourse afterwards as to the manner of the resurrection; and he is also on this account to say something as to <em>times; </em>but in this passage he meant simply to restrain excessive grief, which would never have had such an influence among them, if they had seriously considered the resurrection, and kept it in remembrance. </p><p>He does not, however, forbid us altogether to mourn, but requires moderation in our mourning, for he says, <em>that ye may not sorrow, as others who have no hope</em>. He forbids them to grieve in the manner of unbelievers, who give loose reins to their grief, because they look upon death as final destruction, and imagine that everything that is taken out of the world perishes. As, on the other hand, believers know that they quit the world, that they may be at last gathered into the kingdom of God, they have not the like occasion of grief. Hence the knowledge of a resurrection is the means of moderating grief. He speaks of the dead as <em>asleep</em>, agreeably to the common practice of Scripture — a term by which the bitterness of death is mitigated, for there is a great difference between <em>sleep </em>and <em>destruction </em><span class="cite-ref">(574)</span> It refers, however, not to the soul, but to the body, for the dead body lies in the tomb, as in a couch, until God raise up the man. Those, therefore, act a foolish part, who infer from this that souls sleep. <span class="cite-ref">(575)</span></p><p>We are now in possession of Paul’s meaning — that he lifts up the minds of believers to a consideration of the resurrection, lest they should indulge excessive grief on occasion of the death of their relatives, for it were unseemly that there should be no difference between them and unbelievers, who put no end or measure to their grief for this reason, that in death they recognize nothing but destruction. <span class="cite-ref">(576)</span> Those that abuse this testimony, so as to establish among Christians Stoical indifference, that is, an iron hardness, <span class="cite-ref">(577)</span> will find nothing of this nature in Paul’s words. As to their objecting that we must not indulge grief on occasion of the death of our relatives, lest we should resist God, this would apply in all adversities; but it is one thing to bridle our grief, that it may be made subject to God, and quite another thing to harden one’s self so as to be like stones, by casting away human feelings. Let, therefore, the grief of the pious be mixed with consolation, which may train them to patience. The hope of a blessed resurrection, which is the mother of patience, will effect this. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(574)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Entre dormir, et estre du tout reduit a neant</span>;” — “Between sleeping, and being altogether reduced to nothing.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(575)</span> See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 2, pp. 21, 22. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(576)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ruine et destruction</span>;” — “Ruin and destruction.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(577)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour introduire et establir entre les Chrestiens ceste façon tant estrange, que les Stoiciens requeroyent en l’homme, ascauoir qu’il ne fust esmeu de douleur quelconque, mais qu’il fust comme de fer et stupide sans rien sentir</span>;” — “For introducing and establishing among Christians that strange manner of acting, which the Stoics required on the part of an individual—that he should not be moved by any grief, but should be as it were of iron, and stupid, so as to be devoid of feeling.” </p></div></div>
