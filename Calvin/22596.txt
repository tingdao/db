<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet at length concludes that nothing remained for the people but lamentation; for the Lord had resolved to desolate and destroy the whole country. Now they were wont in mourning, as we have seen in other places, to shave and even tear off their hair: and some think that the verb <span class="lang he-il">קרחי</span>, <em>korechi, </em>implies as much as though the Prophet said “Pluck, tear, pull off your hair.” When afterwards he adds <span class="lang he-il">רגזי</span>, <em>regizi, </em>they refer it to shavings which is done by a razor. However this may be, the Prophet here means that the condition of the people would be so calamitous that nothing would be seen anywhere but mourning. </p><p><em>Make bald, </em>he says, <em>for the children of thy delicacies </em><span class="cite-ref">(77)</span> The Prophet here indirectly upbraids those perverse men, who after so many warnings had not repented, with the neglect of God’s forbearance: for whence did those delicacies proceed, except from the extreme kindness of God in long sparing the Israelites, notwithstanding their disobedience? The Prophet then shows here that they had very long abused the patience of God, while they each immersed themselves in their delicacies. Now, he says, <em>Enlarge thy baldness as the eagle </em>Eagles are wont to cast off their feathers; and hence he compares here bald men to eagles, as though he called them, Hairless. As then the eagles are for a certain time without feathers until they recover them; so also you shall be hairless, even on account of your mourning. He says, <em>For they have migrated from thee </em>He intimates that the Israelites would become exiles, that the land might remain desolate. Now follows — </p><p><strong>(77)</strong> Or, “children of thy indulgences or luxuries,” <em>i.e., </em>luxurious children, rather than “darling children,” as rendered by <em>Henderson. </em>The Septuagint has <span class="lang el-gr">τα τεκνα τα τρυφερα σου </span> —”thy voluptuous children.” The version of Newcome is, “thy delicate children.” What seems to be intended is, their indulgence in pleasures and luxuries. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
