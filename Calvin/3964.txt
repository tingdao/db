<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>This is it, that belongeth to the Levites. </em>The age is here prescribed when the Levites should begin and end the execution of their office. God commands them to commence in their 25<span class="cite-ref">th</span> year and grants them their dismissal in their 50<span class="cite-ref">th</span>; and for both these provisions there is very good reason. For, if they had been admitted in early youth, their levity might have greatly detracted from the reverence due to sacred things: not only because those, whose manhood is not yet mature, are generally given to pleasure and intemperance, but because either by negligence, or levity, or want of thought, or ignorance and error, they might have made many grievous mistakes in the service of God; and, whilst they were by no means fitted to exercise their charge until they should have attained prudence and gravity, so also, lest they should fail from old age, it was right that they should be seasonably dismissed; for as we have before said, their duties were laborious, and such as demanded bodily strength. If, however, any should choose to make an application of this to the pastoral office, it should be generally remembered, that none should be chosen to it except such as have already given proofs of their moderation, and float those who diligently devote themselves to it should not be unreasonably pressed upon, nor should more be required of them than their ability can bear; for some foolishly count their years, as if it were a sin to choose a pastor before his 24<span class="cite-ref">th</span> year, although he might be otherwise fully provided with the necessary qualifications. </p></div>
