<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>I will bless Jehovah at all times. </em><span class="cite-ref">(687)</span> David here extols the greatness of God, promising to keep in remembrance during his whole life the goodness which he had bestowed upon him. God assists his people daily, that they may continually employ themselves in praising him; yet it is certain that the blessing which is said to be worthy of everlasting remembrance is distinguished by this mark from other benefits which are ordinary and common. This, therefore, is a rule which should be observed by the saints — they should often call into remembrance whatever good has been bestowed upon them by God; but if at any time he should display his power more illustriously in preserving them from some danger, so much the more does it become them earnestly to testify their gratitude. Now if by one benefit alone God lays us under obligation to himself all our life, so that we may never lawfully cease from setting forth his praises, how much more when he heaps upon us innumerable benefits? <span class="cite-ref">(688)</span> In order to distinguish the praise which he had before said would be continually in his mouth from the empty sound of the tongue, in which many hypocrites boast, he adds, in the beginning of the second verse, that it would proceed from the heart. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(687)</span> “That is, in all circumstances; in every posture of my affairs.” — <em>Horsley. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(688)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand il ne cesse de nous bien-faire</span> ?” —<em>Fr. </em>“When he never ceases from doing us good?” </p></div></div>
