<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And the seventy returned. </em>It is evident, that the faith of the <em>seventy </em>disciples in the words of Christ had not been full and complete, when they <em>returned, </em>exulting over it as a thing new and unexpected, that they had cast out <em>devils </em>by the power of Christ. Nay, they had received this power accompanied by a command. At the same time, I have no doubt that, when they departed, they were convinced that nothing which the Master had said to them would fail of its accomplishment; but afterwards, when the matter proceeded to an extent which surpassed their expectations, they were astonished at the sight. <span class="cite-ref">(51)</span> And this is frequently the case with believers, that they receive from the word but a slight perception of the Divine power, and are afterwards excited to admiration by actual experience. What was the nature of that joy will more clearly appear from Christ’s reply. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(51)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils furent esmerveillez et esbahis de voir cela advenir</span>;” — “they were astonished and overwhelmed at seeing that happen.” </p></div></div>
