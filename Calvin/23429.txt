<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Inquire what person in it is worthy. </em>Again, they might object that they would be deprived of the food to which they were entitled, because nobody would acknowledge them as <em>laborers </em>But Christ meets this difficulty also by ordering them to make <em>inquiry what person </em>in each city is <em>worthy </em>of the message of salvation. By these words, he bids them ask, if there are any godly and upright men, who have some fear and reverence for God, and of whose readiness to receive instruction good hopes may be entertained, that they may direct their labors chiefly to them. For, as they were not at liberty to remain long in any one place, it was proper to begin with those who, in some respect were better prepared. </p><p><em>Remain there till you depart. </em>This too has a reference to dispatch: for if they had made a longer stay in any place, it would have been necessary to change their lodging, that they might not be too burdensome to any individual. When, therefore, Christ enjoins them to remain in the house of the person who shall first receive them, <em>till they depart </em>to another city, he intimates that they must make haste, so that, after having published the Gospel in one city, they may immediately run to another. </p></div>
