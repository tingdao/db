True is that saying, </p><p>“<em>Where </em>your treasure is, there will be your heart also.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_6:21</span>.) </p><p>Whosoever, then, really perceives what fellowship with God is, will be satisfied with it alone, and will no more burn with desires for other things. </p><p>“The Lord is my cup,” says David, “and my heritage; the lines have fallen for me on an excellent lot.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_16:5</span>.) </p><p>In the same manner does Paul declare that all things were deemed by him as dung, in comparison with Christ alone. (<span class="bvs">Phi_3:8</span>.) He, therefore, has at length made a proficiency in the Gospel, who esteems himself happy in having communion with God, and acquiesces in that alone; and thus he prefers it to the whole world, so that he is ready for its sake to relinquish all other things. </p></div>
