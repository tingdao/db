<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah enters here on a new subject. Though he had, no doubt, taught this truth often, yet I consider it as distinct from what has gone before; for he begins here a new attack on those superstitions to which the Jews were then extremely addicted. He exhorts them first to <em>hear the word of Jehovah; </em>for they had so hardened themselves in the errors which they had derived from the Gentiles, and the contagion had so prevailed, that they could not be easily drawn away from them. This, then, is the reason why he used a sort of preface, and said, <em>Hear ye the word of Jehovah, which he speaks to you, O house of Israel </em><span class="cite-ref">(1)</span></p><p>He then mentions the error in which the Chaldeans and the Egyptians were involved; for they were, we know, very attentive observers of the stars. And this is expressly stated, because the Jews despised God’s judgments, and greatly feared what were foolishly divined. For when any one, by looking at the stars, threatened them with some calamity, they were immediately terrified; but when God denounced on them, as with the sound of a trumpet, a calamity by his Prophets, they were not at all moved. But it will be better to examine the very words of the Prophet, as then we shall more plainly see the drift of the whole. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(1)</span> Here the preceding lecture ends in the original; but in order to keep the chapters distinct, this section has been transferred to the present lecture.
