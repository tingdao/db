<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>And Jesus called a child to him. </em>The general meaning is, that those who desire to obtain greatness by rising above their brethren, will be so far from gaining their object that they do not even deserve to occupy the lowest corner. He reasons from contraries, because it is humility alone that exalts us. As we are more powerfully affected by appearances presented to the eyes, he holds up to them <em>a little child </em>as an emblem of humility. When he enjoins his followers to become <em>like a child</em>, this does not extend indiscriminately to all points. We know that in children there are many things faulty; and accordingly Paul bids us be <em>children</em>, not in <em>understanding</em>, but <em>in malice</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Co_14:20</span>;) and in another passage he exhorts us to strive to reach the state of <em>a perfect man</em>, (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:13</span>.) But as <em>children </em>know nothing about being preferred to each other, or about contending for the highest rank, Christ desires that their example should banish from the minds of his followers those eager longings after distinction, which wicked men and the children of the world continually indulge, that they may not be allured by any kind of ambition. </p><p>It will perhaps be objected, that children, even from the womb, have a native pride, which leads them to desire the highest honor and distinction; but the reply is obvious, that comparisons must not be too closely or too exactly carried out, so as to apply at all points. The tender age of little children is distinguished by simplicity to such an extent, that they are unacquainted with the degrees of honor, and with all the incentives to pride; so that they are properly and justly held out by Christ as an example. </p></div>
