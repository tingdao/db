<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>42.</strong><em>Again he went away a second time. </em>By these words Christ seems as if, having subdued fear, he came with greater freedom and courage to submit to the will of <em>the Father; </em>for he no longer asks to have <em>the cup removed from him, </em>but, leaving out this prayer, insists rather on obeying the purpose of God. But according to Mark, this progress is not described; and even when Christ returned <em>a second time, </em>we are told that he repeated <em>the same prayer; </em>and, indeed, I have no doubt, that at each of the times when he prayed, fear and horror impelled him to ask that he might be delivered from death. <span class="cite-ref">(207)</span> Yet it is probable that, at <em>the second time, </em>he labored more to yield obedience to the Father, and that the first encounter with temptation animated him to approach death with greater confidence.Luke does not expressly relate that he prayed three several times, but only says that, when he was pressed with <em>anguish, </em>he prayed with greater copiousness and earnestness, as if he had continued to pray without any intermission. But we know that the Evangelists sometimes leave out circumstances, and only glance rapidly at the substance of what took place. Accordingly, when he says towards the close, that Christ <em>came to his disciples, </em>it is a <em>hysteron proteton; </em><span class="cite-ref">(208)</span> just as, in another clause, he relates that <em>an angel from heaven appeared, </em>before he speaks of Christ’s <em>anguish. </em>But the inversion of the order carries no absurdity; for, in order to inform us that the <em>angel </em>was not sent without a good reason, the necessity for it is afterwards stated; and thus the latter part of the narrative is, in some sort, a reason assigned for the former. Now though it is the Spirit of God alone that imparts fortitude, that does not hinder God from employing <em>angels </em>as his ministers. And hence we may conclude what excruciating distresses the Son of God must have endured, since it was necessary that the assistance of God should be granted to him in a visible manner. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(207)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A requerir qu’il ne veinst point a ceste mort</span>;” — “to ask that he might not com to that death.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(208)</span><em>Hysteron proteron </em><span class="lang el-gr">(ὕστερον πρότερον)</span> is a figure of rhetoric, by which the natural order of events is reversed. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
