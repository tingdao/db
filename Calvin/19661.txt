<div class="comment-content"><p>He afterwards mentioned <em>the priest </em>and <em>all the priests </em>The word <em>priest, </em>in the singular number, meant the high-priest: then the <em>priests </em>were not only those descended from Aaron, but all the Levites. There was the high-priest, and then the descendants of Aaron were the chief, and, as it were, the colleagues of the high priest; but the Levites were an inferior order, though here by the priests he means also the Levites. </p></div>
