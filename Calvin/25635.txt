<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things. They </em>who imagine that Christ was <em>ridiculed by the Pharisees, </em>because he chose to employ a plain and familiar style, and made no use of swelling words, <span class="cite-ref">(302)</span> do not sufficiently comprehend what Luke means. Haughty and disdainful men, I do acknowledge, view the doctrine of the Gospel with contempt; but Luke expressly declares the reason why Christ was the object of their derision to have been, that they <em>were covetous </em>Entertaining a firm and deep-seated conviction that the rich are happy, and that there is nothing better for men than to increase their wealth by every possible method, and earnestly to guard whatever they have acquired, they reject as foolish paradoxes <span class="cite-ref">(303)</span> all the sayings of Christ which had a contrary tendency. And, certainly, any one that speaks of despising riches, or bestowing alms on the poor, is regarded by the <em>covetous </em>as a madman. Horace’s words on this subject are well known: <span class="cite-ref">(304)</span> “The people hiss at me, but I am well satisfied with myself.” <span class="cite-ref">(305)</span> But if, even when they are condemned by universal opinion, they continue to flatter themselves, how much more will they ridicule as a fable that philosophy of Christ which is far removed from the ordinary belief? </p><p>Some other pretense, I have no doubt, was held out by the Pharisees for ridiculing and evading a doctrine which opposed their vice. But we must attend to the motive by which they were actuated; for it is a disease which almost always prevails in the world, that the greater part of men affect to despise whatever does not fall in with their corrupt morals. Hence the ridicule, and jest, and merriment, with which the word of God is frequently assailed; for every man fights in defense of his own vices, and all imagine that their witticisms will serve for a cloud to screen their criminality. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(302)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En affectant des termes exquis, et bien remplissans la bouehe</span>;”— “by affecting nicely chosen words, and that fill the mouth well.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(303)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme choses absurdes, et contre l’opinion commune</span>;” — “as absurd statements, and opposed to the common belief.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(304)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Horace, Poete Latin, dit parlant en la personne d’un avaricieux</span>;” — “Horace, a Latin Poet, says, speaking in the person of a covetous man.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(305)</span> “Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo.”— <em>Sat</em>. 1. 1:66. </p></div></div>
