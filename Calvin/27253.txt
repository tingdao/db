<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>It happened that she was sick. </em>He saith in plain words that she was sick, that he may the more plainly express her death which followed. To the same end he saith that the corpse was washed and laid in an upper chamber; therefore, these circumstances serve to make the miracle to be believed. Whereas they carry her not straightway to the grave, but lay her in the upper part of the house, that they may keep her there, we may thereby gather that they had some hope of recovering her life. It is likely that the rite of washing, whereof Luke maketh mention, was most ancient; and I do not doubt but that it came from the holy fathers by continual course of times, as if it had been delivered from hand to hand, that in death itself some visible and of the resurrection might comfort the minds of the godly, and lift them up unto some good hope; to wit, seeing the manifestation of eternal life was not so evident, yea, seeing that Christ, the pledge and substance of eternal life, was not as yet revealed, it was requisite that both the obscurity of doctrine, and also the absence of Christ, should be supplied by such helps. Therefore they washed the bodies of the dead, that they might once <span class="cite-ref">(635)</span> stand before the judgment-seat of God, being clean. <span class="cite-ref">(636)</span> Finally, there was the same reason for washing the dead which was for the living; the daily washing put them in mind of this, that no man can please God save he who should be purged from his filthiness. So, in the rite of burying, God would have some sign extant whereby men might be admonished that they went polluted out of this life by reason of that filthiness which they had gathered in the world. Washing did no more help those which were dead than burial, but it was used to teach the living; <span class="cite-ref">(637)</span> for because death hath some show of destruction, lest it should extinguish the faith of the resurrection, it was requisite that contrary shows should be set against it, that they might represent life in death. The Gentiles also took to themselves this ceremony, for which cause Ennius saith<em>, A good woman did wash and anoint Tarquinius’s corpse. </em>But (their) imitation was but apish <span class="cite-ref">(638)</span> in this thing, as in all other ceremonies. And Christians also have taken to themselves this example unadvisedly, as if the observation of a figure used under the law ought to continue always; for at the beginning of the gospel, although the necessity were abolished, yet the use was lawful, until such time as it might grow out of use in tract of time. But the monks do at this day no less imitate Judaism than did the Gentiles in times past, without choice and judgment, for they wash corpses, that they may bury Christ in shadows, which, being buried with him in his grave, ought never to have been used any more. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(635)</span> “Ut pura aliquando ad Dei tribunal sisterentur,” that they might one day stand pure at the judgmentseat of God. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(636)</span> “Quotidianae ablutiones,” their daily ablutions. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(637)</span> “Superstites,” survivors. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(638)</span> “Praepostera,” preposterous. </p></div></div>
