<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>At the presence of the Lord </em>Having aroused the senses of men by interrogations, he now furnishes a reply, which many understand to be a personification of the earth; because they take <span class="lang he-il">י</span>, <em>yod, </em>to be the affix of the verb <span class="lang he-il">חולי</span><em>, chuli; </em>and they represent the earth as saying, It is my duty to tremble at the presence of the Lord. This fanciful interpretation is untenable; for the term, <em>earth, </em>is immediately subjoined. Others, with more propriety, considering the <span class="lang he-il">י</span>, <em>yod, </em>in this, as in many other passages, to be redundant, adopt this interpretation: It is reasonable and becoming that the earth should tremble in the presence of the Lord. Again, the term <span class="lang he-il">חולי</span>, <em>chuli, </em>is by many rendered in the imperative mood; which interpretation I readily adopt, as it is most probable that the prophet again makes an appeal to the earth, that the hearts of men may be the more sensibly moved. The meaning is the same, — It must be that the earth quake at the presence of her King. And this view receives confirmation from the term <span class="lang he-il">אדון</span>, <em>adon, </em>being used, which signifies <em>a lord </em>or<em>a master. </em>He then immediately introduces the name <em>of the God of Jacob, </em>for the purpose of banishing from men all notions of false gods. Their minds being prone to deceit, they are always in great danger of allowing idols to usurp the place of the true God. Another miracle is mentioned, in which God, after the passage of the people through the Red Sea, gave an additional splendid manifestation of his power in the wilderness. The glory of God, as he informs us, did not appear for one day only, on the departure of the people; it constantly shone in his other works, as when a stream suddenly issued out of the dry rock, <span class="bvs">Exo_17:6</span>. Waters may be found trickling out from among rocks and stony places, but to make them flow out of a dry rock, was unquestionably above the ordinary course of nature, or miraculous. I have no intention of entering into any ingenious discussion, how the stone was converted into water; all that the prophet means amounts simply to this, that water flowed in places formerly dry and hard. How absurd, then, is it for the sophists to pretend that a transubstantiation takes place in every case in which the Scripture affirms that a change has been produced? The substance of the stone was not converted into water, but God miraculously created the water, which gushed out of the dry rock. </p></div>
