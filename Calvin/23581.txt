<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>41.</strong><em>They shall gather out of his kingdom all stumbling-blocks </em>The words that follow, <em>and those who commit iniquity, </em>are added for the sake of exposition; for it is not intended to point out two different things, but to state, that then will be the full and seasonable time, when all things shall be restored to regular order, and when the <em>wicked </em>shall be removed, who are now <em>stumbling-blocks. </em>They are so called, because not only are their own lives wicked, but they undermine the faith of many, retard others in the right course, draw some entirely aside, and drive others headlong. We ought to draw from this a useful admonition, not to become indolent and careless on account of our being surrounded by so many <em>stumbling-blocks, </em>but to be zealous and active in guarding against them. It reproves also the effeminacy of those who are so delicate, that the smallest possible <em>stumbling-blocks </em>make them turn back. <span class="cite-ref">(216)</span> It is difficult, I admit, not to stumble frequently, and even sometimes to fall, when <em>stumbling-blocks </em>without number lie across our path. But our minds ought to be fortified with confidence; for the Son of God, who commands his followers to walk in the midst of <em>stumbling-blocks, </em>will unquestionably give us strength to overcome them all. He pronounces likewise an awful punishment against any hypocrites and reprobate persons, who now appear to be the most distinguished citizens of the Church. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(216)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils tournent incontinent bride</span>;” — “they immediately wheel about.” </p></div></div>
