<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Therefore shall every one that is meek pray unto thee. </em>Here the Psalmist expressly states that whatever he has hitherto set forth in his own person belongs in common to all the children of God. And this is to be carefully observed, because, from our native unbelief, the greater part of us are slow and reluctant to appropriate the grace of God. We may also learn from this, that David obtained forgiveness, not by the mere act of confession, as some speak, but by faith and prayer. Here he directs believers to the same means of obtaining it, bidding them betake themselves to prayer, which is the true sacrifice of faith. Farther, we are taught, that in David God gave an example of his mercy, which may not only extend to us all, but may also show us how reconciliation is to be sought. The words, <em>every one, </em>serve for the confirmation of every godly person; but the Psalmist at the same time shows, that no one can obtain the hope of salvation but by prostrating himself as a suppliant before God, because all without exception stand in need of his mercy. </p><p>The expression, <em>The time of finding, </em>which immediately follows, some think, refers to the ordinary and accustomed hours of prayer; but others more accurately, in my opinion, compare it <span class="cite-ref">(664)</span> with that place in Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_55:6</span>,) where it is said, “Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near.” It is never out of season, indeed, to seek God, for every moment we need his grace, and he is always willing to meet us. But as slothfulness or dullness hinders us from seeking him, David here particularly intimates the critical seasons when believers are stimulated by a sense of their own need to have recourse to God. The Papists have abused this place to warrant their doctrine, that we ought to have advocates in heaven to pray for us; <span class="cite-ref">(665)</span> but the attempt to found an argument in support of such a doctrine from this passage is so grossly absurd that it is unworthy of refutation. We may see from it, however, either how wickedly they have corrupted the whole Scripture, or with what gross ignorance they blunder in the plainest matters. </p><p><em>In the flood of many waters. </em>This expression agrees with that prophecy of Joel, </p><p>“Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be delivered.” (<span class="bvs">Joe_2:32</span>) </p><p>The meaning is, that although the deep whirlpools of death may compass us round on every side, we ought not to fear that they shall swallow us up; but rather believe that we shall be safe and unhurt, if we only betake ourselves to the mercy of God. We are thus emphatically taught that the godly shall have certain salvation even in death, provided they betake themselves to the sanctuary of God’s grace. Under the term<em>flood </em>are denoted all those dangers from which there appears no means of escape. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(664)</span> In the Septuagint version it is rendered, “In the time of finding favor;” in the Arabic, “In a time of hearing;” and in the Syriac, “In an acceptable time.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(665)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’ils nous faut avoir des advocats au ciel qui prient pour nous</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
