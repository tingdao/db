<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>They have inclosed themselves in their own fat </em>If the translation which is given by others is considered preferable, <em>They have inclosed their own fat, </em>the meaning will be quite the same. Some Jewish interpreters explain the words thus: that being stuffed with fat, and their throat being, as it were, choked with it, they were unable to speak freely; but this is a very meagre and unsatisfactory exposition. By the word <em>fat, </em>I think, is denoted the pride with which they were filled and swollen, as it were, with fatness. It is a very appropriate and expressive metaphor to represent them as having their hearts choked up with pride, in the manner in which corpulent persons are affected from the fat within them. <span class="cite-ref">(365)</span> David complains of their being puffed up with their wealth and pleasures, and accordingly we see the ungodly, the more luxuriously they are pampered, conducting themselves the more outrageously and proudly. But I think there is described by the word <em>fat </em>an inward vice namely, their being inclosed on all sides with arrogance and presumption, and their having become utter strangers to every feeling of humanity. <span class="cite-ref">(366)</span> The Psalmist next declares that this is abundantly manifested in their language. In short, his meaning is, that inwardly they swell with pride, and that they take no pains to conceal it, as appears from the high swelling words to which they give utterance. When it is said, <em>They have spoken proudly with their mouth, </em>the word <em>mouth </em>is not a pleonasm, as it often is in other places; for David means, that with mouths widely opened they pour forth scornful and contemptuous language, which bears testimony to the pride which dwells within them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(365)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme les gens replets se trouvent saisis de leur graisse au dedans</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em>“The sacred writers employ this term [fat] to signify a body pampered to excess by luxury and self-indulgence, <span class="bvs">Psa_73:7</span>; <span class="bvs">Job_15:27</span>.”<em>- French and Skinner’s Translation of the Book of Psalms. </em>There may no doubt be a reference to the personal appearance and sensual indulgence of David’s enemies. But something more is implied. “We know that, in the figurative language of Scripture fatness denotes pride. This connection of ideas is still maintained in the East, where, when it is intended to indicate a proud man, he is said to be fat, or to look fat, whether really so or not.” —<em>Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(366)</span><em>Dr Geddes </em>translates the clause, “Their hearts have they hardened.” “Literally,” says he, “they have closed their midriff; — shut out all compassion from their hearts.” The Hebrew word which is rendered fat is explained by <em>Gesenius</em>, when used figuratively, as denoting a fat, that is, an unfeeling heart. </p></div></div>
