<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And I will lay thy windows with pearls. </em>By these metaphors he shows that the condition of the Church, as has been formerly said, will be far better than at any former period. The Church is compared to a building, which is customary in every part of Scripture. (<span class="bvs">Jer_24:6</span>; <span class="bvs">Mat_16:18</span>.) For this reason he now draws a picture of a costly and magnificent structure. But it ought to be remarked, that the Prophet represents God as the architect of this building; for this work ought to be entirely ascribed to him alone. </p><p>But it may be asked what the Prophet means by “carbuncles, sapphires, pearls,” and other kinds of jewels; for by a similar metaphor Paul meant doctrine. “As a wise architect,” says he, “I have laid the foundation.” And again, </p><p>“If any man build on this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man’s work shall be made manifest.” (<span class="bvs">1Co_3:10</span>) </p><p>Whether or not this be the Prophet’s meaning, will appear from the following verse. </p></div>
