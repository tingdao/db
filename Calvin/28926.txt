<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Sorrow according to God </em><span class="cite-ref">(644)</span> In the <em>first </em>place, in order to understand what is meant by this <em>clause according to God, </em>we must observe the contrast, for the <em>sorrow that is according to God </em>he contrasts with the <em>sorrow of the world </em>Let us now take, also, the contrast between two kinds of joy. The <em>joy of the world </em>is, when men foolishly, and without the fear of the Lord, exult in vanity, that is, in the world, and, intoxicated with a transient felicity, look no higher than the earth. The <em>joy that is according to God </em>is, when men place all their happiness in God, and take satisfaction in His grace, and show this by contempt of the world, using earthly prosperity as if they used it not, and joyful in the midst of adversity. Accordingly, the <em>sorrow of the world </em>is, when men despond in <em>consequence </em>of earthly afflictions, and are overwhelmed with grief; while <em>sorrow according to God </em>is that which has an eye to God, while they reckon it the one misery — to have lost the favor of God; when, impressed with fear of His judgment, they mourn over their sins. This sorrow Paul makes the cause and origin of repentance. This is carefully to be observed, for unless the sinner be dissatisfied with himself, detest his manner of life, and be thoroughly grieved from an apprehension of sin, he will never betake himself to the Lord. <span class="cite-ref">(645)</span> On the other hand, it is impossible for a man to experience a sorrow of this kind, without its giving birth to a new heart. Hence repentance takes its rise in grief, for the reason that I have mentioned — because no one can return to the right way, but the man who hates sin; but where hatred of sin is, <em>there </em>is self-dissatisfaction and grief. </p><p>There is, however, a beautiful allusion here to the term <em>repentance, </em>when he says —<em>not to be repented of; </em>for however unpleasant the thing is at first taste, it renders itself desirable by its usefulness. The epithet, it is true, might apply to the term <em>salvation, </em>equally as to that of <em>repentance; </em>but it appears to me to suit better with the term <em>repentance </em>“We are taught by the result itself, that grief ought not to be painful to us, or distressing. In like manner, although repentance contains in it some degree of bitterness, if, is spoken of as<em>not to be repented of </em>on account of the precious and pleasant fruit which it produces.” </p><p><em>To salvation </em>Paul seems to make repentance the ground of salvation. Were it so, it would follow, that we are justified by works. I answer, that we must observe what Paul here treats of, for he is not inquiring as to the ground of salvation, but simply commending repentance from the fruit which it produces, he says that it is like a way by which we arrive at salvation. Nor is it without good reason; for Christ <em>calls us </em>by way of free favor, but it is <em>to repentance. </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_9:13</span>.) God by way of free favor pardons our sins, but only when we renounce them. Nay more, God accomplishes in us at one and the same time two things: being renewed by repentance, we are delivered from the <em>bondage </em>of our sins; and, being justified by faith, we are delivered also from the <em>curse </em>of our sins. They are, therefore, inseparable fruits of grace, and, in consequence of their invariable connection, repentance may with fitness and propriety be represented as an introduction to salvation, but in this way of speaking of it, it is represented as an <em>effect </em>rather than as a <em>cause. </em>These are not refinements for the purpose of evasion, but a true and simple solution, for, while Scripture teaches us that we never obtain forgiveness of sins without repentance, it represents at the same time, in a variety of passages, the mercy of God alone as the ground of our obtaining it. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(644)</span> “Tristitia secundum Deum;” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">La tristesse qui est selon Dieu</span>;” — “The sorrow which is according to God.” “<span class="lang el-gr">Κατὰ Θεὸν</span>, <em>in such a way as God requires </em>— <em>with reference to his will and glory, i.e., </em>as Rosenm. explains, ‘arising from causes out of which he would have it arise, and producing effects such as he would approve.’” — <em>Bloomfield. </em>—<em>.Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(645)</span> “<em class="lang fr-fr">Ne </em><span class="lang fr-fr">pensons pas que iamais il se convertisse au Seigneur</span>;” — “Let us not think that ever he will turn to the Lord.” </p></div></div>
