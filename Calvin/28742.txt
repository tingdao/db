<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered. He </em>put a bridle upon the impatience of men, when he forewarned them, that the fit time for the new life <span class="cite-ref">(53)</span> would not be before Christ’s coming. But as this world is like a stormy sea, in which we are continually tossed, and our condition is so uncertain, or rather is so full of troubles, and there are in all things such sudden changes, this might be apt to trouble weak minds. Hence he now leads them forward to that day, saying that all things will be set in order. <em>Then, </em>therefore, shall come <em>the </em>end — that is, the goal of our course — a quiet harbour — a condition that will no longer be exposed to changes; and he at the same time admonishes us, that that <em>end </em>must be waited for, because it is not befitting that we should be crowned in the middle of the course. In what respect Christ will <em>deliver up the kingdom to the Father, </em>will be explained in a little. When he says, <em>God and the Father, </em>this may be taken in two senses — either that God the Father is called the God and Father of Christ, or that the name of <em>Father </em>is added by way of explanation. The conjunction <em>et </em><em>(and) </em>will in the <em>latter </em>case mean <em>namely. </em>As to the <em>former </em>signification, there is nothing either absurd, or unusual, in the saying, that Christ is inferior to God, in respect of his human nature. </p><p><em>When he shall have abolished all rule. </em>Some understand this as referring to the powers that are opposed to Christ himself; for they have an eye to what immediately follows, <em>until he shall have put all his enemies, etc. </em>This clause, however, corresponds with what goes before, when he said, that Christ would not sooner <em>deliver up the kingdom </em>Hence there is no reason why we should restrict in such a manner the statement before us. I explain it, accordingly, in a general way, and understand by it — all powers that are lawful and <em>ordained by God. </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_13:1</span>.) In the <em>first </em>place, what we find in the Prophets (<span class="bvs">Isa_13:10</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_32:7</span>) as to the darkening of the sun and moon, that God alone may shine forth, while it has begun to be fulfilled under the reign of Christ, will, nevertheless, not be fully accomplished until the last day; but then <em>every height shall be brought low, </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_3:5</span>,) that the glory of God may alone shine forth. Farther, we know that all earthly principalities and honors are connected exclusively with the keeping up of the present life, and, consequently, are a part of the world. Hence it follows that they are temporary. </p><p>Hence as the world will have an end, so also will government, and magistracy, and laws, and distinctions of ranks, and different orders of dignities, and everything of that nature. There will be no more any distinction between servant and master, between king and peasant, between magistrate and private citizen. Nay more, there will be then an end put to angelic principalities in heaven, and to ministries and superiorities in the Church, that God may exercise his power and dominion by himself alone, and not by the hands of men or angels. The angels, it is true, will continue to exist, and they will also retain their distinction. The righteous, too, will shine forth, every one according to the measure of his grace; but the angels will have to resign the dominion, which they now exercise in the name and by the commandment of God. Bishops, teachers, and Prophets will cease to hold these distinctions, and will resign the office which they now discharge. <em>Rule</em>, and <em>authority, </em>and <em>power </em>have much the same meaning in this passage; but these three terms are conjoined to bring out the meaning more fully. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(53)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, de la resurrection</span>;” — “That is to say, of the resurrection.” </p></div></div>
