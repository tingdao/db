<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>Let the malice of the wicked come to an endow I beseech thee. </em>David, in the first place, prays that God would restrain the malice of his enemies, and bring it to an end; from which it follows, that his affliction had been of long duration. Others suppose that this is rather a dreadful imprecation, and they explain the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">גמר</span>, <em>gamar, </em>somewhat differently. Instead of rendering it to <em>cease, </em>and <em>to come to an end, </em>as I have done, they understand it <em>to make to cease, </em>which is equivalent <em>to destroy </em>or<em>to consume. </em><span class="cite-ref">(109)</span> Thus, according to them, David wishes that God would cause the mischief which the wicked devise to fall upon their own heads: <em>Let the wickedness of the wicked consume them </em>But, in my opinion, the former interpretation is the more simple, namely, that David beseeches God to bring his troubles to a termination. Accordingly there follows immediately after the corresponding prayer <em>Direct thou the righteous, </em>or <em>establish him; </em>for it is of little importance which of these two readings we adopt. The meaning is, that God would re-establish and uphold the righteous, who are wrongfully oppressed, and thus make it evident that they are continued in their estate by the power of God, notwithstanding the persecution to which they are subjected.—<em>For God searcheth the hearts </em>The Hebrew copulative is here very properly translated by the causal particle <em>for, </em>since David, without doubt, adds this clause as an argument to enforce his prayer. He now declares, for the third time, that, trusting to the testimony of a good conscience, he comes before God with confidence; but here he expresses something more than he had done before, namely, that he not only showed his innocence, by his external conduct, but had also cultivated purity in the secret affection of his heart. He seems to set this confidence in opposition to the insolence and boasting of his enemies, by whom, it is probable, such calumnies had been circulated among the people concerning him, as constrained him in his deep affliction to present his heart and reins to be tried by God. Perhaps, also, he speaks in this manner, in order to divest them of all those plausible but false and deceitful pretenses, which they made use of for the purpose of deceiving men, and if they succeeded in doing this they were satisfied. <span class="cite-ref">(110)</span> He shows that, although they might triumph before the world, and receive the applause of the multitude, they, nevertheless, gained nothing, inasmuch as they would, by and by, have to make their appearance before the judgment-seat of God, where the question would not be, What were their titles? or, What was the splendour of their actions? but how it stood as to the purity of their hearts. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(109)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les autres estiment plustost que ce soit une vehemente imprecation, et exposent ce mot Hebrieu un peu autrement.
