<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>For the Jews require a sign </em>This is explanatory of the preceding statement — showing in what respects the preaching of the gospel <em>is accounted foolishness </em>At the same time he does not simply explain, but even goes a step farther, by saying that the Jews do not merely despise the gospel, but even abhor it. “The Jews,” says he, “desire through means of miracles to have before their eyes an evidence of divine power: the Greeks are fond of what tends to gratify human intellect by the applause of acuteness. We,on the other hand, <em>preach Christ crucified</em>, wherein there appears at first view nothing but weakness and folly. He is, therefore, <em>a stumblingblock to the Jews, </em>when they see him as it were forsaken by God. To the Greeks it appears like a fable, to be told of such a method of redemption.” By the term <em>Greeks </em>here, in my opinion, he does not mean simply Gentiles, but has in view those who had the polish of the liberal sciences, or were distinguished by superior intelligence. At the same time by <em>synecdoche</em>, all the others come in like manner to be included. Between Jews and Greeks, however, he draws this distinction, that the former, striking against Christ by an unreasonable zeal for the law, raged against the gospel with unbounded fury, as hypocrites are wont to do, when contending for their superstitions; while the Greeks, on the other hand, puffed up with pride, regarded him with contempt as insipid. </p><p>When he ascribes it to the Jews as a fault, that they are eagerly desirous of signs, it is not on the ground of its being wrong in itself to demand signs, but he exposes their baseness in the following respects: — that by an incessant demand for miracles, they in a manner sought to bind God to their laws — that, in accordance with the dullness of their apprehension, they sought as it were to <em>feel him out </em><span class="cite-ref">(93)</span> in manifest miracles — that they were taken up with the miracles themselves, and looked upon them with amazement — and, in fine, that no miracles satisfied them, but instead of this, they every day gaped incessantly for new ones. Hezekiah is not reproved for having of his own accord allowed himself to be confirmed by a sign, (<span class="bvs">2Kg_19:29</span>, and <span class="bvs">2Kg_20:8</span>,) nor even Gideon for asking a two-fold sign, (<span class="bvs">Jud_6:37</span>.) Nay, instead of this, Ahaz is condemned for refusing a sign that the Prophet had offered him, (<span class="bvs">Isa_7:12</span>.) What fault, then, was there on the part of the Jews in asking miracles? It lay in this, that they did not ask them for a good end, set no bounds to their desire, and did not make a right use of them. For while faith ought to be helped by miracles, their only concern was, how long they might persevere in their unbelief. While it is unlawful to prescribe laws to God, they wantoned with inordinate desire. While miracles should conduct us to an acquaintance with Christ, and the spiritual grace of God, they served as a hindrance in their way. On this account, too, Christ upbraids them, (<span class="bvs">Mar_8:12</span>.) </p><p>A perverse generation seeketh after a sign. </p><p>For there were no bounds to their curiosity and inordinate desire, and for all that they had so often obtained miracles, no advantage appeared to arise from them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(93)</span> There can be no doubt that Calvin refers here to an expression made use of by Paul in his discourse to the Athenians, <span class="bvs">Act_17:27</span><span class="lang el-gr">Εἰ ἄρα γε ψηλαφήσειαν αὐτὸν καὶ εὔροιεν</span> (if haply they may<em>feel him out </em>and find him.) The allusion is to a blind man <em>feeling his way </em>The same word is employed by Plato, (Phoed. <em>footnote </em>47, edit. Forster.) <span class="lang el-gr">̔Ο δε μοι φαινονται ψηλαφῶντες οἱ πολλοι ὣσπερ εν σκοτει</span>, (In this respect the many seem to me to be <em>feeling their way </em>as it were in the dark.) — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
