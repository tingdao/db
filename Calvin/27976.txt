He indeed shows that ignorance is in vain pretended as an excuse by the Gentiles, since they prove by their own deeds that they have some rule of righteousness: for there is no nation so lost to every thing human, that it does not keep within the limits of some laws. Since then all nations, of themselves and without a monitor, are disposed to make laws for themselves, it is beyond all question evident that they have some notions of justice and rectitude, which the Greeks call preconceptions <span class="lang el-gr">προληψεις</span>, and which are implanted by nature in the hearts of men. They have then a law, though they are without law: for though they have not a written law, they are yet by no means wholly destitute of the knowledge of what is right and just; as they could not otherwise distinguish between vice and virtue; the first of which they restrain by punishment, and the latter they commend, and manifest their approbation of it by honoring it with rewards. He sets nature in opposition to a written law, meaning that the Gentiles had the natural light of righteousness, which supplied the place of that law by which the Jews were instructed, so that they were a law to themselves. <span class="cite-ref">(72)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(72)</span> As to the phrase, “these are a law unto themselves,” [<span class="bvs">Venema </span>] adduces classical examples<span class="lang el-gr">— πᾶν τὸ βέλτιστον φαινόμενον ἔστω σοι νόμος ἀπαράβατος </span> “Whatever seems best, let it be to thee a perpetual law.” — <em>Epict. in Ench</em>. , c. 75<span class="lang el-gr">. “τὸ μὲν ορθὸν νόμος ἐστὶ βασιληκός </span> What is indeed right, is a royal law.” — [<span class="bvs">Plato </span>] <em>in Min., </em>page 317. </p><p>The heathens themselves acknowledged a law of nature.
