<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And who is sufficient for these things? </em>This exclamation is thought by some <span class="cite-ref">(349)</span> to be introduced by way of guarding against arrogance, for he confesses, that to discharge the office of a good Apostle <span class="cite-ref">(350)</span> to Christ is a thing that exceeds all human power, and thus he ascribes the praise to God. Others think, that he takes notice of the small number of good ministers. I am of opinion, that there is an implied contrast that is shortly afterwards expressed. “Profession, it is true, is common, and many confidently boast; but to have the reality, is indicative of a rare and distinguished excellence. <span class="cite-ref">(351)</span> I claim nothing for myself, but what will be discovered to be in me, if trial is made.” Accordingly, as those, who hold in common the office of instructor, claim to themselves indiscriminately the title, Paul, by claiming to himself a peculiar excellence, separates himself from the herd of those, who had little or no experience of the influence of the Spirit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(349)</span> Among these is Chrysostom, who, when commenting upon this passage, says: <span class="lang el-gr">᾿Επειδὴ μεγάλα ἐφθέγξατο, ὃτι θυσία ἐσμὲν τοῦ῎῝ ’ Χριστοῦ῎῝ ’ καὶ εὐωδία, καὶ θριαμβευόμεθα πανταχοῦ πάλιν μετριάζει τῷ῎῝ ’ θεῷ῎῝ ’ πάντα ἀνατίθει διὸ καὶ φησὶ, καὶ πρὸς” ταῦτα τίς” ἱκανός; τὸ γὰρ πᾶν τοῦ῎῝ ’ Χριστοῦ, φησιν, εστιν οὐδὲν ἡμέτερον ὁρᾶς’”ἐπεναντίας” ψευδαποστόλοις” φθεγγόμενον οἱ μὲν γὰρ καυχῶνται ὡς” παρ ᾿ ἑαυτῶν εἰσφέροντές” τι εἰς” τὸ κήρυγμα οὗτος” δὲ διὰ τοῦτό φησι καυχᾶσθαι, ἐπειδὴ οὐδὲν αὐτοῦ῎῝ 8217;φησιν εἶναι. — “</span>Having uttered great things — that we are an offering, and a sweet savor of Christ, and that we are made to triumph everywhere, he again qualifies this by ascribing everything to God. Accordingly he says: <em>And who is sufficient for these things? </em>For everything, says he, is Christ’s — nothing is ours: you see that he expresses himself in a manner directly opposite to that of the false apostles. For these, indeed, boast, as if they of themselves contributed something towards their preaching, while he, on the other hand, says, that he boasts on this ground — because nothing, he says, is his.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(350)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Loyale et fidele Apostre</span>;” — “A loyal and faithful Apostle.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(351)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est vne vertu excellente, et bien clair semee</span>;” — “It is a distinguished excellence, and very thin sown.” </p></div></div>
