<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>And the spirits of the Prophets</em>. This, too, is one of the reasons, why it is necessary for them to take turns — because it will sometimes happen that, in the doctrine of one Prophet, the others may find something to reprove. “It is not reasonable,” says he, “that any one should be beyond the sphere of scrutiny. In this way it will sometimes come to a person’s turn to speak, who was among the audience and was sitting silent.” </p><p>This passage has been misunderstood by some, as if Paul had said, that the Lord’s Prophets were not like persons taken with a sudden frenzy, who, when a divine impulse (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐνθουσιασμὸς</span>) had once seized them, <span class="cite-ref">(871)</span> were no longer masters of themselves. <span class="cite-ref">(872)</span> It is indeed true that God’s Prophets are not disordered in mind; but this has nothing to do with this passage of Paul’s writings. For it means, as I have already stated, that no one is exempted from the scrutiny of others, but that all must be listened to, with this understanding, that their doctrine is, nevertheless, to be subjected to examination. It is not, however, without difficulty, for the Apostle declares that their <em>spirits are subject</em>. Though it is of gifts that he speaks, how can prophecy, which is given by the Holy Spirit, be judged of by men, so that the Spirit himself is not judged by them? In this manner, even the word of God, which is revealed by the Spirit; will be subjected to examination. The unseemliness of this needs not be pointed out, for it is of itself abundantly evident. I maintain, however, that neither the Spirit of God nor his word is restrained by a scrutiny of this kind. The Holy Spirit, I say, retains his majesty unimpaired, so as to </p><p>judge all things, while he is judged by no one. <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_2:15</span>.) </p><p>The sacred word of God, too, retains the respect due to it, so that it is received without any disputation, as soon as it is presented. </p><p>“What is it, then,” you will say, “that is subjected to examination?”’ I answer — If any one were furnished with a full revelation, that man would undoubtedly, along with his gift, be above all scrutiny. There is, I say, no subjection, where there is a plenitude of revelation; but as God has distributed his spirit to every one in a certain measure, in such a way that, even amidst the greatest abundance, there is always something wanting, it is not to be wondered, if no one is elevated to such a height, as to look down from aloft upon all others, and have no one to pass judgment upon him. We may now see how it is, that, without any dishonor to the Holy Spirit, his gifts admit of being examined. Nay more, where, after full examination, nothing is found that is worthy of reproof, there will still be something, that stands in need of polishing. The sum of all, therefore, is this — that the gift is subjected to examination in such a way, that whatever is set forth, the Prophets consider as to it — whether it has proceeded from the Spirit of God; for if it shall appear that the Spirit is the author of it, there is no room left for hesitation. </p><p>It is, however still farther asked — “What rule is to be made use of in examining?” This question is answered in part by the mouth of Paul, who, in <span class="bvs">Rom_12:6</span>, requires that prophecy be regulated according to the <em>proportion of faith. </em>As to the passing of judgment, however, there is no doubt, that it ought to be regulated by the word and Spirit of God — that nothing may be approved of, but what is discovered to be from God — that nothing may be found fault with but in accordance with his word — in fine, that God alone may preside in this judgment, and that men may be merely his heralds. </p><p>From this passage of Paul’s writings, we may conjecture how very illustrious that Church was, in respect of an extraordinary abundance and variety of spiritual gifts. There were colleges of Prophets, so that pains had to be taken, that they might have their respective turns. There was so great a diversity of gifts, that there was a superabundance. We now see our leanness, nay, our poverty; but in this we have a just punishment, sent to requite our ingratitude. For neither are the riches of God exhausted, nor is his benignity lessened; but we are neither deserving of his bounty, nor capable of receiving his liberality. Still we have an ample sufficiency of light and doctrine, provided there were no deficiency in respect of the cultivation of piety, and the fruits that spring from it. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(871)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Depuis que leur folie les prenoit, laquelle ils appeloyent vn mouuement Diuin</span>;” — “Whenever their folly seized them, which they called a Divine impulse.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(872)</span> The reference here is manifestly to those who practiced <em>divination</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">Θεομαντεία</span>) of whom there were three sorts among the Grecians, distinguished by three distinct ways of receiving the <em>divine afflatus</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐνθουσιασμὸς.</span>) See Potter’s Grecian Antiquities, volume 1, pp. 349-354.
