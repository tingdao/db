<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>What is the fellowship of the mystery. </em>The publication of the gospel is called a <em>fellowship, </em>because it is the will of God that his purpose, which had formerly been hidden, shall now be shared by men. There is an appropriate metaphor in the words<span class="lang el-gr">φωτίσαι πάντας, </span><em>to enlighten all men, </em>— conveying the thought, that, in his apostleship, the grace of God shines with the brightness of noon-day. </p><p><em>Which hath been hid in God. </em>This is intended, as before, to obviate the prejudice of novelty, — to oppose the rashness of men, who think it improper that they should remain in ignorance of anything whatever. Who will question the right which God has to keep his own purposes concealed, until he shall be pleased to communicate them to men? What presumption, — yea, what madness is it, not to admit that God is wiser than we! Let us remember, therefore, that our rashness ought to receive a check, whenever the boundless height of the Divine foreknowledge is presented to our view. This, too, is the reason why he calls them <em>the unsearchable riches of Christ; </em>intimating that this subject, though it exceeds our capacity, ought to be contemplated with reverence and admiration. </p><p><em>Who created all things by Jesus Christ. </em>This cannot so properly be understood of the first creation as of the spiritual renewal. It is, no doubt, true, and is frequently declared in Scripture, that by the Word of God all things were created; but the connection of the passage lays us under the necessity of understanding by it that renewal which is comprehended in the blessing of redemption. But it may, perhaps, be thought that the apostle is illustrating this renewal, by an argument drawn from the creation. “By Christ, as God, the Father created (<span class="bvs">Joh_1:3</span>) all things; and why, then, should we wonder, if by Christ, as Mediator, all the Gentiles are now brought back to one body?” I have no objection to this view. A similar argument is used by him in another Epistle. </p><p>“For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, is the same who hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Co_4:6</span>.) </p><p>From the creation of the world he concludes, that it is the work of God to enlighten the darkness; but what was visible in the former case is ascribed to the Spirit, when he comes to speak of the kingdom of Christ. </p></div>
