<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_24:1</span><strong>.</strong><em>And Jesus went out. </em>The disciples undoubtedly perceived that Christ was paying, as it were, his last adieu to the temple. It remained, therefor that he should erect a new <em>temple </em>far more magnificent, and that he should produce a more flourishing condition of the kingdom, as had been foretold by the Prophets; for he had nothing to do with that <em>temple, </em>in which every thing was opposed to him. But again, the disciples could not believe that the magnificent splendor of the <em>temple </em>would give way to Christ. And it ought to be carefully observed that, owing to the prodigious costliness of <em>the temple, </em>their eyes were so dazzled by the splendor of its present aspect, that they could scarcely entertain the hope that the kingdom of Christ would arise. They do not, indeed, in express terms acknowledge their hesitation, but they tacitly throw out a suggestion of it, when they allege, in opposition to Christ, the mass of <em>stones </em>which must be got out of the way, and which must indeed be utterly laid low if he intended to reign. Many simple persons of our own day are carried away by a similar admiration of Popery; for, perceiving it to be supported by very great wealth and by immense power, they are filled with absolute amazement, so as to despise a Church of mean and slovenly aspect. Many even think that we are mad in laboring to effect its destruction, as if this were nothing less than an attempt to draw down the sun out of heaven. And yet, there is no reason to wonder that a spectacle so imposing held the disciples of Christ in astonishment; for how great expense that building cost Herod, may be concluded from the single fact, that he kept ten thousand workmen employed on it for eight successive years. Nor is it without reason that they admire the <em>stones </em>which, Josephus tells us, were superlatively beautiful, and were fifteen <span class="cite-ref">(125)</span> cubits in length, twelve in height, and eight in breadth. Besides, so great was the reverence entertained for <em>the temple </em>even in remote districts, that scarcely any person would venture to suppose that it could ever be destroyed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(125)</span> Instead of <em>fifteen, </em>Josephus states the length of each of the stones to have been <em>twenty-five </em>cubits, (Ant. XV. xi. 3) â€” <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
