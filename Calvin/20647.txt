<div class="comment-content"><p>By this verse the Prophet better confirms what I have said, that the events of things are full of eyes, since they depend on the secret commands of God. Because therefore nothing happens unless by God’s command, hence it happens in the multiform changes of things that there is an equable tenor with reference to God. He says therefore that <em>God cried, </em>or the angel, O <em>wheel. </em>We know that wheels are properly without sense: but here the Prophet signifies that God’s voice is heard by all creatures, so that not even the slightest motion happens without that secret instinct. When the air is serene and calm, we do not think that God’s voice reigns there, but we imagine some natural cause: so also when the sky is clouded, when it rains, when storms rise, when other changes happen, in some way or other we exclude God from these actions. But the Prophet, on the contrary, says, <em>that he heard the voice of God when he cried O wheel </em><span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> But God did not exclaim by way of derision, but wished to testify that there was a certain hidden inclination by which all creatures obey his command To this end therefore God exclaims, O wheel, that we should not think that events are rashly moved, or that any agitation arises without control, or that the elements are so gross that they do not obey God, since his voice gives efficacy and vigor to all. </p><p><strong>(220)</strong> Compare <em>Milton </em>here: — </p><p><em>“Wheel within wheel indrawn,</em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Itself instinct with spirit.” </em>— Par. Lost, <em>6:751. </em></p></div>
