<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And Jacob set up a pillar</em>. Though it is possible that he may again have erected a sacred monument, in memory of the second vision; yet I readily subscribe to the opinion of those who think that reference is made to what had been done before; as if Moses should say, that was the ancient temple of God, in which Jacob had poured forth his libation: for he had not been commanded to come thither for the sake of dwelling there; but in order that a fresh view of the place might renew his faith in the ancient oracle, and more fully confirm it. We read elsewhere that altars were built by the holy fathers, where they intended to remain longer; but their reason for doing so was different: for whereas Jacob had made a solemn vow in Beth-el, on condition that he should be brought back by the Lord in safety; thanksgiving is now required of him, after he has become bound by his vow, <span class="cite-ref">(126)</span> that, being strengthened, he may pass onward on his journey. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(126)</span>Nune gratiarum actio ab eo exigitur, postquam reus voti factus est, ut confirmatus alio transeat. The French translation of “postquam reus voti factus est ” is, “<span class="lang fr-fr">apres qu’il a eu jouissance de son souhait</span>,” “after he had obtained the enjoyment of his wish;” and this would read more smoothly than the translation given above; but is “reus voti ” capable of such a version? — Vide Lexicon Facciolati, sub voce reus. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
