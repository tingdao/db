<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Give unto Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty. </em>It was no doubt David’s design to lead all men to worship and reverence God; but as it is more difficult to reduce great men, who excel in rank, to order, he expressly addresses himself to them. It is obvious, that the LXX, in giving the translation, <em>sons of rams, </em><span class="cite-ref">(605)</span> were led into a mistake by the affinity of the Hebrew words. <span class="cite-ref">(606)</span> About the signification of the word, indeed, the Jewish commentators are all agreed; but when they proceed to speak of its meaning, they pervert and obscure it by the most chilling comments. Some expound it of the angels, <span class="cite-ref">(607)</span> some of the stars; and others will have it, that by the great men who are referred to are meant the holy fathers. But David only intended to humble the princes of this world, who, being intoxicated with pride, lift up their horns against God. This, accordingly, is the reason why he introduces God, with a terrific voice, subduing by thunders, hail-storms, tempests, and lightnings, these stubborn and stiff-necked giants, who, if they are not struck with fear, refuse to stand in awe of any power in heaven. We see, therefore, why, passing by others, he directs his discourse particularly to the sons of the mighty. The reason is, because there is nothing more common with them than to abuse their lofty station by impious deeds, while they madly arrogate to themselves every divine prerogative. At least that they may modestly submit themselves to God, and, mindful of their frailty, place their dependence upon his grace, it is necessary, as it were, to compel them by force. David, therefore, commands them <em>to give strength unto Jehovah, </em>because, deluded by their treacherous imaginations, they think that the power which they possess is supplied to them from some other quarter than from heaven. In short, he exhorts them to lay aside their haughtiness, and their false opinion about their own strength, and to glorify God as he deserves. By <em>the glory of God’s name, </em>(ver. 2,) he means that which is worthy of his majesty, of which the great men of this world are wont to deprive him. The repetition, also, shows that they must be vehemently urged ere a proper acknowledgement be extorted from them. By <em>the brightness of God’s sanctuary </em><span class="cite-ref">(608)</span> is to be understood, not heaven as some think, but the tabernacle of the covenant, adorned with the symbols of the divine glory, as is evident from the context. And the prophet designedly makes mention of this place, in which the true God had manifested himself, that all men, bidding adieu to superstition, should betake themselves to the pure worship of God. It would not be sufficient to worship any heavenly power, but the one and unchangeable God alone must be worshipped, which cannot come to pass until the world be reclaimed from all foolish inventions and services forged in the brains of men. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(605)</span> The entire reading of the verse in the Septuagint is, “<span class="lang el-gr">Ενέγκατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ὑιοὶ Θεοῦ ενέγκατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ὑιοὺς κριῶν</span><em>” </em>“Bring to the Lord, ye sons of God, bring to the Lord young rams.” Thus the LXX, as is not unusual in other places, render the words for “Ye sons of the mighty” twice; first, in the vocative case, addressing them, <span class="lang el-gr">Υιοὶ Θεου</span><em>, Ye sons of God, </em>and then in the accusative case, <span class="lang el-gr">ὑιοὺς κριῶν</span><em>, young rams, </em>being apparently doubtful which was the correct rendering, and, therefore, putting down both. The Vulgate, Arabic, and Ethiopic, exactly follow them. <em>Jerome </em>also reads, “Afferte Domino filios arietum;” although he does not give a double translation of the original words. But the correct rendering, we have no doubt, is, “Ye sons of the mighty;” which is just a Hebrew idiomatic expression for “Ye mighty ones,” or, “Ye princes;” and to them the inspired writer addresses an invitation to acknowledge and worship God from the manifestation of his majesty and power in the wonders of nature. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(606)</span> The Hebrew word which Calvin renders <em>“mighty,” </em>is <span class="lang he-il">אלים</span>, <em>elym</em>, a word which means <em>gods. </em>The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">אילים</span>, <em>eylim, </em>which means <em>rams, </em>nearly resembles it, having only an additional <span class="lang he-il">י</span>, <em>yod, </em>and this letter is often cut off in nouns. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(607)</span> The Chaldee paraphrases it thus:— “The assembly of angels, sons of God,” meaning by God <em>angels. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(608)</span> This translation conveys a somewhat different meaning from that of our English version; but it is supported by several critics. <em>Green </em>reads, “In his beautiful sanctuary;” and <em>Fry</em>, “Worship Jehovah with holy reverence,” or, “Worship Jehovah in the glorious places of the sanctuary.” “Where the Hebrews read <span class="lang he-il">בהדרת</span> ” says <em>Hammond</em>, “in <em>the glory </em>or <em>beauty </em>of <em>holiness, </em>from <span class="lang he-il">הדר</span>, <em>to honor, </em>or <em>beautify, </em>the LXX. read, <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν αὐλὣ ἁγίᾳ αὐτου</span><em>, in his holy court, </em>as if it were from, “<em>penetrale, thalamus, area</em>, a closet<em>, </em>a marriage-chamber, a court; and so the Latin and Syriac follow them, and the Arabic, in his<em>“holy habitation.” </em></p></div></div>
