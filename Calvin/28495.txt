<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>I say, then, to the unmarried. </em>This depends on what goes before, and is a sort of inference from it. He had said that the gifts of God are variously distributed — that continency is not in the power of all, and that those who have it not ought to have recourse to the remedy. He now directs his discourse to <em>virgins</em>, to all that are <em>unmarried</em>, and to <em>widows</em>, and he allows that an unmarried life ought to be desired by them, provided they have the power; but that regard must always be had by each individual to the power that he possesses. The sum is this, that an unmarried life has many advantages, and that these are not to be despised, provided every one measures himself according to his own size and measure. <span class="cite-ref">(392)</span> Hence, though virginity should be extolled even to the third heavens, this, at the same time, always remains true — that it does not suit all, but only those who have a special <em>gift </em>from God. For as to the objection that is brought forward by Papists — that in baptism, also, we promise to God purity of life, which it is not in our power to perform, the answer is easy — that in that we promise nothing but what God requires from all his people, but that continency is a special gift, which God has withheld from many. Hence those who make a vow of continency, act precisely as if any unlearned and illiterate person were to set himself off as a prophet, or teacher, or interpreter of languages. </p><p>We must also notice carefully the word <em>continue</em>; for it is possible for a person to live chastely in a state of celibacy for a time, but there must be in this matter no determination made for tomorrow. Isaac was unmarried until he was thirty years of age, and passed in chastity those years in which the heats of irregular desire are most violent; yet afterwards he is called to enter into the married life. In Jacob we have a still more remarkable instance. Hence the Apostle would wish those who are at present practicing chastity, to continue in it and persevere; but as they have no security for the continuance of the gift, he exhorts all to consider carefully what has been <em>given </em>them. This passage, however, shows that the Apostle was at that time unmarried; for as to the inference drawn by Erasmus, that he was married, because he makes mention of himself in connection with married persons, it is frivolous and silly; for we might, on the same principle, infer that he was a widower, <span class="cite-ref">(393)</span> because he speaks of himself in connection with widows. <span class="cite-ref">(394)</span> Now the words intimate, that at that time he was unmarried; for I do not give any countenance to the conjecture, that he had put away his wife somewhere, and had of his own accord abandoned the use of the marriage bed. For where, in that case, had been the injunction, <span class="cite-ref">(395)</span><em>Come together again without delay </em>? (<span class="bvs">1Co_7:5</span>.) It would certainly be an absurdity to say, that he did not obey his own precepts, and did not observe the law which he imposed upon others. It is, however, a singular token of modesty, that, while he is himself endowed with the gift of <em>continency</em>, he does not require others to bind themselves to his rule, but allows them that remedy for infirmity which he dispenses with. Let us, then, imitate his example, so that if we excel in any particular gift, we do not rigorously insist upon it on the part of others, who have not as yet reached that height. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(392)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Se mesure a son aulne (comme on dit) c’est a dire, selon sa faculte</span>;” — “Measures himself by his own ell, (as they say,) that is to say, according to his ability.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(393)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il estoit sans femme</span>,” — “That he was unmarried.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(394)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Entre ceux qui n’estoyent point mariez</span>;” — “Among those that were unmarried.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(395)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car comment se fust-il done acquitte de ce qu’il commande yci aux gens mariez</span> ?” — “For how, in that case, would he have discharged the duty that he enjoins upon married persons?” </p></div></div>
