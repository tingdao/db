<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_11:27</span><strong>.</strong><em>Blessed is the womb. </em>By this eulogium the woman intended to magnify the excellence of Christ; for she had no reference to Mary, <span class="cite-ref">(154)</span> whom, perhaps, she had never seen. And yet it tends in a high degree to illustrate the glory of Christ, that she pronounces <em>the womb that bore him </em>to be noble and <em>blessed. </em>Nor was the blessing inappropriate, but in strict accordance with the manner of Scripture; for we know that offspring, and particularly when endued with distinguished virtues, is declared to be a remarkable gift of God, preferable to all others. It cannot even be denied that God conferred the highest honor on Mary, by choosing and appointing her to be the mother of his Son. And yet Christ’s reply is so far from assenting to this female voice, that it contains an indirect reproof. </p><p><em>Nay, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God. </em>We see that Christ treats almost as a matter of indifference that point on which the woman had set a high value. And undoubtedly what she supposed to be Mary’s highest honor was far inferior to the other favors which she had received; for it was of vastly greater importance to be regenerated by the Spirit of God than to conceive Christ, according to the flesh, in her womb; to have Christ living spiritually within her than to suckle him with her breasts. In a word, the highest happiness and glory of the holy Virgin consisted in her being a member of his Son, so that the heavenly Father reckoned her in the number of new creatures. </p><p>In my opinion, however, it was for another reason, and with a view to another object, that Christ now corrected the saying of the woman. It was because men are commonly chargeable with neglecting even those gifts of God, on which they gaze with astonishment, and bestow the highest praise. This woman, in applauding Christ, had left out what was of the very highest consequence, that in him salvation is exhibited to all; and, therefore, it was a feeble commendation, that made no mention of his grace and power, which is extended to all. Christ justly claims for himself another kind of praise, not that his mother alone is reckoned <em>blessed, </em>but that he brings to us all perfect and eternal happiness. We never form a just estimate of the excellence of Christ, till we consider for what purpose he was given to us by the Father, and perceive the benefits which he has brought to us, so that we who are wretched in ourselves may become happy in him. But why does he say nothing about himself, and mention only the word of God? It is because in this way he opens to us all his treasures; for without the word he has no intercourse with <em>us, </em>nor we with him. Communicating himself to us by <em>the word, </em>he rightly and properly calls us to <em>hear and keep it, </em>that by faith he may become ours. </p><p>We now see the difference between Christ’s reply and the woman’s commendation; for the <em>blessedness, </em>which she had limited to his own relatives, is a favor which he offers freely to all. He shows that we ought to entertain no ordinary esteem for him, because he has all <em>the treasures </em>of life, <em>blessedness, </em>and glory, <em>hidden in him, </em>(<span class="bvs">Col_2:3</span>,) which he dispenses by the word, that they may be communicated to those who embrace <em>the word </em>by faith; for God’s free adoption of us, which we obtain by faith, is the key to the kingdom of heaven. The connection between the two things must also be observed. We must first <em>hear, </em>and then <em>keep; </em>for as <em>faith cometh by hearing, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_10:17</span>,) it is in this way that the spiritual life must be commenced. Now as the simple hearing is like a transitory <em>looking into a mirror, </em><span class="cite-ref">(155)</span> as James says, (1:23,) he likewise adds, <em>the keeping of the word, </em>which means the effectual reception of it, when it strikes its roots deep into our hearts, and yields its fruit. The forgetful hearer, whose ears alone are struck by the outward doctrine, gains no advantage. On the other hand, they who boast that they are satisfied with the secret inspiration, and on this ground disregard the outward preaching, shut themselves out from the heavenly life. What the Son of God <em>hath joined let not men, </em>with wicked rashness, <em>put asunder, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_19:6</span>.) The Papists discover amazing stupidity by singing, in honor of Mary, those very words by which their superstition is expressly condemned, and who, in giving thanks, detach the woman’s saying, and leave out the correction. <span class="cite-ref">(156)</span> But it was proper that such a universal stupefaction should come upon those who intentionally profane, at their pleasure, the sacred word of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(154)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ne faut pas penser qu’elle eust regard a Marie</span>;” — “we must not suppose that she had reference to Mary.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(155)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Autant que l’ouye simple est comme quand on regarde en un mirroir, et que la memoire s’en escoule incontinent</span>;” — “since the simple hearing is as when we look into a mirror, and the remembrance of it immediately passes away.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(156)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et en leurs graces apres le repas, ils prenent le dire de la femme, laissans la correction qui estoit le principal</span>;” — “and in their thanksgivings after a meal, they employ the woman’s saying leaving out the correction, which was the most important matter,” </p></div></div>
