<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Let him abide with God. </em>I have already noticed above, that men are not here bound by a perpetual necessity, so as never to have it in their power to change their condition, if at any time there should be a fit occasion for it; but that he simply represses those thoughtless humors, which hurry men hither and thither, so that they are harassed by a continual restlessness. Hence Paul says, that it is all one in the sight of God what a personâ€™s manner of life is in this world, inasmuch as this diversity does not hinder agreement in piety. </p></div>
