<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>A little while, and you do not see me. </em>Christ had often forewarned the apostles of his departure, partly that they might bear it with greater courage, partly that they might desire more ardently the grace of the Spirit, of which they had no great desire, so long as they had Christ present with them in body. We must, therefore, guard against becoming weary of reading what Christ, not without cause, repeats so frequently. First, he says that he will very soon be taken from them, that, when they are deprived of his presence, on which alone they relied, they may continue to be firm. Next, he promises what will, compensate them for his absence, and he even testifies that he will quickly be restored to them, after he has been removed, but in another manner, that is, by the presence of the Holy Spirit. </p><p><em>And again a little while, and you will see me. </em>Yet some explain this second clause differently: You will see, me when I shall have risen from the dead, but only for a short time; for I shall very soon be received into heaven.” But I do not think that the words will bear that meaning. On the contrary, he mitigates and soothes their sorrow for his absence, by this consolation, that it will not last long; and thus he magnifies the grace of the Spirit, by which he will be continually present with them; as if he had promised that, after a short interval, he would return, and that they would not be long deprived of his presence. </p><p>Nor ought we to think it strange when he says that he is <em>seen</em>, when he dwells in the disciples by the Spirit; for, though he is not <em>seen </em>with the bodily eyes, <span class="cite-ref">(99)</span> yet his presence is known by the undoubted experience of faith. What we are taught by Paul is indeed true, that believers, </p><p>so long as they remain on earth, are absent from the Lord, because they walk, by faith, and not by sight, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Co_5:6</span>.) </p><p>But it is equally true that they may justly, in the meantime, glory in having Christ dwelling in them by faith, in being united to him as members to the Head, in possessing heaven along with him by hope. Thus the grace of the Spirit is a mirror, in which Christ wishes to be seen by us, according to the words of Paul, </p><p>Though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet we know him no more; if any man be in Christ, let him be a new creature, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Co_5:16</span>) </p><p><em>Because I go to the Father. </em>Some explain these words as meaning that Christ will no longer be seen by the disciples, because he will be in heaven, and they on earth. For my part, I would rather refer it to the second clause, <em>You will soon see me</em>; for my death is not a destruction to separate me from you, but a passage into the heavenly glory, from which my divine power will diffuse itself even to you.” He intended, therefore, in my opinion, to teach what would be his condition after his death, that they might rest satisfied with his spiritual presence, and might not think that it would be any loss to them that he no longer dwelt with them as a mortal man. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(99)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien qu’il ne soit point veu des yeux corporels</span>.” </p></div></div>
