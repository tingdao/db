<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_8:29</span><strong>.</strong><em>What have we to do with thee? </em>Willingly would they, by this word, drive him far from them. But when they see that they are held under restraint, and that it is in vain for them to decline his authority, they complain that they are <em>tormented before the time, </em>and likewise mingle entreaty. Thus we see that the devils breathe nothing but rebellion against God; and yet, with all their swelling pride, they are crushed and fall in a moment: for their malice and obstinacy, which is never subdued, ceases not to struggle against the government of God, and yet it is compelled to yield. </p><p>Christ does not openly reject, as he did on other occasions, the confession of the devil; and the reason appears to be, that their enmity towards him was so manifest, as to remove every opportunity of unfavorable or calumnious imputation. Besides, Christ paid regard to the spectators. Accordingly, when malicious and wicked men were present, he was more eager to repress calumnies, and more inclined to put a severe restraint on devils. On the present occasion, it was quite enough that the devils, while they were offering a prayer and entreaty, raged and stormed against him. </p><p><em>Hast thou come hither before the time to torment us? </em>Some explain this kind of <em>torment </em>as consisting in their being compelled to set at absolute liberty the man whom they possessed. Others understand it as referring to the last day of judgment. My view of it is, that they trembled in the presence of their Judge, while they thought of their punishment: for, though Christ said nothing, <span class="cite-ref">(552)</span> a bad conscience told them what they deserved. As criminals, when they come to the judgment-seat, expect their punishment, so devils and all wicked men must tremble at the sight of God, as truly as if they already experienced hell, the unquenchable fire, and the torments that await them. Now, the devils knew that Christ was the Judge of the world; and therefore we need not wonder that the sight of him impressed them with dread of immediate torment. </p><p>Were they acquainted with the day of the last judgment? This question, which some have proposed, is uncalled for. What, then, is the meaning of the phrase, <em>before the time? </em>It means that the reprobate never reckon that <em>the time </em>for punishing them is fully come: for they would willingly delay it from day to day. <span class="cite-ref">(553)</span> Any measure of delay, which the Lord is pleased to allow them, is counted gain; and thus by subterfuges they endeavor to avoid his sentence, though the attempt is to no purpose. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(552)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sans que Christ ouvrist sa bouche</span>;” — “without Christ opening his mouth.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(553)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils voudroyent bien tousjours prolonger leur terme</span>;” — “they would always choose to prolong their time. </p></div></div>
