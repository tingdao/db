<div class="comment-content"><p>Here again the Prophet checks the foolish confidence of the people. The land of Canaan, we know, had been honored by God with the distinction of being a rest; yea God called it, not only the rest of the people, but also his own rest, </p><p>‘I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest,’ <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_95:11</span>.) </p><p>The land of Canaan then was a sort of rest, hidden under the wings of God; for the Lord had assigned it as an inheritance to his chosen people. As God then dwelt in that land, and had also given it to the children of Abraham, that they might rest there in safety, and as this was also one of the blessings contained in the Law, hypocrites said, pursuing their usual course of falsely and groundlessly claiming to themselves the favors of God, that they could not be thence expelled, and that those Prophets were falsifiers who dared to change any thing in God’s covenant. This is the reason why the Prophet now says, </p><p><em>Arise, depart; this is not your rest. </em>“False confidence,” he says, “deceives you, as ye think that ye are inseparably fixed in your habitation. God indeed has made such a promise, but this condition was added, — If ye will stand faithful to his covenant. Now ye are become covenant-breakers: ye think that he is fast bound to you; all the cords are loosened; for as ye have perfidiously departed from the Law of God, there is now no reason for you to think that he is under any obligation to you. There is then no ground for you to boast of being a holy people; you have indeed the name, but the reality has ceased to be: therefore <em>arise and depart: </em>but to sit still securely and proudly will avail you nothing, for God will now drive you afar off: and I now declare to you that you must arise and depart, for ye cannot rest in this land against the will of God: and God will now thrust you out of it.” We now perceive the real meaning of the Prophet. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>For it is polluted; he will scatter you with violent scattering </em><span class="cite-ref">(89)</span> Here again he vindicates God from their calumny and ungodly murmurings. We indeed know how difficult it was to bring down that people, who were steeped in so great a perverseness. And we find that the Prophet had a hard contest with the hypocrites, for the multitude had ever this language in their mouths, — What! is it of no moment that God has favored us with so many and so remarkable promises? Is our adoption nothing but a mockery? Has he in vain given us this land by an hereditary right? Since then hypocrites thus brought forward their privileges in opposition to God, and yet abused them, it was necessary to convince them to the contrary, and this is what the Prophet does here, — “Ye call,” he says, “this land your rest, but how do you rest in it? God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath, for he dwells among you to sanctify you: but ye live disorderly, and carry on war with God himself: have not your pollutions obliterated that holy rest, which has been enjoined on you by God? Ye then see that this change has happened through your fault, that is, that God has ceased to call this land, as he was wont formerly to do, your and his own rest. <em>It is not </em>then <em>your rest; </em>he will therefore <em>scatter </em>you <em>with violent </em>or strong <em>scattering: </em>Ye in vain promise to yourselves rest in this land, since ye carry on war with God, and cease not to provoke his wrath against you.” It follows — </p><p><strong>(89)</strong> The original is <span class="lang he-il">תחבל וחבל נמרף</span>, which, according to Parkhurst, is, “It is bound;” that is, bound over to punishment, “and the bond is grievous;” or, as it may be rendered, strong; which is only found in Niphal in two other places, <span class="bvs">1Kg_2:8</span>; <span class="bvs">Job_6:25</span>. In the first it is rendered, grievous, — “a grievous crime,” and in the second, forcible, — “How forcible are the right words!” </p><p>But most others attach the idea of corruption and destruction to <span class="lang he-il">חבל</span> : and <em>Newcome </em>takes the verb here in a passive sense, and gives this rendering of the distich, — </p><p><em>“Because it is polluted, it shall be destroyed, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And the destruction </em>shall be <em>great.” </em></p><p>Some render the verb actively, “It,” <em>i.e. </em>the land, “shall destroy you,” a reference being made, as it is thought, to what is said in <span class="bvs">Lev_18:25</span>. The version of Marckius is this, — </p><p><em>“ </em><em>Quando quidem impuritas corrumpet, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Et corruptio acris </em><em>.” </em>— </p><p><em>Seeing that impurity will destroy </em>it, <em><LineBreak /></em><em>And a violent destruction. </em></p><p>The previous word <span class="lang he-il">טמאה</span> is here taken as a noun. But the most literal, and the most satisfactory, is the rendering of <em>Newcome. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
