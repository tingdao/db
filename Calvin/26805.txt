<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>I spoke openly in the world. </em>It is a childish error into which some have fallen, who think that this reply of Christ condemns those who expound the word of God in private apartments, when the tyranny of wieked men does not allow them to expound it publicly; for Christ does not argue as to what is lawful and what is not lawful, but his intention was to put down the insolent malice of Caiaphas. </p><p>This passage, however, appears to be inconsistent with another saying of Christ, where he enjoins the apostles to </p><p>proclaim on the house-tops what he had whispered in their ear, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_10:27</span>;) </p><p>and again, when he declares that </p><p>it is not given to all to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_13:14</span>) </p><p>and that he therefore confers this favor on none but the twelve apostles. I answer, when he says in the passage now under review, that <em>he spoke nothing in secret, </em>this refers to the substance of the doctrine, which was always the same, though the form of teaching it was various; for he did not speak differently among the disciples, so as to instruct them in something different; nor did he act cunningly, as if he purposely intended to conceal from the people what he spoke to a small number of persons in the house. He could, therefore, testify with a good conscience that he had openly declared and honestly proclaimed the substance of his doctrine. </p></div>
