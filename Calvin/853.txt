<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And God remembered Rachel</em>. Since with God nothing is either <em>before </em>or <em>after</em>, but all things are present, he is subject to no forgetfulness, so that, in the lapse of time, he should need to be reminded of what is past. But the Scripture describes the presence and memory of God from the effect produced upon ourselves, because we conceive him to be such as he appears to be by his acts. Moreover, whether Rachel’s child was born the last of all, cannot with certainty be gathered from the words of Moses. They who, in this place, affirm that the figure <em>hysteron proteron</em>, which puts the last first, is used, are moved by the consideration, that if Joseph had been born after the last of his brethren, the age which Moses records in <span class="bvs">Gen_41:46</span>, would not accord with the fact. But they are deceived in this, that they reckon the nuptials of Rachel from the end of the second seven years; whereas it is certainly proved from the context, that although Jacob agreed to give his service for Rachel, yet he obtained her immediately; because from the beginning, the strife between the two sisters broke forth. Moses clearly intimates, in this place, that the blessing of God was bestowed late, when Rachel had despaired of issue, and had long been subject to reproach because of her barrenness. On account of this prosperous omen she gave the name Joseph <span class="cite-ref">(82)</span> to her son, deriving the hope of two sons from the prospect of <em>one </em><span class="cite-ref">(83)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(82)</span><span class="lang he-il">יוסף</span>, (<em>Yoseph</em>,) he will add. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(83)</span> “The Lord shall add to me another son.” This may be regarded either as a prophecy respecting Benjamin, or as a prayer which was fulfilled when Benjamin was born. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
