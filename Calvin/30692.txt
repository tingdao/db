<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>These be they who separate themselves</em>. Some Greek copies have the participle by itself, other copies add <span class="lang el-gr">ἑαυτοὺς</span>, “themselves;” but the meaning is nearly the same. He means that they separated from the Church, because they would not bear the yoke of discipline, as they who indulge the flesh dislike spiritual life. <span class="cite-ref">(201)</span> The word <em>sensual</em>, or <em>animal</em>, stands opposed to spiritual, or to the renovation of grace; and hence it means the vicious or corrupt, such as men are when not regenerated. For in that degenerated nature which we derive from Adam, there is nothing but what is gross and earthly; so that no part of us aspires to God, until we are renewed by his Spirit. </p><p><strong>(201)</strong> This is the common interpretation, and yet it seems inconsistent with what is previously said of these men, that they crept in stealthily, and “feasted” with the members of the Church. The <span class="lang el-gr">ἑαυτοὺς</span>, though retained by <em>Griesbach</em>, is excluded by <em>Wetstein </em>and others, being absent from most of the MSS. The verb <span class="lang el-gr">ἀποδιορίζω</span>, means to separate by a boundary two portions from one another, and hence metaphorically to separate or cause divisions: “These be they who cause divisions.” They were doing the same thing as those mentioned by Paul in <span class="bvs">Rom_16:17</span>. They were producing discords<em>in </em>the Church, and not separations<em>from </em>it; and by continuing in it, they became “spots and stains” to its members. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
