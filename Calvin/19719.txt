<div class="comment-content"><p>We see that the Prophet brings forward nothing new, but only animates the Jews with confidence as to their deliverance and their return. He yet employs another similitude, even that God would again <em>sow </em>Judah in the land, that he might produce an increase of men, and also of cattle, and of all kinds of animals. We have said that the land was to be for a time dreary and forsaken. As God then thus condemned as it were the land, that all might regard it as given up to desolation and solitude, the Prophet says that God would cause it to be inhabited again by both men and beasts. </p><p>But the similitude sets forth still more fully the favor of God. There is to be understood a contrast between a cultivated and a deserted land. It is as though one should say, “They shall sow and reap on mountains, where corn has never been, where a plough has never been seen.” Were any one then to promise a sowing and a harvest in a desert land, it would be a new thing, and could hardly be believed. Even so does the Prophet now say, <em>I will sow, etc., </em>as though he said, “The land indeed shall for a time be accursed, so that it will not sustain either men or beasts; but it shall be sown again.” <em>I will sow it, </em>he says, <em>with the seed both of, men and of animals: </em>and thus he meets a question, which might have been asked, “How can it be that the land will be again inhabited, since it is now deserted by its inhabitants?” even because God <em>will sow </em>it. In this way then, the Prophet answers the question. But at the same time he exalts the favor of God, as though he had said, that there would be no other remedy for the barrenness of the land, until God should cultivate it himself, and scatter seed on it: which is the same as to say, that the restoration of the land would not be the work of human industry or power, but of the wonderful power of God. <span class="cite-ref">(49)</span> It follows, — </p><p><strong>(49)</strong> I am disposed to render the latter part of this verse according to the <em>Syriac, </em>— </p><p>That I will sow, as to the house of Israel and the house of Judah, <LineBreak />The seed of man and the seed of beast. </p><p>I take <span class="lang he-il">את</span> as a preposition, which it often is. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
