<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>For you cleanse the outer part. </em>Our Lord follows out the same statement, and employs a figure for reproaching the <em>scribes </em>with being eagerly bent on this single object of making a brilliant appearance before men. For by <em>the outer part of the dish </em>he metaphorically expresses the outward appearance; as if he had said, “You give yourselves no concern about any <em>cleanness </em>but what appears outwardly, which is quite as if one were carefully to wash off the filth of the dish without, but to leave it filthy within.” That the expression is metaphorical is evident from the second clause, in which the uncleanness <em>within </em>is condemned, because <em>within they are full of intemperance and extortion. </em>He therefore reproves their hypocrisy, in not endeavoring to regulate their life, except before the eyes of men, in order to procure for themselves an empty reputation for holiness. Thus he recalls them to the pure and sincere desire of a holy life. <em>Cleanse first, </em>he says, <em>that which is within; </em>for it would be ridiculous to feast your eyes with outward splendor, and yet to drink out of a cup full of dregs, or in other respects filthy. <span class="cite-ref">(103)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(103)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Plene de lie et de bourbe, ou autrement orde et sale</span>;”—full of dregs and of mud, or otherwise nasty and filthy.” </p></div></div>
