<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Let no man trouble me</em>. He now speaks with the voice of authority for restraining his adversaries, and employs language which his high rank fully authorized. “Let them cease to throw hinderances in the course of my preaching.” He was prepared, for the sake of the church, to encounter difficulties, but does not choose to be interrupted by contradiction. <em>Let no man trouble me</em>. Let no man make opposition to obstruct the progress of my work. </p><p><em>As to everything else, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">τοῦ λοιποῦ,</span>) that is, as to everything besides the <em>new creature</em>. “This one thing is enough for me. Other matters are of no importance, and give me no concern. Let no man question me about them.” He thus places himself above all men, and allows to none the power of attacking his ministry. Literally, the phrase signifies, as to <em>the rest </em>or <em>the remainder</em>, which Erasmus, in my opinion, has improperly applied to time. </p><p><em>For I bear </em><span class="cite-ref">(102)</span><em>in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus</em>. This accounts for his bold, authoritative language. And what were those marks? Imprisonment, chains, scourging, blows, stoning, and every kind of injurious treatment which he had incurred in bearing testimony to the gospel. Earthly warfare has its honors, in conferring which a general holds out to public view the bravery of a soldier. So Christ our leader has his own marks, of which he makes abundant use, for conferring on some of his followers a high distinction. These marks, however, differ from the other in one important respect, that they partake of the nature of the cross, and in the sight of the world are disgraceful. This is suggested by the word translated <em>marks</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">στίγματα,</span>) for it literally denotes the <em>marks </em>with which barbarian slaves, or fugitives, or malefactors, were usually branded. Paul, therefore, can hardly be said to use a figure, when he boasts of shining in those marks with which Christ is accustomed to honor his most distinguished soldiers, <span class="cite-ref">(103)</span> which in the eye of the world were attended by shame and disgrace, but which before God and the angels surpass all the honors of the world. <span class="cite-ref">(104)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(102)</span><span class="lang el-gr">Οὐκ εἴπε δὲ ἔχω ἀλλὰ βαστάζω ὣσπερ τι τρόπαιον ἢ σημεῖον βασιλικὸν καὶ τούτοις ἐναβρύνομαι</span>. “He does not say, I have, but, I bear, as some trophy or royal symbol; and I deck myself with them.” — Theophylact </p><p><span class="cite-note">(103)</span> “There is no warlike weapon, <span class="lang el-gr">οὖγε οὐκ ἴχνη ἐν ἐμαυτῷ φέρω</span>, of which I do not bear the marks upon me.” — Arrian. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(104)</span> “So far am I from being liable to be torn away from the truth of the gospel, by any reproaches or afflictions, that the disgrace inflicted on me for Christ’s sake, and the imprisonment, and scourging, and bonds, and stonings, and other distresses which I have endured for the name of Christ, shall be carried about with me, in my body, wherever I go, as marks and tokens of my Lord Jesus Christ. I will exhibit them as so many trophies, and will reckon it to be my glory, that I am counted worthy to imitate, in any manner, the cross of Christ which I preach.”-Erasmus’s Paraphrase. </p></div></div>
