<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>And Moses said unto the children of Gad. </em>So sharp and severe a reproof shews us the greatness of the wrong: for neither did inconsiderate warmth carry away Moses into such violent anger, nor did he fall into error, so as to deliver his opinion on a point which he did not well understand. He knew, therefore, what the sons of Gad and Reuben asked; and hence he inveighed against them thus vehemently, because they desired to lacerate the body of the Church by this wicked severance. He begins by expostulating with them with regard to their sinful and unreasonable covetousness, in that they sought to indulge in idleness, when their brethren were about to march through a hostile land; for they were possessed of no rightful superiority, so as to throw upon the others all the labors, perils, and burdens of the war. Since, therefore, God had imposed the same condition upon all, <span class="cite-ref">(213)</span> it was not right that part of them should be exempted from it, as if by privilege. More severely, however, is their ingratitude and perverseness towards God chastised, than their injustice towards their brethren, whilst he alleges to their reproach, that thus the hearts of the children of Israel would be broken, <span class="cite-ref">(214)</span> so that they wouht refuse to obey the call of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(213)</span> “Que Dieu les avoit conjoints ensemble, afin que les uns teinssent compagnie aux autres;” that God had united them together, so that they should keep company with each other. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(214)</span> See Margin, <em>A.V., </em><span class="bvs">Num_32:7</span>, “<em>Heb</em>. break.” </p></div></div>
