<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>Then Joshua. passed, </em>etc We have now a description of the taking of the cities, out of which the army of the enemy had been raised; and herein God displayed his power no less wonderfully than in the open field, especially when the rapidity is considered. For although those who had fled hither in trepidation might have produced some degree of panic, still, when the fear was allayed, they might be useful for defense. <span class="cite-ref">(104)</span> The garrison had been increased by their numbers. When, therefore, in a short period of time, Joshua takes all the cities, and gains possession of the smaller towns, the presence of God was conspicuously manifested in a success no less incredible than unexpected. For had they, when attacked, only shut their gates, as Joshua had not brought either ladders by which he might scale the walls, or engines by which he might throw them down, each siege might have been attended with considerable fatigue and delay. Therefore, when he takes one the following day, and another the very day after attacking it, these continued, easy, and rapid victories, are evidently beyond human agency. </p><p>Not without cause, then, in the end of the chapter, is the goodness of God expressly celebrated, as it had been made manifest that he was fighting for Israel, when Joshua at once took and vanquished so many kings, with their territories. Indeed, he could never, even in a course of inspection, have passed so quickly from city to city, had not a passage been divinely opened by the removal of obstacles. The miracle was increased when the king of Geser, who had come to the help of others, doubtless with full confidence in the result, was suddenly put to rout, almost without an effort, and did not even delay the advance of the Israelites. Those who were slain in the cities represent, as in a mirror, those whose punishment the Almighty holds suspended, while he actually takes vengeance on others. For though they plume themselves on the reprieve thus afforded them, their condition is worse than if they were immediately dragged to death. <span class="cite-ref">(105)</span> It looks as if it would have been a dire calamity to fall in the field of battle; and making their escape, they seek safety within their walls. But what awaited them there was much more dreadful. Their wives and their children are butchered in their sight, and their own death is more ignominious than if they had perished sword in hand. Hence there is no reason to envy the reprobate the short time which the Lord sometimes grants them, because when they have begun to promise themselves safety, sudden destruction will come upon them. (<span class="bvs">1Th_5:3</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(106)</span> Meanwhile, let us learn not to abuse the patience of God when he defers to execute his judgment, and, instead of indulging in self-complacency when we seem to have been delivered from any danger, or when means of escape from it present themselves, let us reflect on the words of Jeremiah, (<span class="bvs">Jer_24:2</span>) that while the basket of early figs <span class="cite-ref">(107)</span> had at least some savor, the other was so sour that they could not be eaten. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(104)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils pourroyentt servir de defense pour garder les villes</span>;” “They might serve for defense to guard the towns.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(105)</span> Latin, “Quam si mox ad mortem traherentur.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que s’ils estoyent depeschez soudainement sur le champ</span>;” “Than if they were dispatched suddenly on the spot.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(106)</span> The original text had the reference to <span class="bvs">2Th_5:3</span>, an obvious typesetting error. —<em>fj. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(107)</span> Latin, “Ficus praecoces.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les figues hastives</span>;” “Precocious figs, or figs too hastily ripened.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
