<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>43.</strong><em>Follow me. </em>When <em>Philip </em>was inflamed by this single word to follow Christ, we infer from it how great is the efficacy of the word of God; but it does not appear indiscriminately in all, for God addresses many without any advantage, just as if he struck their ears with a sound which vanished into air. So then the external preaching of the word is in itself unfruitful, except that it inflicts a deadly wound on the reprobate, so as to render them inexcusable before God. But when the secret grace of God quickens it, all the senses must be affected in such a manner that men will be prepared to <em>follow </em>wherever God calls them. We ought, therefore, to pray to Christ that he may display in us the same power of the Gospel. In the case of <em>Philip, </em>there was no doubt a peculiarity about his <em>following </em>Christ; for he is commanded to follow, not like one of us, but as a domestic, and as a familiar companion. But still the calling of all of us is illustrated by this calling of <em>Philip. </em></p></div>
