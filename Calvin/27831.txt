<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Why should </em>I do not doubt but that he proved that both by reason, and also by testimonies of Scripture, which he taught concerning the resurrection and the heavenly life. But for good causes doth he call back those unto whom he speaketh unto the power of God, lest they judge thereof according to their own weak capacity. For nothing can more hardly sink into men’s brains, than that men’s bodies shall be restored when as they be once consumed.<span class="cite-ref">(611)</span> Therefore, seeing it is a mystery far surpassing man’s wit, let the faithful remember how far the infinite power of God doth reach, and not what they themselves comprehend; as the same Paul teacheth in the third chapter to the Philippians ( <span class="bvs">Phi_3:21</span>). For when he hath said that our vile bodies shall be made like to the glorious body of Christ, he addeth immediately, “according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.” But men are for the most part injurious<span class="cite-ref">(612)</span> to God, who will not have his arm to reach any farther than their understanding and reason can reach; so that so much as in them lieth they would desire to restrain the greatness of his works (which surpasseth heaven and earth) unto their straits.<span class="cite-ref">(613)</span> But, on the other side, Paul commandeth us to consider what God is able to do, that being lifted up above the world, we may learn to conceive the faith of the resurrection, not according to the weak capacity of our mind, but according to his omnipotency. </p><p><strong>(611)</strong></p><p>“ Ubi in nihilum redacta fuerint,” after being reduced to nothing. </p><p><strong>(612)</strong></p><p>“ Maligni... et injurii,” malignant and injurious, </p><p><strong>(613)</strong></p><p>“ Ad suas angustias,” to their narrow capacity. </p></div>
