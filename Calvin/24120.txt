<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>65.</strong><em>Then the high priest rent his garments. </em>By this we see how little advantage was derived by wicked men from the miracles by which Christ had proved his Divinity. But we need not wonder, that under the mean garb of a servant, the Son of God was despised by those who were unmoved by any anxiety about the promised salvation. For if they had not entirely laid aside every pious feeling, their deplorable condition ought to have led them to look anxiously for the Redeemer; but when they now, without making any inquiry, reject him when offered to them, do they not as far as lies in their power, destroy all the promises of God? <em>The high priest </em>first pronounces Christ to be a blasphemer, to which the others afterwards assent. The <em>rending of the clothes </em>plainly shows how boldly and wickedly those who profanely despise God make false pretensions of zeal. It would indeed have been praiseworthy in <em>the high priest, </em>if he heard the name of God shamefully profaned, not only to feel inward resentment and excruciating pain, but to make an open display of his detestation; but while he refused to make inquiry, he contrived an unfounded charge of <em>blasphemy. </em>And yet, this treacherous hypocrite, while he assumed a character which did not belong to him, taught the servants of God with what severity of displeasure they ought to regard blasphemies, and condemned by his example the shameful cowardice of those who are no more affected by an outrage on religion, than if they heard buffoons uttering their silly jokes. </p><p><em>Then they spat in his face. </em>Either Luke has inverted the order of the narrative, or our Lord twice endured this highly contemptuous treatment. The latter supposition appears to me to be probable. And yet, I have no doubt that the servants were emboldened to <em>spit </em>on Christ, and to <em>strike </em>him with greater insolence, after they had seen that the council, so far as their decision had influence, condemned him to death. The object of all these expressions of contempt was, to show that nothing was more unlikely than that he should be a prince of prophets, who, in consequence of being blindfolded, <span class="cite-ref">(233)</span> was not able even to ward off <em>blows. </em>But this insolence was turned by the providence of God to a very different purpose; for the face of Christ, dishonored by <em>spitting </em>and <em>blows, </em>has restored to us that image which had been disfigured, and almost effaced, by sin. </p><p><strong>(233)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lequel ayant seulement un voile devant les yeux</span>;” — “who having only a veil before his eyes.” </p></div>
