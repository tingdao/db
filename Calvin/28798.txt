<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>If any man love not the Lord Jesus </em>The close of the Epistle consists of <em>three </em>parts. He entreats the grace of Christ in behalf of the Corinthians: he makes a declaration of his love towards them, and, with the severest threatening, he inveighs against those that falsely took upon themselves the Lord’s name, while not loving him from the heart. For he is not speaking of strangers, who avowedly hated the Christian name, but of pretenders and hypocrites, who troubled the Churches for the sake of their own belly, or from empty boasting. <span class="cite-ref">(176)</span> On such persons he denounces an anathema, and he also pronounces a curse upon them. It is not certain, however, whether he desires their destruction in the presence of God, or whether he wishes to render them odious — nay, even execrable, in the view of believers. Thus in <span class="bvs">Gal_1:8</span>, when pronouncing one who corrupts the Gospel to be <em>accursed, </em><span class="cite-ref">(177)</span> he does not mean that he was rejected or condemned by God, but he declares that he is to be abhorred by us. I expound it in a simple way as follows: “Let them perish and be cut off, as being the pests of the Church.” And truly, there is nothing that is more pernicious, than that class of persons, who prostitute a profession of piety to their own depraved affections. Now he points out the origin of this evil, when he says, that they do not love Christ, for a sincere and earnest love to Christ will not suffer us to give occasion of offense to brethren. <span class="cite-ref">(178)</span></p><p>What he immediately <em>adds </em>— <em>Maranatha, </em>is somewhat more difficult. Almost all of the ancients are agreed, that they are Syriac terms. <span class="cite-ref">(179)</span><em>Jerome, </em>however, explains it: <em>The Lord cometh; </em>while others render it, <em>At the coming of the Lord, </em>or, <em>Until the Lord comes. </em>Every one, however, I think, must see how silly and puerile is the idea, that the Apostle spoke to Greeks in the Syriac tongue, when meaning to say — <em>The Lord has come. </em>Those who translate it, <em>at the coming of the Lord, </em>do so on mere conjecture; and besides, there is not much plausibility in that interpretation. How much more likely it is, that this was a customary form of expression among the Hebrews, when they wished to excommunicate any one. For the Apostles never speak in foreign tongues, except when they repeat anything in the person of another, as for example, <em>Eli, Eli, lammah sabathani, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_27:46</span>,) <em>Talitha cumi, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mar_5:41</span>,) and <em>Ephphata, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mar_7:34</span>,) or when they make use of a word that has come into common use, as <em>Amen </em>— <em>Hosanna. </em>Let us see, then, whether <em>Maranatha </em>suits with excommunication. Now Bullinger, <span class="cite-ref">(180)</span> on the authority of Theodore Bibliander, has affirmed, that, in the Chaldee dialect, <em>Maharamata </em>has the same meaning as the Hebrew term <span class="lang he-il">חרם</span>, <em>cherem, (accursed,) </em><span class="cite-ref">(181)</span> and I was myself at one time assured of the same thing by Wolfgang Capito, <span class="cite-ref">(182)</span> a man of blessed memory It is nothing unusual, however, for the Apostles to write such terms differently from the way in which they are pronounced in the language from which they are derived; as may be seen even from the instances brought forward above. Paul, then, after pronouncing an anathema on those who <em>do not love Christ, </em><span class="cite-ref">(183)</span> deeply affected with the seriousness of the matter, as if he reckoned that he had not said enough, added a term that was in common use among the Jews, and which they made use of in pronouncing a sentence of anathema — just as if, speaking in Latin, I should say, “I excommunicate thee,” but if I add — “and pronounce thee an anathema,” this would be an expression of more intense feeling. <span class="cite-ref">(184)</span></p><p>END OF THE COMMENTARIES ON THE FIRST EPISTLE. </p><p><strong>(176)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne cherehans que le proufit de lents ventres, et leur propre gloire</span>;” “Seeking only the profit of their bellies, and their own glory.” </p><p><strong>(177)</strong> Calvin, when commenting on <span class="bvs">Gal_1:8</span>, remarks that the original term there employed, <em>anathema, </em>denotes <em>cursing, </em>and answers to the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">חרם</span>; and he explains the expression — “let him be accursed,” as meaning, “Let him be held by you as accursed.” </p><p><strong>(178)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car si nous aimons Christ purement, et a bon escient, ce nous sera vne bride qui nons retiendra de donner scandale a nos fieres</span>;<em>” </em>— <em>“ </em>For if we love Christ sincerely and in good earnest, this will be a bridle to restrain us from giving offense to our brethren.” </p><p><strong>(179)</strong><em>“ </em><em class="lang fr-fr">Que </em><span class="lang fr-fr">ce sont mots empruntez de la langue Syrienne</span>;” — “That they are words borrowed from the Syriac language.” </p><p><strong>(180)</strong> Beza, in his poems, has recorded the following tribute to the memory of this distinguished man — </p><p>“Henrici Bullingeri, Ecclesiastae Tigurini, spectatisa, doctrine, pictaris, et eximii candoris viri, memoriae;” — (To the memory of HENRY Bullinger, ecclesiastick of Tigurum, a man most distinguished for learning and piety, and extraordinary candour.) </p><p>“Doctrina si interire, si Pietas mori, <LineBreak />Occidere si Candor potest: <LineBreak />Doctrina, Pietas, Candor, hoc tumulo iacent, <LineBreak />Henrice, tecum condita. <LineBreak />Mori sed absit ilia posse dixerim; <LineBreak />Quae viuere jubent mortnos, <LineBreak />Immo interire forsan ilia si queant <LineBreak />Subireque tumuli specum, <LineBreak />Tu tu, illa doctis, tu piis, tu candidis, <LineBreak />Et non mori certissimis, <LineBreak />Edaci ab ipsa morte chartis asseras, <LineBreak />Ipso approbante Numine. <LineBreak />Foedus beatum! mortuum ilia to excitant, <LineBreak />Et tu mori ilia non sinis: <LineBreak />At hunc, amici, cur fleamus mortuum, <LineBreak />Qui viuat aliis et sibi ?” </p><p>“If Learning could expire, if Piety could die, <LineBreak />If Candour could sink down, <LineBreak />Learning, Piety, Candour, are laid in this mound, <LineBreak />O Henry, buried along with thee! <LineBreak />But forbid that I should say that those things could die, <LineBreak />Which command the dead to live. <LineBreak />Nay, if they could possibly expire, <LineBreak />And be entombed, <LineBreak />Thou, by thy writings learned, pious, candid, <LineBreak />And perfectly secured against death, <LineBreak />Wouldst shield them from devouring death, <LineBreak />The Deity himself approving. <LineBreak />Blessed agreement!
