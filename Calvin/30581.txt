<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>Now are we the sons of God </em>He comes now to what every one knows and feels himself; for though the ungodly may not entice us to give up our hope, yet our present condition is very short of the glow of God’s children; for as to our body we are dust and a shadow, and death is always before our eyes; we are also subject to thousand miseries, and the soul is exposed to innumerable evils; so that we find always a hell within us. The more necessary it is that all our thoughts should be withdrawn from the present view of things, lest the miseries by which we are on every side surrounded and almost overwhelmed, should shake our faith in that felicity which as yet lies hid. For the Apostle’s meaning is this, that we act very foolishly when we estimate what God has bestowed on us according to the present state of things, but that we ought with undoubting faith to hold to that which does not yet appear. </p><p><em>But we know that when he shall appear </em>The conditional particle ought to be rendered as an adverb of time, <em>when </em>But the verb <em>appear </em>means not the same thing as when he used it before. The Apostle has just said, <em>it does not yet appear what we shall be</em>, because the fruit of our adoption is as yet hid, for in heaven is our felicity, and we are now far away traveling on the earth; for this fading life, constantly exposed to hundred deaths, is far different from that eternal life which belongs to the children of God; for being enclosed as slaves in the prison of our flesh, we are far distant from the full sovereignty of heaven and earth. But the verb now refers to Christ, <em>when</em>, <em>he shall appear</em>; for he teaches the same thing with Paul, in Colossians, where he says, </p><p>“Your life is hid with Christ in God: when Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Col_3:3</span>) </p><p>For our faith cannot stand otherwise than by looking to the coming of Christ. The reason why God defers the manifestation of our glory is this, because Christ is not manifested in the power of his kingdom. This, then, is the only way of sustaining our faith, so that we may wait patiently for the life promised to us. As soon as any one turns away the least from Christ, he must necessarily fail. <span class="cite-ref">(76)</span></p><p>The word <em>to know</em>, shews the certainty of faith, in order to distinguish it from opinion. Neither simple nor universal knowledge is here intended, but that which every one ought to have for himself, so that he may feel assured that he will be sometime like Christ. Though, then, the manifestation of our glory is connected with the coming of Christ, yet our knowledge of this is well founded. </p><p><em>We shall be like him </em>He does not understand that we shall be equal to him; for there must be some difference between the head and the members; but we shall be like him, because <em>he will make our vile body conformable to his glorious body</em>, as Paul also teaches us in <span class="bvs">Phi_3:21</span>. For the Apostle intended shortly to shew that the final end of our adoption is, that what has in order preceded in Christ, shall at length be completed in us. </p><p>The reason that is added may, however, seem inappropriate. For if to see Christ makes us like him, we shall have this in common with the wicked, for they shall also see his glory. To this I reply, that this is to see him as a friend, which will not be the <em>case </em>with the wicked, for they will dread his presence; nay, they will shun God’s presence, and be filled with terror; his glow will so dazzle their eyes, that they will be stupefied and confounded. For we see that Adam, conscious of having done wrong, dreaded the presence of God. And God declared this by Moses, as a general truth as to men, </p><p>“No man shall see me and live.” (<span class="bvs">Exo_33:20</span>.) </p><p>For how can it be otherwise but that God’s majesty, as a consuming fire, will consume us as though we were stubble, so great is the weakness of our flesh. But as far as the image of God is renewed in us, we have eyes prepared to see God. And now, indeed, God begins to renew in us his own image, but in what a small measure! Except then we be stripped of all the corruption of the flesh, we shall not be able to behold God face to face. </p><p>And this is also expressed here, <em>as he is </em>He does not, indeed, say, that there is no seeing of God now; but as Paul says, </p><p>“We see now through a glass, darkly.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_13:12</span>.) </p><p>But he elsewhere makes a difference between this way of living, and the seeing of the eye. In short, God now presents himself to be seen by us, not such as he is, but such as we can comprehend. Thus is fulfilled what is said by Moses, that we see only as it were his back, (<span class="bvs">Exo_33:23</span>;) for there is too much brightness in his face. </p><p>We must further observe, that the manner which the Apostle mentions is taken from the effect, not from the cause; for he does not teach us, that we shall be like him, because we shall see him; but he hence proves that we shall be partakers of the divine glory, for except our nature were spiritual, and endued with a heavenly and blessed immortality, it could never come so nigh to God yet the perfection of glory will not be so great in us, that our seeing will enable us to comprehend all that God is; for the distance between us and him will be even then very great. </p><p>But when the Apostle says, that <em>we shall see him as he is</em>, he intimates a new and an ineffable manner of seeing him, which we enjoy not now; for as long as we walk by faith, as Paul teaches us, we are absent from him. And when he appeared to the fathers, it was not in his own essence, but was ever seen under symbols. Hence the majesty of God, now hid, will then only be in itself seen, when the veil of this mortal and corruptible nature shall be removed. </p><p>Refined questions I pass by: for we see how Augustine tormented himself with these, and yet never succeeded, both in his Epistles to Paulus and Fortunatus, and in the City of God, (2:2,) and in other places. What he says, however, is worthy of being observed, that the way in which we live avails more in this inquiry than the way in which we speak, and that we must beware, lest by wrangling as to the manner in which God can be seen, we lose that peace and holiness without which no one shall see him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(76)</span> “When he shall appear,” refers to Christ, mentioned in the 28<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse of the last chapter; what intervenes seems to have been parenthetically introduced. This is often the manner of writing found in this apostle. The end of the 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, in this chapter, is connected with the 16<span class="cite-ref">th</span>; for the antecedent to <span class="lang el-gr">ἐκεῖνος</span>, <em>he</em>, in the latter verse, is “the Son of God” in the former.
