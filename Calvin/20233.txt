<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here obviates the doubts of many; for as he had spoken of the destruction of Babylon, it might have been readily objected, that the monarchy which was fortified by so many defenses, and which had subjugated all the neighboring nations, was impregnable. Hence the Prophet here shows that the power and wealth of Babylon were no hindrances that God should not destroy it whenever he pleased; for it is an argument derived from what is contrary. We have before seen that God roots up what he has planted, (<span class="bvs">Jer_45:4</span>;) and then we have seen the metaphor of the potter and his vessels. When the Prophet went down to the potter, he saw a vessel formed and then broken at the will and pleasure of the potter (<span class="bvs">Jer_18:2</span>.) So also now God shows that the destruction was as it were in his hand, because the Chaldeans had not raised themselves to eminence through their own power, but he had raised them, and employed them for his own purpose. In short, he compares the Babylonians in this passage to a formed vessel, and he makes himself the potter: </p><p>“I am he who has raised Babylon to so great a height; it therefore belongs to me to pull it down whensoever it pleases me.” </p><p>We now understand the design of this passage, though the Prophet employs different words. </p><p>He says that Babylon was a <em>hammer and weapons of war to break in pieces </em>the nations. The verb <span class="lang he-il">נפף</span>, <em>nuphets, </em>means to break in pieces, and carelessly to scatter here and there, and also violently to scatter. He says then, “I have by thee scattered the nations, and by thee have destroyed kingdoms.” But as the Chaldeans had enjoyed so many victories and had subjugated so many nations, he adds, <em>I have by thee broken in pieces the horse and his ride,; the chariot and its rider; </em>and then, <em>I have broken in pieces men and women, old men and children, the young men and the maidens, the shepherds and also their flocks </em>He enumerates here almost all kinds of men. He then mentions <em>husbandmen </em>and <em>yokes of oxen, </em>or of horses; and lastly, he mentions <em>captains and rulers </em><span class="cite-ref">(87)</span> All these things are said by way of concession; but yet the Prophet reminds us that no difficulty would prevent God to destroy Babylon, because Babylon in itself was nothing. According to this sense, then, it is called a hammer. In short, the Prophet takes away the false opinion which might have otherwise disturbed weak minds, as though Babylon was wholly invincible. He shows at the same time that God executed his judgments on all nations by means of Babylon. Thus the faithful might have been confirmed; for otherwise they must have necessarily been cast down when they regarded the formidable power of Babylon; but when they heard that it was only a hammer, and that they would not have been broken in pieces by the Babylonians had they not been armed from above, or rather had they not been driven on by a celestial power, it then appeared that the calamity which the Jews had suffered was nothing more than a punishment inflicted by God’s hand. When, therefore, they heard this, it was no small consolation; it kept them from succumbing under their miseries, and from being swallowed up with sorrow and despair. But it now follows, — </p><p><strong>(87)</strong> Many render this passage in the future tense, according to all the Versions and the <em>Targ</em>. , and consider Cyrus to be intended by the “hammer;” but they render <span class="lang he-il">בך</span>, <em>by</em>, or <em>with thee</em>, contrary to the <em>Targ</em>. and the Versions, which is rendered <em>in thee, i.e</em>. , Babylon; and <em>for thee </em>in the <em>Syr</em>. And this seems to be the view most consistent with the whole passage, especially <span class="bvs">Jer_51:24</span>. Babylon was the “hammer” which God had employed, “<span class="bvs">Jer_50:23</span>) but he would hereafter employ, as it were, a hammer, or a scatterer, in Babylon itself, — </p><p><strong>20.</strong>A scatterer (or a hammer) art thou to me, A weapon of war; But I will scatter in thee nations, And destroy in thee kingdoms; </p><p><strong>21.</strong>And I will scatter in thee the horse and its rider, And I will scatter in thee the chariot and its rider; </p><p><strong>22.</strong>And I will scatter in thee the husband and the wife, And I will scatter in thee the old and the child, And I will scatter in thee the young man and the maid; </p><p><strong>23.</strong>And I will scatter in thee the shepard and his flock, And I will scatter in thee the plougman and his team, And I will scatter in thee the governors and princes. </p><p>The comes, naturally, a summary of the whole, — </p><p><strong>24.</strong>And I will render to Babylon And to all the inhabitants of Chaldea, All the evil which they have done in Sion, Before your eyes, saith Jehova. </p><p>The in the two following verse Babylon is still addressed. </p><p>“Scatter” is according to the <em>Sept</em>. , the <em>Syr</em>. , and the <em>Targ</em>. ; “dash against one another” is the <em>Vulg</em>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
