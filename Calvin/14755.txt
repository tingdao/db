<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22</strong><em>Cast thy giving upon Jehovah. </em>The Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">יהב</span>, <em>yahab, </em>signifies <em>to give, </em>so that <span class="lang he-il">יהבע</span>, <em>yehobcha, </em>according to the ordinary rules of grammar, should be rendered <em>thy giving, </em>or <em>thy gift. </em><span class="cite-ref">(321)</span> Most interpreters read <em>thy burden, </em>but they assign no reason for this rendering. The verb <span class="lang he-il">יהב</span>, <em>yahab, </em>never denotes <em>to burden, </em>and there is no precedent which might justify us in supposing that the noun deduced from it can mean <em>a burden. </em>They have evidently felt themselves compelled to invent that meaning from the harshness and apparent absurdity of the stricter translation, <em>Cast thy gift upon Jehovah. </em>And I grant that the sentiment they would express is a pious one, that we ought to disburden ourselves before God of all the cares and troubles which oppress us. There is no other method of relieving our anxious souls, but by reposing ourselves upon the providence of the Lord. At the same time, I find no example of such a translation of the word, and adhere therefore to the other, which conveys sufficiently important instruction, provided we understand the expression <em>gift </em>or <em>giving </em>in a passive sense, as meaning all the benefits which we desire God to give us. The exhortation is to the effect that we should resign into the hands of God the care of those things which may concern our advantage. It is not enough that we make application to God for the supply of our wants. Our desires and petitions must be offered up with a due reliance upon his providence, for how many are there who pray in a clamorous spirit, and who, by the inordinate anxiety and restlessness which they evince, seem resolved to dictate terms to the Almighty. In opposition to this, David recommends it as a due part of modesty in our supplications, that we should transfer to God the care of those things which we ask, and there can be no question that the only means of checking an excessive impatience is an absolute submission to the Divine will, as to the blessings which should be bestowed. Some would explain the passage: Acknowledge the past goodness of the Lord to have been such, that you ought to hope in his kindness for the future. But this does not give the genuine meaning of the words. As to whether David must be considered as here exhorting himself or others, it is a question of little moment, though he seems evidently, in laying down a rule for his own conduct, to prescribe one at the same time to all the children of God. The words which he subjoins, <em>And he shall feed thee, </em>clearly confirm that view of the passage which I have given above. Subject as we are in this life to manifold wants, we too often yield ourselves up to disquietude and anxiety. But David assures us that God will sustain to us the part of a shepherd, assuming the entire care of our necessities, and supplying us with all that is really for our advantage. He adds, that <em>he will not suffer the righteous to fall, or always to stagger </em>If <span class="lang he-il">מוט</span>, <em>mot, </em>be understood as meaning <em>a fall, </em>then the sense will run: God shall establish the righteous that he shall never fall. But the other rendering seems preferable. We see that the righteous for a time are left to stagger, and almost to sink under the storms by which they are beset. From this distressing state David here declares, that they shall be eventually freed, and blessed with a peaceful termination of all their harassing dangers and cares. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(321)</span> “What thou desirest to have given thee,” according to the Chaldee, which renders the word <em>thy hope</em>; <em>i e</em>. , that which thou hopest to receive. On the margin of our English Bibles it is, <em>thy gift</em>, which Williams explains by “allotment.” “<em>Cast thy allotment upon the Lord</em>, ” says he, “on which we may remark, that whatever allotment we receive from God, whether of prosperity or adversity, it is our duty to refer it back to him: ‘He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord, and he will repay him;’ or if our lot be adverse, ‘he will sustain’ under every burden, and ‘never suffer the righteous to be moved’ from his foundation.” In like manner Rogers understands the word. “<em>Cast upon Jehovah what he allots you</em>; <em>i e</em>. , commit to Jehovah your destiny. Supply <span class="lang he-il">אשר</span> before <span class="lang he-il">יהבך</span> ” —<em>Book of Psalms in Hebrew</em>, volume 2, p. 210. The Septuagint reads, <span class="lang el-gr">μέριμνάν</span>,<em>thy care</em>; in which it is followed by the apostle Peter, (<span class="bvs">1Pe_5:5</span>.) The reading of the Vulgate, Syriac, Æthiopic, and Arabic versions is the same. </p></div></div>
