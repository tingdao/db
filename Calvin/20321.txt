<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet again deplores the profanation of all sacred things; and this complaint, as I have said, proceeded from the bitterest sorrow; for though it was a sad thing for the faithful, to lose all their property, to wander in exile and to suffer the want of all things, yet it must have been more grievous to them to see the Temple polluted, and all religion exposed to shame. This calamity, then, the Prophet again deplores, when he says that <em>enemies had stretched forth their hand against all desirable things</em>. Now, by desirable things, he does not mean riches, nor anything that belongs to the condition of an earthly and fading life, but those invaluable treasures which God had deposited with the chosen people. The enemy, then, had <em>extended his hand </em>against the altar, against the table, against the ark of the covenant, against all the sacred vessels. </p><p>Then this indignity was increased, <em>because </em>Jerusalem <em>saw the heathens entering into her sanctuary</em>; for the pronoun is in the feminine gender. But the sanctuary of Jerusalem was God’s Temple for, though properly speaking, it was alone God’s sanctuary, it was yet at the same time the sanctuary of the people, because God had not caused the Temple to be built for his own benefit, but rather for the benefit of his people. What God, then, had consecrated for himself is rightly called the sanctuary of the people. He still increases the indignity, because God <em>had forbidden the heathens to enter the sanctuary</em>; but they had violently rushed in there. They did not, however, enter for the sake of worshipping God, for it was his command to keep them from the holy assembly; but they had by force entered for the purpose of violating the Temple, and also of abolishing the whole worship of God, and of exposing religion to all kinds of mockery. <span class="cite-ref">(136)</span></p><p><strong>(136)</strong> The verse may be thus rendered, — </p><p>His hand has the oppressor expanded over all her desirable things; <LineBreak />Indeed she saw it: nations entered her sanctuary; <LineBreak />Though thou hast commanded this, “They shall not come to thine assembly.” </p><p>“The desirable things” were sacred things, and might be so rendered.
