<div class="comment-content"><p>Interpreters give various expositions of this verse. Some understand a soldier of light armor by <em>him who bends the bow; </em>and by him who <em>elevates himself in his coat of mail, </em>they understand a heavy-armed, soldier, There is also another difference; some take <span class="lang he-il">אל</span>, <em>al, </em>for <span class="lang he-il">לא</span>, <em>la, </em>when it is said <span class="lang he-il">ואל יתעל</span><em>, veal itol, </em>because a copulative follows; and the words seem not to be well connected, if we read thus, “As to him who raises himself up in his coat of mail, and spare ye not,” etc.; and hence they take negatively the particle <span class="lang he-il">אל</span>, <em>al, </em>instead of <span class="lang he-il">לא</span><em>la</em>, “and he may not raise up himself in his coat of mail.” But it is probable that the copulative in the second place is redundant The simple meaning would therefore be, <em>As to him who bends the bow, and who raises himself up in his coat of mall </em><span class="cite-ref">(81)</span></p><p>I do not, indeed, give such a refined interpretation as some do, respecting the light and heavy armed soldiers. I doubt not, then, but that he points out the archers, and those clad in mail. If, however, any one prefers the other explanation, let him enjoy his own opinion. As to the main point, it is evident that the Prophet exhorts the Persians and the Medes not to spare the young men among the Chaldeans, but to destroy their whole army, so that no part of it should be left remaining. </p><p><strong>(81)</strong> It is singular that <span class="lang he-il">אל</span> is omitted in the <em>Sept. </em>and the <em>Syr., </em>and retained in its negative sense in the <em>Vulg. </em>and the <em>Targ., </em>which makes no sense consistently with the context. There is evidently <span class="lang he-il">אשר</span> understood before the first verb, as is often the case when the verb is in the future tense. Then the literal rendering would be this, — </p><p>At him who bends let the bender bend his bow, And at him who glories in his coat of mail; And spare ye not her chosen men, Utterly destroy all her host. </p><p>There is here perfect consistency. They who take <span class="lang he-il">אל</span> as a negative say, that the first part is addressed to the Chaldeans, and the second to their enemies; but this would be strangely abrupt. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
