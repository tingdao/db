<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>148.</strong><em>My eyes have prevented the night watchers. </em><span class="cite-ref">(21)</span> The Psalmist here intimates, that he was more sedulously intent on meditating upon the law of God than watchmen of the night were to keep watch. Others are of opinion, that the verb <span class="lang he-il">שוח</span>, <em>suach, </em>is put for <em>to discourse. </em>If this opinion is admitted, the sense will be, that the Prophet, not from ostentation, but for the welfare of his brethren, was so desirous of communicating instruction, that he gave himself no rest. The word <em>meditate </em>is, however, more appropriate in this place; for the night is an unseasonable time for discoursing upon the law of God; but at that season, when alone, he silently recalled to his memory what he had previously learned, so that he passed no part of the night without meditating upon the law. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(21)</span> The Hebrews divided the natural day into three portions--morning, noon, and evening — which are mentioned by David as seasons in which he engaged in prayer. (<span class="bvs">Psa_55:17</span>.) They also divided the night into three parts, called “watches,” consisting of four hours each, and commencing at our six o’clock in the evening. In <span class="bvs">Lam_2:19</span>, we read of the first watch; or, as it is there designated, “the beginning of the watches;” in <span class="bvs">Jud_7:19</span>, of “the middle watch;” and in <span class="bvs">Exo_14:24</span>, of “the morning watch.” A similar division of the night seems to have been made by other ancient nations, as appears from the references made to it by Homer and the early Greek writers. The Greeks and Romans, however, in improving their military discipline, afterwards divided the night into four watches, each consisting of three hours; and when the Jews fell under the dominion of the latter people, they adopted from them this division of the night. Hence we read of “the fourth watch of the night” in <span class="bvs">Mat_14:25</span>. And the four watches are mentioned together in <span class="bvs">Mar_13:35</span> : </p><p>“Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at cock-crowing, <LineBreak />or in the morning.” </p><p>The time at which each of these four watches began and ended is thus determined by Dr. Hales, who has written elaborately on the subject: “1. <span class="lang el-gr">Οψε</span>, <em>the late, </em>began at sunset, and ended with the third hour of the night, including the evening-dawn, or twilight. It was also called <span class="lang el-gr">οψια ὡρα</span>, <em>eventide, </em><span class="bvs">Mar_11:11</span>; or simply <span class="lang el-gr">οψια</span>, <em>evening</em>, <span class="bvs">Joh_20:19</span>, etc. 2. <span class="lang el-gr">Μεσονυκτιον</span>, <em>the midnight, </em>lasted from the third hour till midnight. 3. <span class="lang el-gr">Αλεκτοροφωνια</span>, <em>the cock-crowing, </em>midnight till the third hour after, or the ninth hour of the night. It included the two cock-crowings, with the second or principal of which it ended. 4. <span class="lang el-gr">Πρωι</span>, <em>the early, </em>lasted from the ninth to the twelfth hor of the night, or sunrise, including the morning-dawn or twilight. It is also called <span class="lang el-gr">πρωια</span>, <em>morning, or morningtide, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">ὡρα</span> being understood,) <span class="bvs">Joh_18:28</span>, etc. </p><p>“When the Psalmist here declares, that his eyes prevented the nightwatches, we are to understand him as chiefly referring to the middle and morning watches, which falling at that period of the night when men in general are devoted to rest, envinced the strength, fervour, and self-sacrificing character of his devotions.” — <em>Dr. Morison. </em></p></div></div>
