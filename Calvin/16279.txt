<div class="comment-content"><p>In the second verse the allusion is evidently to the legal ceremonies. <span class="cite-ref">(235)</span> At that time the prayers of God’s people were according to his own appointment sanctified through the offering up of incense and sacrifices, and David depended upon this promise. <span class="cite-ref">(236)</span> As to the conjecture some have made, that he was at this time an exile, and cut off from the privileges of the religious assembly, nothing certain can be said upon that point; their idea being that there is a tacit antithesis in the verse — that though prevented from continuing with God’s worshippers into the sanctuary, or using incense and sacrifice, he desired God would accept his prayers notwithstanding. But as there seems no reason to adopt this restricted sense, it is enough to understand the general truth, that as these symbols taught the Lord’s people to consider their prayers equally acceptable to God with the sweetest incense, and most excellent sacrifice, David derived confirmation to his faith from the circumstance. Although the view of the fathers was not confined entirely to the external ceremonies, David was bound to avail himself of such helps. As he considered, therefore, that it was not in vain the incense was burned daily on the altar by God’s commandment, and the evening offering presented, he speaks of his prayers in connection with this ceremonial worship. <em>The lifting up of the hands, </em>evidently means prayer, for those who translate <span class="lang he-il">משאת</span>, <em>masath</em>, <em>a gift</em>, obscure and pervert the meaning of the Psalmist. As the word, which is derived from <span class="lang he-il">נשא</span>, <em>nasa</em>, means<em>lifting up </em>in the Hebrew, the natural inference is, that prayer is meant, in allusion to the outward action practiced in it. And we can easily suppose that David here as elsewhere repeats the same thing twice. As to the reason which has led to the universal practice amongst all nations of lifting up the hand in prayer, I have taken notice of it elsewhere. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(235)</span> The allusion, according to the opinion of most commentators, is to the morning and evening sacrifices, of which see an account in <span class="bvs">Exo_29:38</span>. In the phraseology of the verse it is supposed that there is a reference to the commencing and concluding acts of the daily public worship among the Jews. Every morning and evening the priests offered incense upon the incense-altar which stood in the holy place, while the people prayed without. But in the morning the incense was offered <em>before </em>the sacrifice was laid upon the altar of burnt-offering; whereas in the evening (at the ninth hour) it was offered after the sacrifice was laid upon the altar; and thus in the evening the sacrifice and the incense were offered at the same time. See Lightfoot’s Temple Service, chapter 9: section 5. Dr. Adam Clarke, however, thinks that David does not refer to any <em>sacrifice</em>; “for,” says he, “he uses not <span class="lang he-il">זבח</span>, <em>zebach</em>, which is almost universally used for a <em>slaughtered animal</em>, <span class="lang he-il">מנחת</span>, <em>minchath</em>, which is generally taken for a <em>gratitude offering</em>, or an <em>unbloody </em>sacrifice.” He translates the last two words “the evening oblation.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(236)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car pource que lors Dieu vouloit que les prieres des fideles fussent sanctifiees par encensement et par sacrifices, David s’appuye sur ceste promesse</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
