<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22</strong><em>Bless Jehovah, all ye his works </em>The Psalmist in conclusion addresses all creatures; for although they may be without speech and understanding, yet they ought in a manner to re-echo the praises of their Creator. This he does on our account, that we may learn that there is not a corner in heaven or on earth where God is not praised. We have less excuse, if, when all the works of God by praising their Maker reproach us for our sloth we do not at least follow their example. The express mention of <em>all places of his dominion, </em>seems to be intended to stir up the faithful to greater ardor in this exercise; for if even those countries where his voice is unheard ought not to be mute in his praise, how can we lawfully remain silent to whom he opens his mouth, anticipating us by his own sacred voice? In short, David shows that his design in recounting Godâ€™s benefits, and magnifying the extent of his empire, was to animate himself the more to the exercise of praising him. </p></div>
