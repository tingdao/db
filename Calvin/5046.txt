<div class="comment-content"><p>God had destined, as we have before seen, <span class="cite-ref">(221)</span> six cities for refuge, in case any one had killed a man, provided he could prove his innocence before the judges. As to the three which He had appointed on the other side of Jordan, Moses records that he had faithfully performed what God had commanded. Hence it appears that, although he could not immediately comply with God’s command to its full extent, still he did not wait until the three other cities could be added; but that, as far as circumstances permitted, he discharged his duty. Hence let us learn that, even when we cannot at once entirely carry out what God commands us to do, we are still to be by no means idle. For nothing but sheer laziness stands in our way, unless we speedily commence at God’s command what it is His will to finish and accomplish by the hands of others. </p><p><strong>(221)</strong> See <em>ante, </em>on <span class="bvs">Num_35:10</span>; vol. 3, pp. 62,<em>et seq. </em></p></div>
