<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>44.</strong><em>It is sown an animal body. </em>As he could not express <em>each </em>particular by enumerating one by one, he sums up all <em>comprehensively </em>in one word, by saying that the body is now <em>animal, </em><span class="cite-ref">(108)</span> but it will then be <em>spiritual. </em>Now that is called <em>animal </em>which is quickened by <em>( </em><em>anima </em><em>) </em>the soul: that is <em>spiritual </em>which is quickened by the <em>Spirit. </em><span class="cite-ref">(109)</span> Now it is the soul that quickens the body, so as to keep it from being a dead carcase. Hence it takes its title very properly from it. After the resurrection, on the other hand, that quickening influence, which it will receive from the Spirit, will be more excellent. <span class="cite-ref">(110)</span> Let us, however, always bear in mind, what we have seen previously — that the substance of the body is the same, <span class="cite-ref">(111)</span> and that it is the quality only that is here treated of. Let the present quality of the body be called, for the sake of greater plainness, <em>animation; </em><span class="cite-ref">(112)</span> let the future receive the name of <em>inspiration. </em>For as to the soul’s now <em>quickening </em>the body, that is effected through the intervention of many helps; for we stand in need of drink, food, clothing, sleep, and other things of a similar nature. Hence the weakness of <em>animation </em>is clearly manifested. The energy of the Spirit, on the other hand, for <em>quickening, </em>will be much more complete, and, consequently, exempted from necessities of that nature. This is the simple and genuine meaning of the Apostle; that no one may, by philosophizing farther, indulge in airy speculations, as those do, who suppose that the substance of the body will be spiritual, while there is no mention made here of substance, and no change will be made upon it. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(108)</span> “<em>It </em>is generally agreed on by the best expositors, that <span class="lang el-gr">ψυχικὸς</span> here, as being opposed to <span class="lang el-gr">πευματικὸς</span><em>, (spiritual,) </em>especially as the expression is used with a reference to the words of Moses respecting the body of Adam, <span class="lang el-gr">ἐγένετο εἰς ψυχὴν ζῶσαν </span><em>(became a living soul,) </em>must signify <em>animal, </em>(literally that which draws in the breath of life, necessary to the existence of all animal bodies,) that which is endowed with faculties of sense, and has need of food, drink, and sleep for its <em>support.” </em>— <em>Bloomfield. </em>“<span class="lang el-gr">Ψυχικὸν </span> not <span class="lang el-gr">φυσικὸν</span>.
