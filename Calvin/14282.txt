<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>O Jehovah! I have loved, etc </em>In this verse he confirms what he had said before, that he came not into the sanctuary in a careless manner, but with serious devotion. Irreligious men, although they often resort to the sacred assemblies, frequent them merely as lurking places, where they may escape the eye of God. On the contrary, the truly pious and pure in heart resort to them, not for the sake of vain ostentation, but as they are sincerely bent on seeking God, they willingly and affectionately employ the helps which he there affords them; and the advantage which they derive from them creates love to them in their hearts, and longings after them. This declaration farther shows, that however David excelled others in faith, yet he was not without fear lest the violence of his enemies might deprive him of the ordinary means of instruction which God had conferred on his Church. He felt his need of the Church’s common discipline and order, and he therefore anxiously labored to retain his enjoyment of them. From this we infer the impious pride of those who look with contempt on the services of religion as unnecessary, although David himself could not live without them. Another consideration, indeed, existed in those days, I confess, while the law, like a schoolmaster, held the ancient people in a state of servitude compared with ours. Our case, however, is one with theirs in this respect, that the weakness of our faith requires help as well as theirs. And as God for this purpose has appointed the sacraments, as well as the whole order of the Church, woe to the pride of those who recklessly desert the services which we perceive to have been held in such high esteem by the pious servants of God. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">מעון</span>, <em>me-on, </em>according to some, is derived from a word <span class="cite-ref">(575)</span> which signifies <em>an eye; </em>and they translate it <em>comeliness, </em>or <em>appearance. </em>This is the translation of the Septuagint. <span class="cite-ref">(576)</span> But as the word is almost every where used to signify <em>a dwelling-place, </em>which is more simple, I prefer to retain it. The sanctuary is called <em>God’s house, </em>and <em>the dwelling-place of his glory; </em>and we know how frequently expressions of this kind are employed in Scripture to bear testimony to the presence of God. Not that God either dwelt in a tent, or wished to confine the minds of his people to earthly symbols; but it was needful to remind the faithful of God’s present goodness, that they might not think they sought him in vain, as we have elsewhere already said. Now, that God’s glory may dwell among us, it is necessary that a lively image of it should shine forth in word and sacraments. From this it follows, that the temples which are reckoned such among Papists are only filthy brothels of Satan. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(575)</span> Namely <span class="lang he-il">עיך</span>, <em>ayin. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(576)</span> The word which it employs is <span class="lang el-gr">ἐυπρέρπεια</span></p></div></div>
