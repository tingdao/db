<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>I knew a man in Christ </em>As he was desirous to restrain himself within bounds, he merely singles out <em>one </em>instance, and that, too, he handles in such a way as to show, that it is not from inclination that he brings it forward; for why does he speak in the person of another rather than in his own? It is as though he had said, “I should have preferred to be silent, I should have preferred to keep the whole matter suppressed within my own mind, but those persons <span class="cite-ref">(880)</span> will not allow me. I shall mention it, therefore, as it were in a stammering way, that it may be seen that I speak through constraint.” Some think that the clause <em>in Christ </em>is introduced for the purpose of confirming what he says. I view it rather as referring to the disposition, so as to intimate that Paul has not here an eye to himself, but looks to Christ exclusively. </p><p>When he confesses, that he does not know whether he was <em>in the body, </em>or <em>out of the body, </em>he expresses thereby the more distinctly the greatness of the revelation. For he means, that God dealt with him in such a way, <span class="cite-ref">(881)</span> that he did not himself understand the manner of it. Nor should this appear to us incredible, inasmuch as he sometimes manifests himself to us in such a way, that the manner of his doing so is, nevertheless, hid from our view. <span class="cite-ref">(882)</span> At the same time, this does not, in any degree, detract from the assurance of faith, which rests simply on this single point — that we are aware that God speaks to us. Nay more, let us learn from this, that we must seek the knowledge of those things only that are necessary to be known, and leave other things to God. (<span class="bvs">Deu_29:29</span>.) He says, then, that he does not know, whether he was wholly taken up — soul and body — into heaven, or whether it was his soul only, that was <em>caught up </em></p><p><em>Fourteen years ago </em>Some <span class="cite-ref">(883)</span> enquire, also, as to the place, but it does not belong to us to satisfy their curiosity. <span class="cite-ref">(884)</span> The Lord manifested himself to Paul in the beginning by a vision, when he designed to convert him from Judaism to the faith of the gospel, but he was not then admitted as yet into those secrets, as he needed even to be instructed by Ananias in the first rudiments. <span class="cite-ref">(885)</span> (<span class="bvs">Act_9:12</span>.) That vision, therefore, was nothing but a preparation, with the view of rendering him teachable. It may be, that, in this instance, he refers to that vision, of which he makes mention also, according to Luke’s narrative. (<span class="bvs">Act_22:17</span>.) There is no occasion, however, for our giving ourselves much trouble as to these conjectures, as we see that Paul himself kept silence respecting it for fourteen years, <span class="cite-ref">(886)</span> and would not have said one word in reference to it, had not the unreasonableness of malignant persons constrained him. </p><p><em>Even to the third heaven. </em>He does not here distinguish between the different heavens in the manner of the philosophers, so as to assign to each planet its own heaven. On the other hand, the number <em>three </em>is made use of (<span class="lang el-gr">κατ ἐζοχὴν)</span><em>by way of eminence, </em>to denote what is highest and most complete. Nay more, the term <em>heaven, </em>taken by itself, denotes here the blessed and glorious kingdom of God, which is above all the spheres, <span class="cite-ref">(887)</span> and the firmament itself, and even the entire frame-work of the world. Paul, however, not contenting himself with the simple term, <span class="cite-ref">(888)</span> adds, that he had reached even the greatest height, and the innermost <em>recesses. </em>For our faith scales heaven and enters it, and those that are superior to others in knowledge get higher in degree and elevation, but to reach the <em>third heavens </em>has been granted to very few. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(880)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Ces opiniastres ambitieux</span>;” — “Those ambitious, obstinate persons.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(881)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Que Dieu a tellement besongne et precede enuers luy</span>;” — That God had in such a manner wrought and acted towards him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(882)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Est incomprehensible a nostre sens</span>;” — “Is incomprehensible to our mind.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(883)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Ne se contentans point de ceci</span>;” — “Not contenting themselves with this.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(884)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Mais nous n’auons point delibere, et aussi il n’est pas en nous de satisfaire a leur curiosite</span>;” — “But we have not determined as to this, and it does not belong to us to satisfy their curiosity.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(885)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Es premiers commencemens de la religion</span>;” — “In the first elements of religion.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(886)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>This vision Paul had kept secret for fourteen years.

It was only when he was <em>compelled </em>to refer to the evidences of his apostolic mission that he refers to it here.” — <em>Barnes. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(887)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Par dessus tons les cieux</span>;” — “Above all the heavens.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(888)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Non content de nommer simplement le ciel</span>;” — “Not contented with simply employing the term <em>heaven. </em>” </p></div></div>
