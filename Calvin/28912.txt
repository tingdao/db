<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Be not yoked </em>As if regaining his authority, he now reproves them more freely, because they associated with unbelievers, as partakers with them in outward idolatry. For he has exhorted them to show themselves docile to him as to a father: he now, in accordance with the rights that belong to him, <span class="cite-ref">(608)</span> reproves the fault into which they had fallen. Now we mentioned in the former epistle <span class="cite-ref">(609)</span> what this fault was; for, as they imagined that there was nothing that was unlawful for them in outward things, they defiled themselves with wicked superstitions without any reserve. For in frequenting the banquets of unbelievers, they participated along with them in profane and impure rites, and while they sinned grievously, they nevertheless thought themselves innocent. On this account Paul inveighs here against outward idolatry, and exhorts Christians to stand aloof from it, and have no connection with it. He begins, however, with a general statement, with the view of coming down from that to a particular instance, for to be <em>yoked with unbelievers </em>means nothing less than to </p><p>have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Eph_5:11</span>,) </p><p>and to hold out the hand to them <span class="cite-ref">(610)</span> in token of agreement. </p><p>Many are of opinion that he speaks of marriage, but the context clearly shows that they are mistaken. The word that Paul makes use of means — to be connected together in drawing the same yoke. It is a metaphor taken from oxen or horses, which require to walk at the same pace, and to act together in the same work, when fastened under one yoke. <span class="cite-ref">(611)</span> When, therefore, he prohibits us from having partnership with unbelievers in drawing the same yoke, he means simply this, that we should have no fellowship with them in their pollutions. For <em>one </em>sun shines upon us, we eat of the same bread, we breathe the same air, and we cannot altogether refrain from intercourse with them; but Paul speaks of the yoke of impiety, that is, of participation in works, in which Christians cannot lawfully have fellowship. On this principle marriage will also be prohibited, inasmuch as it is a snare, by which both men and women are entangled into an agreement with impiety; but what I mean is simply this, that Paul’s doctrine is of too general a nature to be restricted to marriage exclusively, for he is discoursing here as to the shunning of idolatry, on which account, also, we are prohibited from contracting marriages with the wicked. </p><p><em>For what fellowship </em>He confirms his exhortation on the ground of its being an absurd, and, as it were, monstrous connecting together of things in themselves much at variance; for these things can no more coalesce than fire and water. In short it comes to this, that unless they would have everything thrown into confusion, they must refrain from the pollutions of the wicked. Hence, too, we infer, that even those that do not in their hearts approve of superstitions are, nevertheless, polluted by dissimulation if they do not openly and ingenuously stand aloof from them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(608)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Parlant comme en puissance et authorite de pere</span>;” — “Speaking as with the power and authority of a father.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(609)</span> See vol. 1, p. 282. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(610)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Aux infideles</span>;” — “To unbelievers.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(611)</span> “<em>Joachim Camerarius</em>, in his Commentary on the New Testament, (Cambridge 1642,) suggests, that <span class="lang el-gr">ἐτεροζυγοῦντες</span>, may have a reference to a <em>balance</em>, and that Paul — would not have the Corinthians <em>unequally balanced </em>with unbelievers.
