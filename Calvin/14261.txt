<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>He will guide the poor in judgment. </em>The Psalmist here specifies the second manifestation of his grace which God makes towards those who, being subdued by his power, and brought under his yoke, bear it willingly, and submit themselves to his government. But never will this docility be found in any man, until the heart, which is naturally elated and filled with pride, has been humbled and subdued. As the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">ענוים</span>, <em>anavim, </em>denotes the <em>poor </em>or <em>afflicted, </em>and is employed in a metaphorical sense, to denote <em>the meek and humble, </em>it is probable that David, under this term, includes the afflictions which serve to restrain and subdue the frowardness of the flesh, as well as the grace of humility itself; as if he had said, When God has first humbled them, then he kindly stretches forth his hand to them, and leads and guides them throughout the whole course of their life. Moreover, some understand these terms,<em>judgment </em>and <em>way of the Lord, </em>as denoting a righteous and well ordered manner of life. Others refer them to the providence of God, an interpretation which seems more correct, and more agreeable to the context, for it is immediately added, <em>All the ways of Jehovah are mercy and truth. </em>The meaning therefore is, that those who are truly humbled in their hearts, and brought to place their confidence in God, shall experience how much care he has for his children, <span class="cite-ref">(558)</span> and how well he provides for their necessities. The terms, <em>judgment </em>and <em>way of the Lord, </em>therefore, are simply of the same import in this place as his government, in the exercise of which he shows that he, as a kind father, has a special interest in the welfare of his children, by relieving them when they are oppressed, raising them up when cast down, cheering and comforting them when sorrowful, and succouring them when afflicted. We perceive, then, by what order God proceeds in the manifestation of his grace towards us. First, he brings us again into the way when we are wandering and going astray from him, or rather, when we are already fugitives and exiles from him, he restrains our frowardness; and whereas we were before froward and rebellious, he now subdues us to the obedience of his righteousness: and, secondly, after he has afflicted and tried us, he does not forsake us; but after he has moulded and trained us by the cross to humility and meekness, he still shows himself to be a wise and provident father in guiding and directing us through life. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(558)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quel soin il ha de ses enfans</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
