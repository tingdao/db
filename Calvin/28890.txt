<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Whether we are beside ourselves. </em>This is said by way of concession; for Paul’s glorying was sane, or it was, if we may so term it, a sober and most judicious madness; <span class="cite-ref">(542)</span> but as he appeared foolish in the eyes of many, he speaks according to their views. Now he declares two things: in the <em>first </em>place, that he makes no account of himself, but has this one object in view — that he may serve God and the Church; and, <em>secondly, </em>that he fears not the opinion of men, so that he is prepared for being reckoned either sane or insane, provided only he transacts faithfully the affairs of God and the Church. The meaning, therefore, is this: “As to my making mention so frequently of my integrity, persons will take this as they choose. It is not, however, for my own sake that I do it, but, on the contrary, I have God and the Church exclusively in view. Hence I am prepared to be silent and to speak, according as the glory of God and the advantage of the Church will require, and I shall be quite contented that the world reckon me <em>beside myself, </em>provided only it is not to myself, but to God, that I am <em>beside myself. </em>” <span class="cite-ref">(543)</span> This is a passage that is deserving not merely of notice, but also of constant meditation; for unless we shall have our minds thus regulated, the smallest occasions of offense will from time to time draw us off from our duty. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(542)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estoit bonne, et procedoit d’vn esprit prudent: ou si ainsi faut parler, sa folie estoit d’vn sens rassis, et pleine de sagesse</span>;” — “Was good, or proceeded from a prudent mind; or, if we may speak so, his folly was from a settled judgment, and full of wisdom.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(543)</span> “The Apostle, in these words — </p><p>For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God, or whether we be sober, it is for your cause, (<span class="bvs">2Co_6:13</span>,) </p><p>defends his speaking so much of his integrity. Though some men would count him out of his wits for it, yet he regards not their judgment; for if he were in an ecstasy, or beside himself, his purpose was to serve God and his Church, and therefore he did not regard the opinion of men, whether he were accounted mad or sober, so he might perform the end of his Apostleship. The sense, therefore, of it, as Calvin renders it, is this — ’Let men take it as they will, that I speak so much of my integrity, I do it not upon my own account, but have respect to God and the Church in speaking of it; for I am as ready to be silent as to speak, when my silence may glorify God and advantage the Church as much as my speech.’” — <em>Charnock’s Works</em>, (Lond. 1684,) volume 2, p. 65. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
