<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>I have called upon thee, etc. </em>This verb being put in the past tense denotes a continued act; and, therefore, it includes the present time. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, <em>ki</em>, which we translate <em>surely, </em>often signifies <em>because, </em>and if it is so understood in this passage, the meaning will be, that David took encouragement to pray, because, depending upon the promise of God, he hoped that his prayers would not be in vain. But, perhaps, it may be thought preferable to change the tense of the verb as some do, so as to give this meaning, I will pray, because I have hitherto experienced that thou hast heard <span class="cite-ref">(358)</span> my prayers. I have, however, chosen the exposition what appears to me the more simple. David, in my judgment, here encourages and animates himself to call upon God, from the confident hope of being heard, as if he had said, Since I call upon thee, surely, O God, thou wilt not despise my prayers. Immediately after he beseeches God to bestow upon him the blessings of which he told us he entertained an assured hope. </p><p><strong>(358)</strong> The Septuagint renders the verb in the past tense, “<span class="lang el-gr">Επηκουσας μου</span>,” “Thou hast heard me.” The Syriac and Vulgate give a similar rendering. The verb, in the Hebrew, is in the future; but it is a common thing in Hebrew to use the future tense for the past. </p></div>
