<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And Joseph brought them out</em>. Moses explains more fully what he had touched upon in a single word. Joseph brings forth his sons from his own lap to his fatherâ€™s knees, not only for the sake of honor, but that he may present them to receive a blessing from the prophet of God; for he was certainly persuaded, that holy Jacob did not desire to embrace his grandsons after the common manner of men; but inasmuch as he was the interpreter of God, he wished to impart to them the blessing deposited with himself. And although, in dividing the land of Canaan, he assigned them equal portions with his sons, yet the imposition of his hands had respect to something higher; namely, that they should be two of the patriarchs of the Church, and should hold an honorable preeminence in the spiritual kingdom of God. </p></div>
