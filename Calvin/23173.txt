<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Herod the king was troubled </em>Herod was not unacquainted with the predictions, which promised to the Jews a King, who would restore their distressful and ruinous affairs to a prosperous condition. He had lived from a child among that nation, and was thoroughly acquainted with their affairs. Besides, the report was spread everywhere, and could not be unknown to the neighboring nations. Yet he is <em>troubled, </em>as if the matter had been new and unheard of; because he put no trust in God, and thought it idle to rely on the promises of a Redeemer; and particularly because, with the foolish confidence incident to proud men, he imagined that the kingdom was secure to himself and his descendants. But though, in the intoxication of prosperity, he was formerly accustomed to view the prophecies with scorn, the recollection of them now aroused him to sudden alarm. For he would not have been so strongly moved by the simple tale of the <em>Magi, </em>if he had not remembered the predictions, which he had formerly looked upon as harmless, <span class="cite-ref">(182)</span> and of no importance. Thus, when the Lord has permitted unbelievers to sleep, he suddenly breaks their rest. <span class="cite-ref">(183)</span></p><p><em>And all Jerusalem with him </em>This may be explained in two ways. Either the people were roused, in a tumultuous manner, by the novelty of the occurrence, though the glad tidings of a king who had been born to them were cordially welcomed. Or the people, accustomed to distresses, and rendered callous by long endurance, dreaded a change which might introduce still greater calamities. For they were so completely worn down, and almost wasted, by continued wars, that their wretched and cruel bondage appeared to them not only tolerable, but desirable, provided it were accompanied by peace. This shows how little they had profited under God’s chastisements: for they were so benumbed and stupified, that the promised redemption and salvation almost stank <span class="cite-ref">(184)</span> in their nostrils. Matthew intended, I have no doubt, to express their ingratitude, in being so entirely broken by the long continuance of their afflictions, as to throw away the hope and desire of the grace which had been promised to them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(182)</span> “Lusoria;” alluding to the phrase used by Seneca and others, <em>lusoria fulmina </em><em>, </em>“harmless thunderbolts.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(183)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il les resveille tout soudain, et leur fait bien sentir leur folie</span>.” — “He awakes them all on a sudden, and makes them deeply feel their folly.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(184)</span> “Quodammodo foeteret,” </p></div></div>
