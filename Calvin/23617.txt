<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>He blessed. </em>In this passage, as in many others, <em>blessing </em>denotes thanksgiving. Now Christ has taught us, by his example, that we cannot partake of our food with holiness and purity, unless we express our gratitude to God, from whose hand it comes to us. Accordingly, Paul tells us, that every kind of food which God bestows upon us is <em>sanctifed by the word of God and prayer, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Ti_4:5</span>;) by which he means, that brutal men, who do not regard by faith the blessing of God, and do not offer to him thanksgiving, corrupt and pollute by the filth of their unbelief all that is by nature pure; and, on the other hand, that they are corrupted and defiled by the food which they swallow, because to unbelievers nothing is clean. Christ has therefore laid down for his followers the proper manner of taking food, that they may not profane their own persons and the gifts of God by wicked sacrilege. </p><p><em>Raising his eyes towards heaven. </em>This expresses warm and earnest supplication. Not that such an attitude is at all times necessary when we pray, but because the Son of God did not choose to disregard the outward forms which are fitted to aid human weakness. It ought also to be taken into account, that <em>to raise the eyes </em>upwards is an excitement well fitted to arouse us from sloth, when our minds are too strongly fixed on the earth. </p></div>
