<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>And every one who believes in him shall not be ashamed. </em>He subjoins this testimony from another part for the consolation of the godly; as though he had said, “Because Christ is called the stone of stumbling, there is no reason that we should dread him, or entertain fear instead of confidence; for he is appointed for ruin to the unbelieving, but for life and resurrection to the godly.” As then the former prophecy, concerning the stumbling and offence, is fulfilled in the rebellious and unbelieving, so there is another which is intended for the godly, and that is, that he is a firm stone, precious, a corner-stone, most firmly fixed, and whosoever builds on it shall never fall. By putting <em>shall not be ashamed </em>instead of s<em>hall not hasten </em>or fall, he has followed the Greek Translator. It is indeed certain that the Lord in that passage intended to strengthen the hope of His people: and when the Lord bids us to entertain good hope, it hence follows that we cannot be ashamed. <span class="cite-ref">(317)</span> See a passage like this in <span class="bvs">1Pe_2:10</span></p><p><strong>(317)</strong> The citation in this verse is made in a remarkable manner. The first part, “Behold I lay in Zion,” is taken from <span class="bvs">Isa_28:16</span>; what follows, “a stone of stumbling and rock of offense,” is taken from <span class="bvs">Isa_8:14</span>; and then the last words, “and whosoever believes in him shall not be ashamed,” are given from the preceding passage in <span class="bvs">Isa_28:16</span>. The subject is the same. </p><p>With respect to the last clause Paul has followed the <em>Septuagint</em>, “shall not be ashamed.” But the Hebrew word, rendered in our version “shall not make haste,” will bear a similar meaning, and may be translated, shall not hurry or be confounded. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
