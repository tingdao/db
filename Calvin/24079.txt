<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>The Son of man indeed goeth. </em>Here Christ meets an offense, which might otherwise have greatly shaken pious minds. For what could be more unreasonable than that the Son of God should be infamously betrayed by a disciple, and abandoned to the rage of enemies, in order to be dragged to an ignominious death? But Christ declares that all this takes place only by the will of God; and he proves this decree by the testimony of Scripture, because God formerly revealed, by the mouth of his Prophet, what he had determined. </p><p>We now perceive what is intended by the words of Christ. It was, that the disciples, knowing that what was done was regulated by the providence of God, might not imagine that his life or death was determined by chance. But the usefulness of this doctrine extends much farther; for never are we fully confirmed in the result of the death of Christ, till we are convinced that he was not accidentally dragged by men to the cross, but that the sacrifice had been appointed by an eternal decree of God for expiating the sins of the world. For whence do we obtain reconciliation, but because Christ has appeased the Father by his obedience? Wherefore let us always place before our minds the providence of God, which Judas himself, and all wicked men — though it is contrary to their wish, and though they have another end in view — are compelled to obey. Let us always hold this to be a fixed principle, that Christ suffered, because it pleased God to have such an expiation. </p><p>And yet Christ does not affirm that Judas was freed from blame, on the ground that he did nothing but what God had appointed. For though God, by his righteous judgment, appointed for the price of our redemption the death of his Son, yet nevertheless, Judas, in betraying Christ, brought upon himself righteous condemnation, because he was full of treachery and avarice. In short, God’s determination that the world should be redeemed, does not at all interfere with Judas being a wicked traitor. Hence we perceive, that though men can do nothing but what God has appointed, still this does not free them from condemnation, when they are led by a wicked desire to sin. For though God directs them, by an unseen bridle, to an end which is unknown to them, nothing is farther from their intention than to obey his decrees. Those two principles, no doubt, appear to human reason Lo be inconsistent with each other, that God regulates the affairs of men by his Providence in such a manner, that nothing is done but by his will and command, and yet he damns the reprobate, by whom he has carried into execution what he intended. But we see how Christ, in this passage, reconciles both, by pronouncing a curse on Judas, though what he contrived against God had been appointed by God; not that Judas’s act of betraying ought strictly to be called the work of God, but because God turned the treachery of Judas so as to accomplish His own purpose. </p><p>I am aware of the manner in which some commentators endeavor to avoid this rock. They acknowledge that what had been written was accomplished through the agency of Judas, because God testified by predictions what He fore-knew. By way of softening the doctrine, which appears to them to be somewhat harsh, they substitute the <em>foreknowledge </em>of God in place of the <em>decree, </em>as if God merely beheld from a distance future events, and did not arrange them according to his pleasure. But very differently does the Spirit settle this question; for not only does he assign as the reason why Christ was delivered up, that <em>it was so written, </em>but also that it was so <em>determined. </em>For where Matthew and Mark quote Scripture, Luke leads us direct to the heavenly decree, saying, <em>according to what was determined; </em>as also in the Acts of the Apostles, he shows that Christ <em>was delivered </em>not only <em>by the foreknowledge, </em>but likewise <em>by the fixed purpose of God, </em>(<span class="bvs">Act_2:25</span>) and a little afterwards, that <em>Herod and Pilate, </em>with other wicked men, </p><p>did those things which had been fore-ordained by the hand and purpose of God, (<span class="bvs">Act_4:27</span>.) </p><p>Hence it is evident that it is but an ignorant subterfuge which is employed by those who betake themselves to bare foreknowledge. </p><p><em>It had been good for that man. </em>By this expression we are taught what a dreadful vengeance awaits the wicked, for whom <em>it would have been better that they had never been born. </em>And yet this life, though transitory, and full of innumerable distresses, is an invaluable gift of God. Again, we also infer from it, how detestable is their wickedness, which not only extinguishes the precious gifts of God, and turns them to their destruction, but makes it to have been <em>better for them </em>that they had never tasted the goodness of God. But this phrase is worthy of observation, <em>it would have been good for that man if he had never been born; </em>for though the condition of Judas was wretched, yet to have created hint was good in God, who, appointing the reprobate to the day of destruction, illustrates also in this way his own glory, as Solomon tells us: </p><p>The Lord hath made all things for himself; yea, <LineBreak />even the wicked for the day of evil, (<span class="bvs">Pro_16:4</span>.) </p><p>The secret government of God, which provides even the schemes and works of men, is thus vindicated, as I lately noticed, from all blame and suspicion. </p></div>
