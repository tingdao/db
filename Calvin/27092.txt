The apostles were able so to overcome their enemies, that they should not have had one word to say; but their fury was so untamed, and unbridled that they do rather go mad. Yet we must therewithal note the force of the word, because although the reprobate are not thereby changed, that they may become better, yet it pierceth into their hearts, so that it urgeth their consciences; for thence springeth their fury, because they saw themselves <span class="cite-ref">(281)</span> urged by their judge. They would gladly mock all the gospel, as they attempt whatsoever they can, that they may count it as nothing; but there is in the same a certain hidden majesty, which driveth away mightily all their delicacy. <span class="cite-ref">(282)</span> And chiefly when they are cited by the sound of the trumpet to appear before the judgment-seat of God, then appeareth their madness and fury. </p><p><strong>(280)</strong> “Sed rumpuntur,” but they burst (with rage.) </p><p><strong>(281)</strong> “Se sentiunt,” they feel themselves. </p><p><strong>(282)</strong> “Quae omnes illorum delicias violenter discutit,” which, with a strong hand, dispels all their delights. </p></div>
