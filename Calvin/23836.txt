<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Hosanna to the Son of David. </em>This prayer is taken from <span class="bvs">Psa_118:25</span>. Matthew relates expressly the Hebrew words, in order to inform us, that these applauses were not rashly bestowed on Christ, and that the disciples did not utter without consideration the prayers which came to their lips, but that they followed with reverence the form of prayer, which the Holy Spirit had prescribed to the whole Church by the mouth of the Prophet. For, though he speaks there of his own kingdom, yet there is no reason to doubt that he principally looks, and intends others to look, to the eternal succession, which the Lord had promised to him. He drew up a perpetual form of prayer, which would be observed, even when the wealth of the kingdom was decayed; and therefore it was a prevailing custom, that prayers for the promised redemption were generally presented in these words. And the design of Matthew was, as we have just hinted, to quote in Hebrew a well-known psalm, for the purpose of showing that Christ was acknowledged by the multitude as a Redeemer. The pronunciation of the words, indeed, is somewhat changed; for it ought rather to have been written, <em>Hoshiana</em>, ( <span class="lang he-il">הושיע נא</span>) <em>Save now, we beseech thee; </em>but we know that it is scarcely possible to take a word from one language into another, without making some alteration in the sound. Nor was it only the ancient people whom God enjoined to pray daily for the kingdom of Christ, but the same rule is now laid down for us. And certainly, as it is the will of God to reign only in the person of his Son, when we say, <em>May thy kingdom come</em>, under this petition is conveyed the same thing which is expressed more clearly in the psalm. Besides, when we pray to God to maintain his Son as our King, we acknowledge that this kingdom was not erected by men, and is not upheld by the power of men, but remains invincible through heavenly protection. </p><p><em>In the name of the Lord. </em>He is said to come in <em>the name of God, </em>who not only conducts himself, but receives the kingdom, by the command and appointment of God. This may be more certainly inferred from the words of <em>MARK, </em>where another exclamation is added, <em>Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, which cometh in the name of the Lord; </em>for they speak thus in reference to the promises; because the Lord had testified that he would at length be a deliverer of that nation, and had appointed as the means the restoration of the kingdom of David. We see then that the honor of Mediator, from whom the restoration of all things and of salvation was to be expected, is ascribed to Christ. Now as it was mean and uneducated men by whom the kingdom of Christ was called <em>the kingdom of David, </em>let us hence learn that this doctrine was at that time well known, which in the present day appears to many to be forced and harsh, because they are not well acquainted with Scripture. </p><p><em>Luke </em>adds a few words, <em>Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest; </em><span class="cite-ref">(719)</span> in which there would be no obscurity, were it not that they do not correspond to the song of the angels, (<span class="bvs">Luk_2:14</span>;) for there the angels ascribe to God <em>glory in heaven, </em>and to men <em>peace on earth; </em>while here both <em>peace </em>and <em>glory </em>are ascribed to God. But there is no contradiction in the meaning; for, though the angels state more distinctly the reason why we ought to sing, <em>Glory to God </em>— <em>namely</em>, because through his mercy men enjoy peace in this world — yet the meaning is the same with what is now declared by the multitude, that there is <em>peace in heaven; </em>for we know that there is no other way in which wretched souls find rest in the world, than by God reconciling himself to them out of heaven. </p><p><strong>(719)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Es lieux tres-hauts</span>;” — “in the very high places.” </p></div>
