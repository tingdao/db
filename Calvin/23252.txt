<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_5:17</span><strong>.</strong><em>Think not. </em>With regard to the perfection of his life, Christ might justly have maintained that he <em>came to fulfill the law: </em>but here he treats of doctrine, not of life. As he afterwards exclaimed, that “<em>the kingdom of God is come</em>, ” (<span class="bvs">Mat_12:28</span>,) and raised the minds of men with unusual expectation, and even admitted disciples by baptism, it is probable, that the minds of many were in a state of suspense and doubt, and were eagerly inquiring, what was the design of that novelty. Christ, therefore, now declares, that his doctrine is so far from being at variance with <em>the law, </em>that it agrees perfectly with <em>the law and the prophets, </em>and not only so, but brings the complete <em>fulfillment </em>of them. </p><p>There appear to have been chiefly two reasons, which induced him to declare this agreement between <em>the law </em>and the Gospel. As soon as any new method of teaching makes its appearance, the body of the people immediately look upon it, as if everything were to be overturned. Now the preaching of the Gospel, as I mentioned a little ago, tended to raise the expectation, that the Church would assume a totally different form from what had previously belonged to it. They thought that the ancient and accustomed government was to be abolished. This opinion, in many respects, was very dangerous. Devout worshippers of God would never have embraced the Gospel, if it had been a revolt from <em>the law; </em>while light and turbulent spirits would eagerly have seized on an occasion offered to them for entirely overthrowing the state of religion: for we know in what insolent freaks rash people are ready to indulge when there is any thing new. </p><p>Besides, Christ saw that the greater part of the Jews, though they professed to believe the Law, were profane and degenerate. The condition of the people was so decayed, every thing was filled with so many corruptions, and the negligence or malice of the priests had so completely extinguished the pure light of doctrine, that there no longer remained any reverence for the Law. But if a new kind of doctrine had been introduced, which would destroy the authority of <em>the Law and the Prophets, </em>religion would have sustained a dreadful injury. This appears to be the first reason, why Christ declared that <em>he had not come to destroy the Law. </em>Indeed, the context makes this abundantly clear: for he immediately adds, by way of confirmation, that it is impossible for <em>even one point of the Law to fail, </em>— and pronounces a curse on those teachers who do not faithfully labor to maintain its authority. </p><p>The second reason was, to refute the wicked slander which, he knew was brought against him by the ignorant and unlearned. This charge, it is evident, had been fastened on his doctrine by the scribes: for he proceeds immediately to direct his discourse against them. We must keep in mind the object which Christ had in view. While he invites and exhorts the Jews to receive the Gospel, he still retains them in obedience to <em>the Law; </em>and, on the other hand, he boldly refutes the base reproaches and slanders, by which his enemies labored to make his preaching infamous or suspected. </p><p>If we intend to reform affairs which are in a state of disorder, we must always exercise such prudence and moderation, as will convince the people, that we do not oppose the eternal Word of God, or introduce any novelty that is contrary to Scripture. We must take care, that no suspicion of such contrariety shall injure the faith of the godly, and that rash men shall not be emboldened by a pretense of novelty. In short, we must endeavor to oppose a profane contempt of the Word of God, and to prevent religion from being despised by the ignorant. The defense which Christ makes, to free his doctrine from slanders, ought to encourage us, if we are now exposed to the same calumnies. That crime was charged against Paul, that he was an apostate from the law of God, (<span class="bvs">Act_21:21</span>) and we need not, therefore, wonder, if the Papists endeavor, in the same manner, to render us odious. Following the example of Christ, we ought to clear ourselves from false accusations, and, at the same time, to profess the truth freely, though it may expose us to unjust reproaches. </p><p><em>I am not come to destroy. </em>God had, indeed, promised a <em>new covenant </em>at the coming of Christ; but had, at the same time, showed, that it would not be different from <em>the first, </em>but that, on the contrary, its design was, to give a perpetual sanction to the covenant, which he had made from the beginning, with his own people. </p><p>“I will write my law, (says he,) in their hearts, <LineBreak />and I will remember their iniquities no more,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Jer_31:33</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(383)</span></p><p>By these words he is so far from departing from the former covenant, that, on the contrary, he declares, that it will be confirmed and ratified, when it shall be succeeded by the new. This is also the meaning of Christ’s words, when he says, that <em>he came to fulfill the law: </em>for he actually fulfilled it, by quickening, with his Spirit, the dead letter, and then exhibiting, in reality, what had hitherto appeared only in figures. </p><p>With respect to doctrine, we must not imagine that the coming of Christ has freed us from the authority of the law: for it is the eternal rule of a devout and holy life, and must, therefore, be as unchangeable, as the justice of God, which it embraced, is constant and uniform. With respect to ceremonies, there is some appearance of a change having taken place; but it was only the use of them that was abolished, for their meaning was more fully confirmed. The coming of Christ has taken nothing away even from ceremonies, but, on the contrary, confirms them by exhibiting the truth of shadows: for, when we see their full effect, we acknowledge that they are not vain or useless. Let us therefore learn to maintain inviolable this sacred tie between the law and the Gospel, which many improperly attempt to break. For it contributes not a little to confirm the authority of the Gospel, when we learn, that it is nothing else than <em>a fulfillment of the law; </em>so that both, with one consent, declare God to be their Author. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(383)</span> The reader will find a copious illustration of this remarkable passage in Jeremiah, and of its bearing on the Christian system, in the author's commentary on the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
