<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Take thou also unto thee principal spices. </em>Although the oil here treated of was not only destined for the anointing of the priests, but also of the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, the altars, and all the vessels, yet no fitter place occurs for discussing the sacred unction, than by connecting it with the priesthood, on which it depends. First of all its composition is described, exquisite both in expensiveness and odor; that by its very excellence and costliness the Israelites may learn that no ordinary thing is represented by it; for we have already often seen that there had been set before this rude people a splendor in sacred symbols, which might affect their external senses, so as to uplift them as it were by steps to the knowledge of spiritual things. We must now see why the priest as well as all the vessels and the other parts of the tabernacle had need of anointing. I conclude that without controversy this oil mixed with precious perfumes was a type of the Holy Spirit; for the metaphor of anointing is everywhere met with, when the prophets would commend the power, the effects, and the gifts of the Spirit. Nor is there any doubt but that God, by anointing kings, testified that He would endow them with the spirit of prudence, fortitude, clemency, and justice. Hence it is easily gathered that the tabernacle was sprinkled with oil, that the Israelites might learn that all the exercises of piety profited nothing without the secret operation of the Spirit. Nay, something more was shewn forth, viz., that the efficacy and grace of the Spirit existed and reigned in the truth of the shadows itself; and that whatever good was derived from them was applied by the gift of the same Spirit for the use of believers. In the altar, reconciliation was to be sought, that God might be propitious to them; but, as the Apostle testifies, the sacrifice of Christ’s death would not otherwise have been efficacious to appease God, if He had not suffered by the Spirit, (<span class="bvs">Heb_9:14</span>;) and how does its fruit now reach us, except because the same Spirit washes our souls with the blood, which once was shed, as Peter teaches us? (<span class="bvs">1Pe_1:2</span>.) Who now consecrates our prayers but the Spirit, who dictates the groans which cannot be uttered; and by whom we cry, Abba, Father? (<span class="bvs">Rom_8:15</span>.) Nay, whence comes the faith which admits us to a participation in the benefits of Christ, but from the same Spirit? </p><p>But we were especially to consider the anointing of the priest, who was sanctified by the Spirit of God for the performance of his office; thus, as Isaiah, in the person of Jesus Christ, declares that he was anointed with the spirit of prophecy, (<span class="bvs">Isa_61:1</span>;) and David affirms the same of the royal spirit, (<span class="bvs">Psa_45:7</span>;) so Daniel is our best interpreter and witness how the sacerdotal unction was at length manifested (in Him <span class="cite-ref">(181)</span>), for when he says that the time, when by the death of Christ the prophecy shall be sealed up, was determined upon “to anoint the holy of holies,” he plainly reminds us that the spiritual pattern, which answers to the visible sanctuary, is in Christ; so that believers may really feel that these shadows were not mere empty things. (<span class="bvs">Dan_9:24</span>.) We now perceive why Aaron was anointed, viz., because Christ was consecrated by the Holy Spirit to be the Mediator between God and man; and why the tabernacle and its vessels were sprinkled with the same oil, viz., because we are only made partakers of the holiness of Christ by the gift and operation of the Spirit. <span class="cite-ref">(182)</span> Some translate it in the masculine gender, where of the vessels it is said, “<em>whatsoever </em>toucheth them shall be holy;” <span class="bvs">Exo_30:29</span> : as if they were not to be touched by any but the priests; but it appears to me to be rather spoken for another reason, viz., that they may embue the oblations with their own sanctity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(181)</span> Added from <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(182)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ou il est dit, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Que tout ce que, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">etc., aucuns mettent legendre masculin, Celuy qui les sanctifiera</span>;” where it is said, “Whatsoever,” etc., some put the masculine gender, “He who shall sanctify them.” This is the translation of <em>LXX. </em>and <em>V</em>. </p></div></div>
