<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet relates again, that the Jews were deprived of support, and that they in a manner pined away in their distress, because they robbed God of the worship due to him. He first repeats the fact, <em>Ye have looked for much, but behold little </em><span class="cite-ref">(138)</span> It may happen that one is contented with a very slender portion, because much is not expected. They who are satisfied with their own penury are not anxious though their portion of food is but scanty, though they are constrained to feed on acorns. Those who are become hardened in enduring evils, do not seek much; but they who desire much, are more touched and vexed by their penury. This is the reason why the Prophet says, Ye have looked for much, and, behold, there was but little; that is, “Ye are not like the peasants, who satisfy themselves with any sort of food, and are not troubled on account of their straitened circumstances; but your desire has led you to seek abundance. Hence ye seek and greedily lay hold on things on every side; but, behold, it comes to little.” </p><p>In the second place he adds, <em>Ye have brought it home</em>. He farther mentions another kind of evil—that when they gathered wine, and corn, and money, all these things immediately vanished. <em>Ye have brought it home, and I have blown upon it</em>. By saying that they brought it home, he intimates that what they had acquired was laid up, that it might be preserved safely; for they who had filled their storehouses, and wine-cellars, and bags, thought that they had no more to do with God. Hence it was that profane men securely indulged themselves; they thought that they were beyond the reach of danger, when their houses were well filled. God, on the contrary, shows that their houses became empty, when filled with treasures and provisions. But he speaks still more distinctly—that he had blown upon them, that is, that he had dissipated them by his breath: for the Prophet did not deem it enough historically to narrate what the Jews had experienced; but his purpose also was to point out the cause, as it were, by the finger. He therefore teaches us, that what they laid in store in their houses did not without a cause vanish away; but that this happened through the blowing of God, even because he cursed their blessing, according to what we shall hereafter see in the Prophet Malachi. </p><p>He then adds, <em>Why is this? saith Jehovah of hosts</em>. God here asks, not because he had any doubts on the subject, but that he might by this sort of goading rouse the Jews from their lethargy,—“Think of the cause, and know that my hand is not guided by a blind impulse when it strikes you. You ought, then, to consider the reason why all things thus decay and perish.” Here again is sharply reproved the stupidity of the people, because they attended not to the cause of their evils; for they ought to have known this of themselves. </p><p>But God gives the answer, because he saw that they remained stupefied—<em>On account of my house</em>, he says, <em>because it is waste </em><span class="cite-ref">(139)</span> God here assigns the cause; he shows that though no one of them considered why they were so famished, the judgement of his curse was yet sufficiently manifest, on account of the Temple remaining a waste. And you, he says, run, every one to his own house. Some read, You take delight, every one in his own house; for it is the verb <span class="lang he-il">רצה</span>, <em>retse</em>, which we have lately noticed; and it means either to take pleasure in a thing, or to run. Every one, then, runs to his house, or, Every one delights in his house. But it is more suitable to the context to give this rendering, Every one runs to his house. For the Prophet here reminds the Jews that they were slow and slothful in the work of building the Temple, because they hastened to their private houses. He then reproves here their ardor in being intent on building their own houses, so that they had no leisure to build the Temple. This is the hastening which the Prophet blames and condemns in the Jews. </p><p>We may hence learn again, that they had long delayed to build the sanctuary after the time had arrived: for, as we have mentioned yesterday, they who think the Jews returned in the fifty-eighth year, and that they had not then undergone the punishment denounced by Jeremiah, are very deluded; for they thus obscure the favor of God; nay, they wholly subvert the truth of the promises, as though they had returned contrary to God’s will, through the permission of Cyrus, when yet Isaiah says, that Cyrus would be the instrument of their promised redemption. (<span class="bvs">Isa_45:1</span>.) Surely, then, Cyrus must have been dead before the time was fulfilled! and in that case God could not have been the redeemer of his people. Therefore Eusebius, and those who agree with him, did thus most absurdly confound the order of time. It now follows— </p><p><strong>(138)</strong> The first word in this verse, [<span class="lang he-il">פנה</span> ], is evidently a participle noun; similar instances we find in verse 6. The verse, literally rendered, is as follows— </p><p>Looking for much, and behold little! <LineBreak />And you brought it home, and I blew upon it; <LineBreak />On what account this, saith Jehovah of hosts? <LineBreak />On account of my house, because it is waste, <LineBreak />And ye are running, each to his own house. </p><p>The first line is put in an absolute form, as is sometimes the case in Hebrew; “There has been,” or some such words being understood. Both the Targum and the Septuagint read [<span class="lang he-il">היה</span> ] instead of [<span class="lang he-il">הנה</span> ], which would be more suitable to the word which follows, which has [<span class="lang he-il">ל</span> ] before it. The line would then be— </p><p><em>There has been </em>looking for much, but it came to little. </p><p>The “blowing” seems to be a metaphor taken from scorching wind, blowing on vegetation, and causing it to wither. The last line may be thus rendered— </p><p>And ye <em>are </em>delighted, each with his own house. </p><p>—<em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(139)</strong> This is the literal rendering—“On account of my house, because it is waste.” [<span class="lang he-il">אשר</span> ] is not “which” here, for it is followed by [<span class="lang he-il">הוא</span> ], “it;” but a conjunction, “because.” The word <em>quod </em>, in Latin, admits of two similar meanings.—<em>Ed. </em></p></div>
