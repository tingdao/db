This sentence, that the earth trembles, when it is smitten by God, is usually regarded as a general declaration; and the Prophets do often exalt the power of God in order to fill us with fear, and of this we shall see an instance in the next verse.

Ascend then shall the land as a river. The ascent of the earth would be nothing else but inundation, which would cover its surface.
