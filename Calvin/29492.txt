<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>To whom God was pleased to make known. </em>Here he puts a bridle upon the presumption of men, that they may not allow themselves to be wise, or to inquire beyond what they ought, but may learn to rest satisfied with this one thing that it has so pleased God. For the good pleasure of God ought to be perfectly sufficient for us as a reason. This, however, is said principally for the purpose of commending the grace of God; for Paul intimates, that mankind did by no means furnish occasion for God’s making them participants of this secret, when he teaches that he was led to this of his own accord, and because he <em>was pleased </em>to do so. For it is customary for Paul to place the good pleasure of God in opposition to all human merits and external causes. </p><p><em>What are the riches. </em>We must always take notice, in what magnificent terms he speaks in extolling the dignity of the gospel. For he was well aware that the ingratitude of men is so great, that notwithstanding that this treasure is inestimable, and the grace of God in it is so distinguished, they, nevertheless, carelessly despise it, or at least think lightly of it. Hence, not resting satisfied with the term <em>mystery</em>, he adds <em>glory, </em>and that, too, not trivial or common. For <em>riches</em>, according to Paul, denote, as is well known, amplitude. <span class="cite-ref">(342)</span> He states particularly, that those <em>riches </em>have been manifested among the Gentiles; for what is more wonderful than that the Gentiles, who had during so many ages been sunk in death, so as to appear to be utterly ruined, are all on a sudden reckoned among the sons of God, and receive the inheritance of salvation? </p><p><em>Which is Christ in you. </em>What he had said as to the Gentiles generally he applies to the Colossians themselves, that they may more effectually recognize in themselves the grace of God, and may embrace it with greater reverence. He says, therefore, <em>which is Christ, </em>meaning by this, that all that secret is contained in Christ, and that all the riches of heavenly wisdom are obtained by them when they have Christ, as we shall find him stating more openly a little afterwards. He adds, <em>in you</em>, because they now possess Christ, from whom they were lately so much estranged, that nothing could exceed it. Lastly, he calls Christ the <em>hope of glory</em>, that they may know that nothing is wanting to them for complete blessedness when they have obtained Christ. This, however, is a wonderful work of God, that in <em>earthen </em>and frail <em>vessels </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_4:7</span>) the hope of heavenly glory resides. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(342)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Signifient magnificence</span>;” — “Denote magnificence.” </p></div></div>
