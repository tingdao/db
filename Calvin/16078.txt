<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>What shall the tongue of deceit give thee? </em><span class="cite-ref">(50)</span> The Prophet aggravates the malice of his enemies by asserting that they were so wickedly inclined as to be driven to evil speaking when they saw no prospect of deriving any advantage from such a course of conduct. He however seems to express more than this, — he seems farther to intimate, that after they have poured forth all the venom of their calumnies, their attempts will nevertheless be vain and ineffectual. As God is the maintainer of the innocence of his servants, David, inspired with hope from this truth, rises up against them with heroic courage, as if about to triumph over the whole crowd of his calumniators, <span class="cite-ref">(51)</span> reproaching them for doing nothing else than betraying an impotent passion for evil speaking, which God at length would cause to recoil upon their own heads. It is a consideration well fitted to assuage the grief of all the godly, when their good name is unrighteously wounded by calumniators, that such malicious characters will gain nothing thereby in the end, because God will disappoint their expectation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(50)</span> The Psalmist here addresses himself in particular to his traducers. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(51)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme s’il avoit desia le triomphe contre toute la bande de scs ennemis</span>.” —<em>Fr</em>. “As if he had already triumphed over the whole host of his enemies.” </p></div></div>
