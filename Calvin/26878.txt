<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>But Mary stood at the sepulcher without. </em>The Evangelist now begins to describe the manner in which Christ appeared both to the women and to the disciples, to testify his resurrection. Though he mentions but one woman, <em>Mary, </em>yet I think it is probable that the other women were also along with her; for it is not reasonable to suppose, as some have done, that the women fainted through fear. Those writers wish to avoid a contradiction, but I have already shown that no such contradiction exists. </p><p>As to the women remaining <em>at the sepulchre, </em>while the disciples return to the city, they are not entitled to great accommodation on this account; for the disciples carry with them consolation and joy, but the women torment themselves by idle and useless <em>weeping. </em>In short, it is superstition alone, accompanied by carnal feelings, that keeps them <em>near the sepulchre </em></p></div>
