<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Thou shalt bring them in. </em>The metaphor of planting denotes a firm habitation; as also in <span class="bvs">Psa_44:2</span>, “Thou didst drive out the heathen with thine hand, and plantedst” our fathers, and causedst them to take root. Moreover, by his commendatory allusion to the temple, Moses excites in the people’s hearts a desire for the land, which was to be God’s “Sanctuary;” and by this secret thought attracts them, indifferent as they were, to seek the enjoyment of this great blessing. He also prophesies of Mount Sion many ages before the temple was erected there; from whence we gather that it was not chosen by man’s will, but consecrated by the eternal counsel and predestination of God. For it behooved that the gratuitous favor of God should manifest itself as to this place, as well as to men’s persons. Thus, in <span class="bvs">Psa_78:67</span>, it is said, </p><p>“He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; but chose the of Judah,” etc. </p><p>Elsewhere also, (<span class="bvs">Psa_132:13</span>,) </p><p>“For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation: this is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it.” </p><p>But the stability of the temple is also foretold; as in another passage, <span class="cite-ref">(167)</span> “Thy hand hath founded Zion.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_87:1</span>.) And God himself declares by Isaiah that He will not suffer Jerusalem to be laid waste, (<span class="bvs">Isa_37:26</span>,) because of ancient times He had formed it. But although the whole land of Canaan is elsewhere called God’s rest, and the people was never collected into one city, yet, because God blessed the whole nation and land out c f His sanctuary, therefore is special mention made of His holy mountain. But this prophecy was very needful for the support of their minds, because Jerusalem only came into their power at a late period; and doubtless their posterity would have been still more slow to take possession of it had not their hearts been stimulated by this promise. A short sentence follows concerning God’s eternal reign, on which the perpetuity of the Church is founded. Thus David, (<span class="bvs">Psa_102:27</span>,) after having said that God would always be the, same, and His years would have no end, thus concludes, “The children of thy servants shall continue, and their deed shall be established before thee.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_102:28</span>.) Moses, then, would extend the hope of the people to all ages, because of God’s kingdom there is no end. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(167)</span> It will be seen that the sense, and not the words, of the citation are given. </p></div></div>
