<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And then will I confess to them </em><span class="cite-ref">(482)</span> By using the word <span class="lang el-gr">ὁμολογήσω</span><em>, I will confess, </em><span class="cite-ref">(483)</span> Christ appears to allude to the vain boasting, by which hypocrites now vaunt themselves. <em>“ </em>They indeed have <em>confessed </em>me with the tongue, and imagine that they have fully discharged their duty. The <em>confession </em>of my name is now heard aloud from their tongue. But I too will <em>confess </em>on the opposite side, that their profession is deceitful and false.” And what is contained in Christ’s <em>confession? </em>That he never reckoned them among his own people, even at the time when they boasted that they were the pillars of the church. </p><p><em>Depart from me. </em>He orders those persons to go out from his presence, who had stolen, under a false title, an unjust and temporary possession of his house. From this passage in our Lord’s discourse Paul seems to have taken what he says to Timothy, </p><p>The Lord knoweth who are his: and, let every one who calleth on the name of Christ depart from iniquity, (<span class="bvs">2Ti_2:19</span>.) </p><p>The former clause is intended to prevent weak minds from being alarmed or discouraged by the desertion of those who had a great and distinguished reputation: <span class="cite-ref">(484)</span> for he declares that they were disowned by the Lord, though by a vain show they captivated the eyes of men. He then exhorts all those who wish to be reckoned among the disciples of Christ, to <em>withdraw </em>early from <em>iniquity, </em>that Christ may not drive them from his presence, when he shall <em>“separate the sheep from the goats</em>, ” (<span class="bvs">Mat_25:33</span>.) </p><p><strong>(482)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et lors je leur diray ouvertement</span>;” — “and then will I openly say to them.” </p><p><strong>(483)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le mot Grec dont use l'Evangeliste signifie proprement, Je leur confesseray</span>;” — “the Greek word, which the Evangelist uses, literally signifies ‘I will confess to them.’“ </p><p><strong>(484)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’aucuns qui auront en grand bruit, et auront este fort estimez</span>;”— “of any who shall have made great noise, and shall have been greatly esteemed.” </p></div>
