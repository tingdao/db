<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Not only this part. </em>This is first disorderly handled in<span class="cite-ref">(389)</span> that Demetrius is careful for religion after other things;<span class="cite-ref">(390)</span> because nothing is more absurd than to prefer the belly before the goddess; but even this is also vain, in that he pretendeth that the worship of Diana is in hazard. For if he had suffered no loss by Paul’s doctrine, he would have sat quietly at home; he would neither have taken thought for the worship of Diana, neither would he have troubled others. What is the cause, then, he is so diligent and so earnest in his business? even this, because he was plagued at home; and because he saw that he and his copartners had no honest or probable cause to make any stir, he goeth about to color [gloss] the matter with some other color. Therefore, to the end he may cover the shame of his wicked fact, he cloaketh it with the title of religion, which is plausible. So that the wicked, howsoever they strive frowardly against God, yet they gather here and there honest excuses<span class="cite-ref">(391)</span> impudently; but God doth not suffer himself to be mocked, but doth rather pull them out of their starting-holes [subterfuges]. There needeth no other witness to refute Demetrius’ hypocrisy, because he cutteth his own throat with his own words, when he betrayeth the sorrow which he had conceived, because of the loss which he sustained.<span class="cite-ref">(392)</span> In like state do the Papists stand at this day; they boast with full mouth that they be patrons of the Catholic faith and of the holy mother the Church, but when they have spoken<span class="cite-ref">(393)</span> thus touching their zeal, in the very handling of the cause they breathe out with open throat the smell of their kitchens. But if we have a desire to handle the cause of godliness purely and in earnest, let us forget our commodities, that the glory of God may have the chief place. For the show of profit doth so tie all our senses with enticements, that though we wander through all manner of wickedness, yet do we flatter ourselves so long as we be determined to provide for our own commodity.</p><p><em>Whom all Asia and the world doth worship. </em>It seemeth to Demetrius an unmeet thing that Diana her majesty should be brought to naught, which all the world doth reverence and worship, and this is a common starting-hole [subterfuge] for all superstitious persons, to pretend the consent of the multitude. But true religion requireth a more steadfast stay than in the will and pleasure of men. There is nothing which at this day doth more keep back the simple and unskillful than that they dare not cast from them (such ancient) errors as are commonly received everywhere. Because they feign and imagine that that which pleased many, though foolishly and rashly, is to be counted lawful. For which cause they be not afraid boldly to set the very name of custom against God himself. But the Lord doth prescribe to us another manner of rule, to wit, that being content with his authority alone, we do not pass either for the opinion of men, nor for our own commodity, nor for the custom of many nations. </p><p><strong>(389)</strong></p><p>“ Hoc primum praepostere,” this is, in the first place, preposterous. </p><p><strong>(390)</strong></p><p>“ Secundo tandem loco,” only in the second place. </p><p><strong>(391)</strong></p><p>“ Captant honestos praetextus,” catch at specious pretexts. </p><p><strong>(392)</strong></p><p>“ Dum privatae jacturae dolorem prodit,” while he betrays grief for a private loss. </p><p><strong>(393)</strong></p><p>“ Sic praefati,” premised this much. </p></div>
