<div class="comment-content"><p>He goes on with the same subject, — that the priests conducted themselves very shamefully in their office, and that the people had become hardened through their example, so that the whole of religion was disregarded. Hence he says, that the <em>doors </em>were not closed by them. Some interpreters connect the two things together — that they closed not the doors of the temple, nor kindled the altar for nothing; and thus they apply the adverb, <span class="lang he-il">חנם</span>, <em>chenam</em>, to both clauses; as though he had said, that they were hirelings, who did not freely devote themselves to serve God, but looked for profit and gain in everything: and this is the commonly received explanation. <span class="cite-ref">(206)</span> But it seems better to me to take them separately and to say, Who does even shut the doors? not however for nothing, and the copulative, <span class="lang he-il">ו</span>, <em>vau</em>, as in many other places, may be rendered <em>even</em>: and yet <em>ye kindle not for nothing my altar</em>; as though God had said, “I have fixed your works; ye are then to me as hired servants; and now since I have ordered a reward to be given to you whenever ye stand at my altar, why do ye not close my door?” Some render <span class="lang he-il">חנם</span>, <em>chenam</em>, in vain, and give this explanation “Who closes the doors? then kindle not afterwards in vain my altar;” as though God rejected the whole service, which had been corrupted by the avarice or the sloth of the priests, and by the presumption of the people. </p><p>It is indeed certain that it is better to separate the two clauses so that the adverb, <span class="lang he-il">חנם</span>, <em>chenam</em>, may be confined to the letter; but there may yet, as I have said, be a two-fold meaning. If we render, <span class="lang he-il">חנם</span>, <em>chenam</em>, in vain the import is that the Prophet declares that they labored to no purpose while they thus sacrificed to God contrary to his law for they ought to have attended especially to the rule prescribed to them: as then they despised this, he justly says, “Offer not to me in vain;” and thus the future tense is to be taken for the imperative, as we know is the case sometimes in Hebrew. </p><p>But no interpreter seems to have sufficiently considered the reason why the Prophet speaks of not closing the doors of the temple. The priests, we know were set over the temple for this reason — that nothing polluted might be admitted; for there were of the Levites some doorkeepers, and others stood at the entrance; in short, all had their stations: and then when they had brought in the victim it was the office of the priests to examine it and to see that it was such as the law of God required. As then it was their special office to see that nothing polluted should be received into the temple of God, he justly complains here that they indiscriminately received what was faulty and profane: hence he rightly declares (for this seems to me to be the true exposition) “Offer not in vain.” He then draws the conclusion, that the priests lost all their labor in thus sacrificing, because God would not have his name profaned, and justly preferred obedience to all sacrifices. He therefore denies that they did any good in slaying victims, because they ought in the first place to have attended to this — not to change anything in God’s word and not to deviate from it in the least. But I cannot now proceed farther. </p><p><strong>(206)</strong> Adopted by <em>Jerome</em>, <em>Cyril</em>, and in our version, and by <em>Henry</em>, <em>Scott</em>, <em>Adam Clarke</em>, and <em>Henderson</em>. But <em>Marckius </em>takes another view, previously taken by <em>Drusius</em>, <em>Gataker</em>, and <em>Cocceius</em>, according to the following version — </p><p>Who is there moreover among you? let him even close the doors, That ye may not kindle my altar in vain. </p><p>“What he seems to say is this,” observes <em>Drusius</em>, “I wish there were some one so inflamed by a pious zeal, as to close the doors, and thus to exclude all unlawful sacrifices.” To kindle or light the altar was to light the fire under it to consume the sacrifice. The <em>Targum </em>favors “in vain,” or to no purpose, “Offer ye not on my altar an execrable oblation.” The word <span class="lang he-il">הכם</span> is used in both senses — “for nothing” or without gain, <span class="bvs">Gen_29:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Exo_21:2</span>,—and “in vain” or uselessly, <span class="bvs">Pro_1:27</span>; <span class="bvs">Eze_6:10</span></p><p>It is difficult to know which of these views is the right one. What seems against our version is the negative <span class="lang he-il">לא</span> in the second line. The sense given would be better brought out without it; and so <em>Jerome </em>leaves it out in his explanation. The form also of the sentence being changed renders it improbable that <span class="lang he-il">חנם</span> belongs to the former clause. The version of <em>Drusius </em>comes nearest to the original, and is countenanced by the <em>Septuagint </em>and the <em>Targum</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
