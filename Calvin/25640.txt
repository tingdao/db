<div class="comment-content"><p>Though Luke introduces some things between them, there can be no doubt that this example was intended by Christ to confirm the discourse which we have last examined. He points out what condition awaits those <span class="cite-ref">(307)</span> who neglect the care of the poor, and indulge in all manner of gluttony; who give themselves up to drunkenness and other pleasures, and allow their neighbors to pine with hunger; nay, who cruelly kill with famine those whom they ought to have relieved, when the means of doing so were in their power. Some look upon it as a simple parable; but, as the name <em>Lazarus </em>occurs in it, I rather consider it to be the narrative of an actual fact. But that is of little consequence, provided that the reader comprehends the doctrine which it contains. </p><p><strong>19.</strong><em>There was a certain rich man </em>He is, first of all, described as <em>clothed in purple and fine linen, </em>and enjoying every day splendor and luxury. This denotes a life spent amidst delicacies, and superfluity, and pomp. Not that all elegance and ornaments of dress are in themselves displeasing to God, or that all the care bestowed on preparing victuals ought to be condemned; but because it seldom happens that such things are kept in moderation. He who has a liking for fine dress will constantly increase his luxury by fresh additions; and it is scarcely possible that he who indulges in sumptuous and well garnished tables shall avoid falling into intemperance. But the chief accusation brought against this man is his cruelty in suffering <em>Lazarus, </em>poor and<em>full of sores, to lie </em>out of doors <em>at his gate. </em></p><p>These two clauses Christ has exhibited in contrast. The <em>rich man, </em>devoted to the pleasures of the table and to display, swallowed up, like an unsatiable gulf, his enormous wealth, but remained unmoved by the poverty and distresses of <em>Lazarus, </em>and knowingly and willingly suffered him to pine away with hunger, cold, and the offensive smell of his <em>sores. </em>In this manner Ezekiel (<span class="bvs">Eze_16:49</span>) accuses <em>Sodom </em>of not stretching out her hand to the poor amidst <em>fullness of bread </em>and wine. The<em>fine linen, </em>which is a peculiarly delicate fabric, is well-known to have been used by the inhabitants of eastern countries for elegance and splendor; a fashion which the Popish priests have imitated in what they call their <em>surplices. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(307)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quelle sera hors de ce monde la condition de ceux</span>;” — “what will be out of this world the condition of those.” </p></div></div>
