<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>If any one of them that believe not invites you. </em>Here follows an exception, to this effect, that if a believer has been warned, that what is set before him has been offered to an idol, and sees that there is a danger of offense being given, he sins against the brethren if he does not abstain. He shows then, in short, that care must be taken not to hurt weak consciences. </p><p>When he says — <em>and you are willing to go</em>, he intimates indirectly, that he does not altogether approve of it, and that it would be better if they declined, but as it is a thing indifferent, he does not choose to forbid it absolutely. And, certainly, there could be nothing better than to keep at a distance from such snares — not that those are expressly to be condemned, who accommodate themselves to men only in so far as conscience permits, <span class="cite-ref">(601)</span> but because it becomes us to proceed with caution, <span class="cite-ref">(602)</span> where we see that we are in danger of falling. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(601)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Seulement autant que faire se pent sans offenser Dieu</span>;” — “Only so far as they can do so without offending God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(602)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Auec grand auis et prudence</span>;” — “With great care and prudence.” </p></div></div>
