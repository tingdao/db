<div class="comment-content"><p>God confirms in this passage what he had previously said of the power of his word. These two verses, then, are to be taken as explanatory, for no new subject is introduced; but the former part is confirmed — that the Prophets spoke not in vain, or to no purpose, because they were invested with celestial power to plant and to build, and, on the other hand, to pull down and to root up, according to what we have quoted from Paul, who says that true teachers are armed with such power. (<span class="bvs">2Co_10:5</span>) We have in readiness, he says, vengeance against all the unbelieving, however proud they may be: and though their height may terrify the whole world, yet we have a sword in our hands which will stay them; for God’s word has sufficient power to destroy the rebellious. </p><p>God then proceeds with the same subject when he says, <em>What seest thou, Jeremiah? </em>He had set before him a staff or a rod of almond, as some render the word: and <span class="lang he-il">שקר</span>, <em>shaked, </em>means an almond; but as it comes from a verb which means to watch or to hasten, we cannot fitly render it here, almond. I do not, however, deny that the Hebrew word has this meaning. But it is written here with <em>Kamets; </em>the participle which afterwards follows has <em>Holem: </em>we hence see what affinity there is between the two words. The word <span class="lang he-il">שקר</span><em>, shaked, </em>an almond, is derived from the verb, <span class="lang he-il">שקר</span>, <em>shakad, </em>to watch; and it has been thought that this tree is so called, because it brings forth fruit earlier than other trees; for almonds, as it is well known, flower even in winter, and in the coldest seasons. Now, were we to say in Latin, I see a rod or a staff of almond; and were the answer given, Thou hast rightly seen, for I watch, the allusion in the words would not appear, the sentence would lose its beauty, and there would indeed be no meaning. It is hence necessary to give another version, except we wish to pervert the passage, and to involve the Prophet’s meaning in darkness. It should be, “I see the rod, “or the staff, “of a watcher.” Let us grant that the almond is intended; yet the tree may be called watchful, according to what etymology requires, and also the sense of the passage, as all must see. <span class="cite-ref">(14)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(14)</span> The word is rendered “a rod of almond” by the <em>Septuagint, </em>the <em>Arabic </em>version, and <em>Theodotion; </em>and also by <em>Piscator, Drusius, Grotius, </em>and <em>Blayney; </em>and “the rod of the watcher” by<em>Sym</em>. , <em>Aq</em>. , and the <em>Vulgate </em>The latter is no doubt more suitable in a translation. Some conclude, from what is related in <span class="bvs">Num_17:0</span>, that the head of each tribe carried a wand or a staff made of the almond tree as a token of watchfulness: if so, the probability is, that this wand was presented to the view of the Prophet. It being a well-known emblem of watchfulness, and called perhaps the watchful rod or staff, it was most suitable to the purposes here designed. The verb <span class="lang he-il">שקד</span> does not mean to hasten, but to watch, or to be awake. Then the version of the passage would be the following: - </p><p><span class="cite-note">11</span>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, “What seest thou, Jeremiah?” and I said, “The rod of a watcher is what I see.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">12</span>. Then Jehovah said to me, “Thou seest rightly, for I am watching over my word to do it.” </p><p>— <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
