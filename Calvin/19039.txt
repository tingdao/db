<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah proceeds with the same prediction: he says, that a terrible <em>wind </em>was coming, which would not only <em>disperse </em>or <em>clear away, </em>but dissipate and overthrow all things. He then expresses how great and how grievous would be the calamity which he had before mentioned. He compares it to dry or and wind; for <span class="lang he-il">צח</span>, <em>tsach, </em>sometimes means “clear,” and sometimes “arid,” as the greatest dryness is found on high places. He means, no doubt, here the wind, which is violent, and disturbs the whole atmosphere, when there are no clouds, and where no trees impede its course. Hence, he speaks of high and desert places. It is the same as though he had said, that so great would be the violence of God’s vengeance, and so irresistible would be the eruption, that it would be like a violent wind when it passes through high regions and through dry land or desert places. He says, <em>Towards the way of the daughter of my people; </em>as though he had said, — that the course of the wind would be such as to bear directly on Judea. The mode of speaking here used is well known to all who are in any degree acquainted with the writings of the prophets. “The daughter of my people, “means the people themselves. <em>Come, </em>then, <em>shall wind </em>towards Judea. </p><p>He then adds, <em>Not to scatter nor to cleanse </em>Husbandmen are wont to winnow the corn when taken from the thrashing — floor, that the chaff may be carried away by the wind: but the Prophet says, that this wind would not be to clear away or scatter the chaff; for it will be, he says, a very <em>vehement wind </em>He means, in short, that God would shew so much displeasure towards the Jews, that he would no longer chastise them in a moderate degree, or use any moderation, as he had done previously; for God had already often punished the Jews, but had hitherto acted the part of a physician, having endeavored to heal the vices of the people. As, then, these corrections had been without fruit, the Prophet now says, that God’s wrath would now come, not to cleanse as before, nor to scatter the chaff, but to consume everything among the people. Hence he adds (for the two verses are connected together) <em>a fuller wind, </em>or one more complete, <em>shall come </em>to them. Some read, “from these places, “so they render <span class="lang he-il">מ</span>; but it is rather to be taken as noting the comparative degree, — that this wind would be much rougher and more violent than other winds which usually clear the land or scatter away the chaff, and separate it from the corn: <em>come, </em>then, <em>shall a much more violent wind </em></p></div>
