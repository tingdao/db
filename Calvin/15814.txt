<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>The wicked shall see it. </em><span class="cite-ref">(350)</span> Here follows a contrast similar to that which we met with in <span class="bvs">Psa_2:5</span>, which renders the grace of God towards the faithful the more illustrious. His meaning is, that though the wicked may cast off all regard to piety, and banish from their minds all thoughts of human affairs being under the superintending providence of God, they shall yet be made to feel, whether they will or no, that the righteous, in compliance with God’s command, do not vainly devote themselves to the cultivation of charity and mercy. Let them harden themselves as they choose, yet he declares that the honor, which God confers upon his children, shall be exhibited to them, the sight of which shall make them gnash with their teeth, and shall excite an envy that shall consume them by inches. <span class="cite-ref">(351)</span> In conclusion, he adds, that <em>the wicked shall be disappointed of their desires </em>They are never content, but are continually thirsting after something, and their confidence is as presumptuous as their avarice is unbounded. And hence, in their foolish expectations, they do not hesitate at grasping at the whole world. But the prophet tells them that God will snatch from them what they imagined was already in their possession, so that they shall always depart destitute and famishing. </p><p><strong>(350)</strong> “<em>The wicked shall see it</em>; <em>i.e</em>. , the exalted horn ” — <em>Dimock </em></p><p><strong>(351)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et par une envie qu’ils auront les fera mourir a petit feu</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
