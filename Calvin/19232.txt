<div class="comment-content"><p>He adds, <em>That I may establish the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land abounding in milk and honey, according to </em>what it is at <em>this day </em>Here he does not refer to the chief part of their happiness; but only the land of Canaan is mentioned as the pledge or the earnest of God’s favor; for his promise had regard to something much higher than to the land of Canaan. God had indeed promised this as an inheritance to the Israelites: but when he says, that he would be their God and they his people, the promise of eternal life and of celestial glory is included, according to what is said elsewhere, that he is not the God of the dead but of the living. (<span class="bvs">Mat_22:31</span>) And we must ever bear in mind what is said by the Prophet Habakkuk, </p><p>“Thou art our God, we shall not die.” (<span class="bvs">Hab_1:12</span>) </p><p>God then promised to the Israelites something far greater than the possession of the land, when he said, that <em>he would be their God </em>But that land was a symbol, an earnest and a pledge of his paternal favor. All these things well agree together. </p><p>And to the same purpose is what the Prophet adds, that God had formerly <em>sworn </em>to <em>their fathers, </em>that he would give them that land by an hereditary right: and this promise had been fulfined to their posterity. Were any to lay hold on this only, — that God’s favor was seen in the land of Canaan, because they had obtained it through the expulsion of the heathens by God’s kindness, the view would be frigid, and the Prophet would diminish much from that promise which far exceeds all that man can conceive. Hence, as I have said, in speaking of the land of Canaan, he accommodates himself no doubt to the comprehension of a rude and ignorant people, and mentions the earnest and the pledge, that they alight see by their eyes, exhibited to them even in this world and in this frail life some evidence of that favor, which far surpasses all that can be desired in the world. </p><p>Now, when he says, <em>That I may establish </em><span class="cite-ref">(33)</span><em>the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, </em>God doubtless shews that though the Jews should obey him, they had not yet deserved by their obedience the inheritance promised before they were born. God then here proves that it was through his gratuitous kindness that; they became heirs of the land. How so? because they were not created when God sware to Abraham that he would give that land to him and to his posterity. As then the promise had been given long before, it follows that it could not be ascribed to the merits of the people, that they had at length in due time obtained the land. As to the oath, God by referring to it extols his favor; for he not only promised the land for an heritage to the children of Abraham, but he also added an oath, that the covenant might appear more sure. But the Prophet at the same time intimates, that they, if ungrateful to God, might justly be deprived of the promised inheritance; as though he had said, “There is no ground for you to expostulate with God, as though he defrauded you, were he to cast you out of the land; for God himself does not disinherit you, but your own wickedness; and ye are now unworthy, for God regards you not as his children.” While then the Prophet takes away every ground for boasting, that the Jews might not think that they possessed the land as a reward for their merits, he also reminds them that they might be justly deprived of their land, and that on account of their own fault, as they rendered not to God the service they owed to him. Hence he says, <em>that I might establish the oath which I have sworn to your fathers </em></p><p><em>A land, </em>he says, <em>flowing with milk and honey: </em>this mode of speaking was often adopted by Moses, (<span class="bvs">Exo_3:8</span>, <span class="bvs">Exo_3:17</span>; <span class="bvs">Exo_13:5</span>; <span class="bvs">Exo_33:3</span>; <span class="bvs">Lev_20:24</span>) The land was no doubt from the beginning very fertile; but it is probable that it became more fruitful after the people entered into it, for it was in a manner renewed; and it was God’s design to shew in a visible manner how great; Was the efficacy of his covenant. It was not then to no purpose that Moses said so often that it was a land flowing with milk and honey. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>According as </em>it is <em>at this day </em>He produces witnesses; as though he had said, “God has dealt faithfully with you, for he has performed the faith pledged to your fathers, and has fulfined his oath: but now since ye have polluted this land, and the memory of God’s favor is as it were buried among you, and ye even tread under your feet his law — since then such great impiety averts his blessing from you, what remains for him to do, but to drive you away into exile?” We hence see that there is here to be understood an implied threatening, when he says that God had performed what he had promised to the fathers, and promised with this condition — that they were to obey his commands. </p><p>We have already spoken of the Prophet’s answer. When he answered, Amen, he did not wait for what the people would say; for the greater part no doubt made a clamor and sought to make shifts with God. So great was their effrontery, that they often rose up insolently against the Prophets. Then as he knew that they were so refractory, he subscribed to the curse in his own name. It follows — </p><p><strong>(33)</strong> “Establish — <span class="lang el-gr">στήσω</span>,” is the <em>Septuagint; </em>“awaken — suscitem,” is the <em>Vulgate; </em>“perform,” is the <em>Syriac; </em>“confirm,” is the <em>Targum. </em>“To make to stand” is the literal meaning of the verb. Hence the most correct word is “confirm.” The connection of this verse is not with the immediately preceding words, but with “Hearken” and “do,” etc., at the middle of the former verse. Hearken and do, that I may confirm the oath, etc. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
