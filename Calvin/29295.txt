<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And be renewed. </em>The second part of the rule for a devout and holy life is to live, not in our own spirit, but in the Spirit of Christ. But what is meant by — <em>the spirit of your mind? </em>I understand it simply to mean, — <em>Be renewed, </em>not only with respect to the inferior appetites or desires, which are manifestly sinful, but with respect also to that part of the soul which is reckoned most noble and excellent. And here again, he brings forward to view that Queen which philosophers are accustomed almost to adore. There is an implied contrast between <em>the spirit of our mind </em>and the Divine and heavenly Spirit, who produces in us another and a new mind. How much there is in us that is sound or uncorrupted may be easily gathered from this passage, which enjoins us to correct chiefly the reason or <em>mind, </em>in which we are apt to imagine that there is nothing but what is virtuous and deserves commendation. </p></div>
