<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Go; because he is an elect instrument. </em>The commandment repeated the second time, and also the promise of success added, taketh away all doubtfulness. Therefore sloth shall want an excuse, if it be never redressed after that many pricks be used; like as we see that very many, who howsoever the Lord cry unto them continually, do not only loiter during their whole life, but do also cherish their slothfulness by all means possible. <span class="cite-ref">(594)</span> If any man object that the Lord speaketh not at this day in a vision, I answer, that forasmuch as the Scripture is abundantly confirmed to us, we must hear God thence. <span class="cite-ref">(595)</span></p><p><em>A vessel of election, </em>or, as Erasmus translateth it, <em>an elect instrument, </em>is taken for an excellent minister. The word <em>instrument </em>doth show that men can do nothing, save inasmuch as God useth their industry at his pleasure. For if we be instruments, he alone is the author; the force and power to do is in his power alone. And that which Christ speaketh in this place of Paul appertaineth to all men, both one and other. Therefore how stoutly soever every man labor, and how carefully soever he behave himself in his duty, yet there is no cause why he should challenge to himself any part of praise. Those which dispute subtilely about the word <em>vessel, </em>dote through ignorance of the Hebrew tongue. Luke putteth the genitive ease for the dative and that according to the common custom of the Hebrew tongue. And he meant to express a certain excellency, as if he should have said, that this man shall be no common minister of Christ, but shall be indued with singular excellency above others. Nevertheless, we must note that if any thing be excellent, it dependeth upon the favor of God, as Paul himself teacheth elsewhere. Who is he that separateth thee? to wit, that thou shouldst excel others, (<span class="bvs">1Co_4:7</span>.) To conclude, Christ pronounceth that Paul was chosen unto great and excellent things. </p><p><em>To bear my name amongst the Gentiles. </em>To him who went about before to suppress the name of Christ is the same now committed to be borne. If we please to take <span class="lang he-il">שנם</span> (<em>schenos</em>) for a<em>vessel</em>, this should be a continual metaphor, because a minister of the gospel serveth instead of a vessel to publish the name of Christ; but because it signifieth rather amongst the Hebrews any instrument generally, I take these words<em>to carry my name</em>, for to extol the same unto due honor. For Christ is placed after a sort in his princely throne when as the world is brought under his power by the preaching of the gospel. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(594)</span> “Quibus possunt blanditiis,” by all sorts of blandishment. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(595)</span> “Quo magis notandum est Anniae exemplum, qui ad secundum mandatum moras omnes abrumpit.” Wherefore it is the more necessary to give heed to the example of Ananias, who, on the second command, breaks off all delay, omitted. </p></div></div>
