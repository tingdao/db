<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Then came the children of Israel. </em>In the twenty-third chapter of this book many intermediate stations are mentioned, which are not here referred to: perhaps because, from the time that God compelled them to draw back, <em>they </em>had made no advance for thirty whole years, but had wandered about by circuitous paths. In connecting the history, therefore, in this place he relates that they passed from the desert of Paran to the desert of Sin; because they then began to direct their journey straight towards the land of Canaan, and to advance more closely to it, so as at length to conclude their wanderings. When he tells us that Miriam died here, we may infer from hence that her life was greatly prolonged. It is probable that she was a girl of ten or twelve years of age, when Moses was born, since she was able to provide adroitly for his safety, (<span class="bvs">Exo_2:4</span>;) for although her name is not actually given, yet it may be reasonably supposed that she was the person who fetched her mother to nurse the child that had been exposed. She reached the age, then, of about 130 years, <span class="cite-ref">(107)</span> an unusual length of life, and especially for a woman. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(107)</span> “Ainsi elle a passe six vingts ans;” thus she was more than six-score years of age. — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
