<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Beware that thou forget not </em><span class="cite-ref">(263)</span> We may easily estimable the necessity of this admonition from the common corruption of human nature, which is even yet only too general and too influential; for scarcely shall we find one person in a hundred in whom satiety does not generate headiness. Moses will hereafter speak in his Song of the rebelliousness of this people, <span class="cite-ref">(264)</span></p><p>“The beloved, <em>(Jeshurun,) </em>waxen fat, and grown thick, kicked.” (<span class="bvs">Deu_32:15</span>.) </p><p>It was needful, then, that a restraint should be put on such refractory beings, nay, that they should have their wantonness still more tightly repressed in their prosperity. But we may, and it is well to, extend this doctrine to ourselves also, since prosperity intoxicates almost all of us, so that we intemperately grow wanton against God, and forget ourselves and Him. Therefore Moses not only commands the Israelites not to be ungrateful to God, but warns them to <em>guard </em>themselves (for he uses this word for to <em>beware) </em>from that impious ingratitude. He immediately after uses this same word for the keeping of the Law. But this is the sum, that they needed the utmost care and attention to beware lest forgetfulness of God should steal over them in happy circumstances, and thus they should shake off His fear, and cast away His yoke, and indulge themselves in the lusts of their flesh. For he shews that contempt of the Law would be a token of ingratitude; because it could not be but that they would submit themselves to God, and keep His Law, if they only reflected that it was to nothing but His blessing that they owed their prosperity. We have already observed elsewhere that his designation of the Law by various terms amounts to a commendation of its perfect doctrine; as much as to say, that no part of right conduct is omitted in it. He also asserts here (as often elsewhere) the faithfulness of his ministry, lest they should shufflingly contend that, whilst they refuse the commands of a mortal man, they are not therefore rebellious against God. He says, then, that their piety will not be acceptable to God, unless they keep the Law propounded by Him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(263)</span> Take heed to thyself —<em>Lat. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(264)</span> “LXX. autem pro eo (Jeshurun) substituerunt <span class="lang el-gr">ὀ ἠγαπημένος</span>, et <em>V. </em>imitatur per suum <em>Dilectus. </em>Unde autem sit illa versio, vix explicari video; fatente etiam Steucho, se nescire a quo verbo id nomen duct possit si Dilectum significat,” <em>etc. </em>— <em>Marckius on </em><span class="bvs">Deu_32:0</span><em> : </em>C.’s own translation of the word is <em>Rectus. </em></p></div></div>
