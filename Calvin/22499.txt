<div class="comment-content"><p>Now as to what he says, <em>I will command the serpent to bite them, </em>some understand by <span class="lang he-il">נחש</span>, <em>nuchesh, </em>not a serpent on hand, but the whale, or some other marine animal, as the leviathan, which is mentioned in Scripture; and we may learn from other parts of Scripture that “nachash” means not only a serpent, but also a whale or some animal living in the sea. In a word, God intimates, that he would be armed everywhere, whenever he should resolve to punish his adversaries, and that in all elements are means in readiness, by which he can destroy the wicked, who seek to escape from his hand. </p></div>
