<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Jehovah sitteth upon the flood. </em>Some think that David here alludes to that memorable instance of God’s vengeance, when he drowned the world at once by the flood, <span class="cite-ref">(618)</span> and thus testified to all ages that he is the judge of mankind. I agree to this in part, but extend his meaning still farther. In my opinion, he prosecutes the former subject, putting us in mind that those floods, which still threaten destruction to the earth, are controlled by the providence of God in such a way, as to make it evident that it is he alone who governs all things at all times. <span class="cite-ref">(619)</span> David, therefore, mentions this among other proofs of God’s power, that even when the elements appear to be mingled and confounded together by the utmost fury of the weather, God controls and moderates these commotions from his throne in heaven. He accordingly adds, for the sake of explanation, <em>God sits King for ever. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(618)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par le deluge</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em>This is the view taken of the passage by the ancient versions. “God,” says the Chaldee, “in the generation of the deluge sat in judgment.” The Septuagint reads, “God shall make the deluge to be inhabited,” or “make the world habitable after it;" the Syriac, “God called back the deluge;” and the Arabic, “God restrained the deluge.” <em>Ainsworth </em>reads, “Jehovah sat at the flood,” and explains it as meaning “Noah’s flood.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(619)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que c’est luy seul qui gouverne toutes choses en tout temps</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
