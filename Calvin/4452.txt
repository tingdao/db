<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob! </em>The internal condition of prosperity enjoyed by the people is described by various similitudes akin to each other, and expressive of the same thing. He compares them to valleys and well-watered gardens, and then to trees which were rendered succulent by abundance of moisture, and finally to fields whose seeds imbibe fatness from the waters. The word we translate “<em>valleys </em>spread forth,” some prefer to render “streams;” and the Hebrew word signifies both; but the course of the metaphors requires that valleys should be rather understood. For the same reason I have given the translation “aloe-trees;” for, although the word <span class="lang he-il">אהלים</span><em>ohelim, </em>often means “tabernacles,” I have no doubt but that it here refers to trees, so as to correspond with what follows as to the cedars. They are called trees “which the Lord hath planted,” as surpassing the ordinary growth of nature in their peculiar excellency, and exhibiting something more noble than the effect of human labor and skill. </p><p>In the concluding similitude the interpreters have erred, in nay opinion. Some translate it, “His seed (<em>is</em>) many waters;” others, “on many waters;” but <span class="cite-ref">(170)</span> the literal translation which I have given runs far better, viz., that he is like a rich and fertile field, whose seed is steeped in much water. </p><p>Thus far Balaam has been speaking of God’s blessing, which shall enrich the people with an abundance of all good things. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(170)</span> Ainsworth says: “This<em>seed </em>may be understood, as before, of children; and <em>many waters, </em>of many peoples, as in <span class="bvs">Rev_17:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Isa_57:19</span>; <span class="bvs">Psa_144:7</span>. Or <em>seed </em>may mean <em>corn </em>sown in watery, moist, and fruitful places, to bring forth much increase; as <span class="bvs">Isa_32:20</span>.” <em>C.’s </em>own translation is, after all, equivocal; however, his opinion may incline to the literal meaning of the word <em>seed. </em></p></div></div>
