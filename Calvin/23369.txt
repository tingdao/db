<div class="comment-content"><p>As we shall soon meet again with the mention of a lake, where it is said (<span class="bvs">Mat_8:33</span>) that the swine were carried into it with violence, it is not universally agreed whether one and the same lake is mentioned in both places. The waters of Gennesareth, all admit, <span class="cite-ref">(536)</span> were pleasant and healthful to drink: but the Gadarene lake, Strabo tells us, was so unwholesome and pestilential, that the cattle which drank of it often lost their hair and their hoofs. There is therefore no doubt that there were two separate lakes, and that they were at a considerable distance from each other. There is as little doubt that the lake mentioned here was the lake of Gennesareth; and that Christ, having crossed it, came to the Gadarenes, whom Matthew calls <em>Geresenes, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_8:28</span>.) </p><p>Those who infer, from the diversity of the names, that the narratives are different, through a desire to be thought very acute, fall under the charge of gross ignorance: for the country of the Gergesenes was also called Gadarene, from a celebrated city, Gadara. In the age of Jerome, the name was changed; and, therefore, in accordance with the prevailing custom, he calls them <em>Geraseaes </em>That it was the Gadarene lake into which the swine were thrown down by the devils, I have no hesitation in admitting: but when Christ says, <em>let us cross to the other side, </em>I cannot explain the reference as made to any other lake than that of Gennesareth. </p><p>It remains that we now inquire as to the time, which cannot be learned either from Matthew or from Luke. Mark alone mentions that it was the evening of that day on which Christ discoursed about the preaching of the gospel under the parable of the sower. Hence it is evident, that they did not attend to the order of time; and, indeed, this is expressly stated by Luke, when he says that <em>it happened on a certain day: </em>for these words show that he gives himself little concern as to the question which of the events was earlier or later. </p><p><span class="bvs">Mat_8:23</span><strong>.</strong><em>And when he had entered into a ship </em>Mark says that <em>other little ships </em>crossed <em>along with him: </em>but that Christ entered into his own ship <em>with his disciples </em>Luke too quotes his words: Matthew is more concise. They agree, however, as to the leading fact, that Christ laid himself down to rest, and that, while he was asleep, a tempest suddenly arose. First, it is certain that the storm which agitated the lake was not accidental: for how would God have permitted his Son to be driven about at random by the violence of the waves? But on this occasion he intended to make known to the apostles how weak and inconsiderable their faith still was. Though Christ’s sleep was natural, yet it served the additional purpose of making the disciples better acquainted with their weakness. I will not say, as many do, that Christ pretended sleep, in order to try them. On the contrary, I think that he was asleep in such a manner as the condition and necessity of human nature required. </p><p>And yet his divinity watched over him, so that the apostles had no reason to fear that consolation would not be immediately provided, or that assistance would not be obtained from heaven. Let us therefore conclude, that all this was arranged by the secret providence of God, — that Christ was asleep, that a violent tempest arose, and that the waves covered the ship, which was in imminent danger of perishing. And let us learn hence that, whenever any adverse occurrence takes place, the Lord tries our faith. If the distresses grow to such a height as almost to overwhelm us, let us believe that God does it with the same design of exercising our patience, or of bringing to light in this way our hidden weakness; as we see that, when the apostles were covered by the billows, <span class="cite-ref">(537)</span> their weakness, which formerly lay concealed, was discovered. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(536)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C'est un poinct bien resolu entre tous ceux qui ont escrit</span>;” — “it is a point well agreed among all who have written.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(537)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand les Apostres se sont trouvez assaillis et quasi couvers des riots du lac</span>;” — “when the Apostles found themselves assaulted, and, as it were, covered by the waves of the lake.” </p></div></div>
