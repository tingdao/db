<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also </em>He adds nothing new, but confirms by repetition what He had just said, in order to remove all doubt. Still He declares that He is induced by no other reason than by the gratuitous favor wherewith He had embraced Moses. This, therefore, is a kind of renewal of the Covenant, when the people is consecrated to God, so as to recover again the sacerdotal kingdom. </p></div>
