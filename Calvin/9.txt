<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Let the waters... be gathered together </em>This also is an illustrious miracle, that the waters by their departure have given a dwelling-place to men. For even philosophers allow that the natural position of the waters was to cover the whole earth, as Moses declares they did in the beginning; first, because being an element, it must be circular, and because this element is heavier than the air, and lighter than the earth, it ought cover the latter in its whole circumference. <span class="cite-ref">(64)</span> But that the seas, being gathered together as on heaps, should give place for man, is seemingly preternatural; and therefore Scripture often extols the goodness of God in this particular. See <span class="bvs">Psa_33:7</span>, </p><p>‘He has gathered the waters together on a heap, <LineBreak />and has laid them up in his treasures.’ </p><p>Also <span class="bvs">Psa_78:13</span>, </p><p>‘He has collected the waters as into a bottle.’ <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span></p><p><span class="bvs">Jer_5:22</span>, </p><p>‘Will ye not fear me? will ye not tremble at my presence, <LineBreak />who have placed the sand as the boundary of the sea?’ </p><p><span class="bvs">Job_38:8</span>, </p><p>‘Who has shut up the sea with doors? Have not I surrounded it with gates and bars? <LineBreak />I have said, <LineBreak />Hitherto shalt thou proceed; here shall thy swelling waves be broken.’ </p><p>Let us, therefore, know that we are dwelling on dry ground, because God, by his command, has removed the waters that they should not overflow the whole earth. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(64)</span> This reasoning is to be explained by reference to the philosophical theories of the age. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(65)</span> “Velut in utrem;” “from the Vulgate.” The English version is, “He made the waters to stand as an heap.” </p></div></div>
