<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>The lust of the flesh</em>, or, <em>namely, the lust of the flesh</em>. The old interpreter renders the verse otherwise, for from one sentence he makes two. Those Greek authors do better, who read these words together, “Whatever is in the world is not of God;” and then the three kinds of lusts they introduce parenthetically. For John, by way of explanation, inserted these three particulars as examples, that he might briefly shew what are the pursuits and thoughts of men who live for the world; but whether it be a full and complete division, it does not signify much; though you will not find a worldly man in whom these lusts do not prevail, at least one of them. It remains for us to see what he understands by each of these. </p><p>The first clause is commonly explained of all sinful lusts in general; for the flesh means the whole corrupt nature of man. Though I am unwilling to contend, yet I am unwilling to dissemble that I approve of another meaning. Paul, when forbidding, in <span class="bvs">Rom_13:14</span>, to make provision for the flesh as to its lusts, seems to me to be the best interpreter of this place. What, then, is the flesh there? even the body and all that belongs to it. What, then, is the lust or desire of the flesh, but when worldly men, seeking to live softly and delicately, are intent only on their own advantages? Well known from Cicero and others, is the threefold division made by Epicurus; for he made this difference between lusts; he made some natural and necessary, some natural and not necessary, and some neither natural nor necessary. But John, well knowing the insubordination (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀταξία</span>)of the human heart unhesitantly condemns the lust of the flesh, because it always flows out immoderately, and never observes any due medium. He afterwards comes gradually to grosser vices. </p><p><em>The lust of the eyes </em>He includes, as I think, libidinous looks as well as the vanity which delights in pomps and empty splendor. </p><p>In the last place follows <em>pride </em>or <em>haughtiness</em>; with which is connected ambition, boasting, contempt of others, blind love of self, headstrong self-confidence. </p><p>The sum of the whole is, that as soon as the world presents itself, our lusts or desires, when our heart is corrupt, are captivated by it, like unbridled wild beasts; so that various lusts, all which are adverse to God, bear rule in us. The Greek word, <span class="lang el-gr">βὶος</span> rendered life, (<em>vita </em>,) means the way or manner of living. </p></div>
