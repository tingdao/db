<div class="comment-content"><p>He says that God had commanded him to <em>write in a book all the words </em>which he had heard; and the reason follows, <em>For, behold, come shall the days, saith Jehovah, in which I will restore the captivity of my people Israel and Judah </em><span class="cite-ref">(2)</span> There is to be understood a contrast between the restoration mentioned here and that of which the false prophets had prattled when they animated the people with the hope of a return in a short time; for, as I have said, that false expectation, when the Jews sought unseasonably to return to their own country, was a sort of mental inebriety. But when they found that they had been deceived, despair only remained for them. Hence the Prophet recalls them here to a quietness of mind, even that they might know that God would prove faithful after they found out that they had rashly embraced what impostors had of themselves <em>proclaimed </em>We then see that there is here an implied comparison between the sure and certain deliverance which God had promised, and the false and stolid hope with which the people had been inebriated: <em>come, </em>then, <em>shall the days </em>Now it appears that two years had taken away every expectation; for they believed the false prophets who said that God would restore them in two years; after the end of that time all the hope of the people failed. Therefore the Prophet here removes that erroneous impression which had been made on their minds, and he says that <em>the days </em>would <em>come </em>in which God would redeem his people; and thus he indirectly derides the folly of the people, and condemns the impiety of those who had dared to promise so quick a return. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(2)</span> The words literally are, “For behold the days coming, saith Jehovah, when I shall restore the migration of my people, Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will restore them to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall inherit it.” To render <span class="lang he-il">ו</span><em>when, </em>when preceded by a participle, is what may be done, and ought, in my view, to be commonly done. The word <span class="lang he-il">שבות</span> means a migration, as given in the <em>Targum, </em>rather than captivity. It is rendered by the <em>Sept. </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἀποικία</span>, removal from home. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
