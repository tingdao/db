<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Because of the spoiling of the needy. </em>David now sets before himself as matter of consolation, the truth that God will not suffer the wicked thus to make havoc without end and measure. The more effectually to establish himself and others in the belief of this truth, he introduces God himself as speaking. The expression is more emphatic when God is represented as coming forward and declaring with his own mouth that he is come to deliver the poor and distressed. There is also great emphasis in the adverb <em>now, </em>by which God intimates that, although our safety is in his hand, and, therefore, in secure keeping, yet he does not immediately grant deliverance from affliction; for his words imply that he had hitherto been, as it were, lying still and asleep, until he was awakened by the calamities and the cries of his people. When, therefore, the injuries, the extortions, and the devastations of our enemies leave us nothing but tears and groans, let us remember that now the time is at hand when God intends to rise up to execute judgment. This doctrine should also serve to produce in us patience, and prevent us from taking it ill, that we are reckoned among the number of the poor and afflicted, whose cause God promises to take into his own hand. </p><p>With respect to the meaning of the second clause of the verse, expositors differ. According to some, <em>to set in safety, </em>means the same thing as <em>to give or bring safety, </em>as if the letter <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>,<em>beth, </em>which signifies <em>in, </em>were superfluous. But the language rather contains a promise to grant to those who are unjustly oppressed, full restitution. What follows is attended with more difficulty. The word <span class="lang he-il">פוה</span>,<em>phuach, </em>which we have rendered <em>to lay snares for, </em>sometimes signifies <em>to blow out, </em>or <em>to puff, </em>— at other times <em>to ensnare, </em>or <em>to lay snares for; </em>and sometimes, also, to <em>speak. </em>Those who think it is here put for <em>to speak </em>also differ among themselves with respect to the meaning. Some render it <em>God will speak to himself; </em>that is to say, God will determine with himself; but as the Psalmist had already declared the determination of God, this would be an unnecessary and vain repetition. Others refer it to the language of the godly, as if David introduced them speaking one to another concerning the faithfulness and stability of the promises of God; for with this word they connect the following sentence, <em>The words of the Lord are pure words, etc </em>But this view is even more strained than the preceding. The opinion of others, who suppose, that to the determination of God <em>to arise, </em>there is subjoined the language which is addressed to the godly, is more admissible. It would not be sufficient for God to determine with himself what he would do for our safety, if he did not speak to us expressly, and by name. It is only when God makes us to understand, by his own voice, that he will be gracious to us, that we can entertain the hope of salvation. God, it is true, speaks also to unbelievers, but without producing any good effect, seeing they are deaf; just as when he treats them with gentleness and liberality, it is without effect, because they are stupid, and devour his benefits without any sense of their coming from him. But as I perceive that under the word <span class="lang he-il">יאמר</span>,<em>yomar, will say, </em>the promises of God may be suitably and properly comprehended, to avoid a repetition of the same thing, I adopt without hesitation the sense of the last clause, which I have given in the translation, namely, that God declares he will arise to restore to safety those who seem on all sides to be environed by the snares of their enemies, and even caught in them. The import of the language is this: The ungodly may hold the poor and afflicted entangled in their snares as a prey which they have caught; but I will set them in safety. If it should be replied, that the reading in the Hebrew is not <em>for whom, </em>but <em>for him, </em>I would observe, that it is no new thing for these words, <em>him, for him, </em>to be used instead of <em>whom </em>and <em>for whom. </em><span class="cite-ref">(264)</span> If any one prefer the sense of <em>puffing at, </em>I am not disposed greatly to oppose him. According to this reading, David would elegantly taunt the pride of the ungodly, who confidently imagine they can do any thing, <span class="cite-ref">(265)</span> even with their breath, as we have seen in the tenth psalm, at the fifth verse. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(264)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et quant a ce qu’on pourroit repliequer qu’il n’y a pas en l’Hebrieu A qui, mais Luy, ce n’est pas chose nouvelle que ces mots Le, Luy se prenent pour Qui et A qui</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(265)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’ils renverseront tout k soufiler seulement</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “That they shall overthrow all simply by their breath.” </p></div></div>
