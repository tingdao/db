<div class="comment-content"><p>Albeit in God’s sight there is no difference between bond and free, yet their condition is diverse as regards courts of justice; <span class="cite-ref">(70)</span> nor do the same evil consequences ensue from adultery with a bond-maid, (as with a free woman.) <span class="cite-ref">(71)</span> Notwithstanding, therefore, that the crime is worthy of death, still, in consideration of the people’s infirmity, the punishment is mitigated, so that, if a person shall have corrupted a betrothed bond-maid, both shall be scourged. <span class="cite-ref">(72)</span> From hence we infer that, if a concubine, who had already cohabited with a man, were seduced, it was accounted a capital adultery. Lest it should be falsely held, from the lenity or indulgence of the law, that the offense was a trifling one, this error is at once anticipated by the addition of the expiation: for, if one already beaten with stripes still required reconciliation, it follows that the measure of the offense is not to be estimated by its penalty. </p><p><strong>(70)</strong> “Quant aux jugemens terreins, et humains.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(71)</strong> Added from <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(72)</strong><em>C</em>. ’s Latin version and Commentary agree here with the margin of, <em>A.
