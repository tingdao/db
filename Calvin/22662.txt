<div class="comment-content"><p>God, after having declared that he would be the Judge of the people, speaks now more clearly of their punishment. He says therefore that he was armed with vengeance: for it often happens, when a judge, even one who hates wickedness, is not able to punish, for he dreads the fierceness of those whom he thinks himself unequal to restrain. Hence God intimates here, that there will not be wanting to him a power to punish the people, <em>I will afflict thee, </em>he says, <em>by striking </em>or wounding<em>thee; </em>for so some render the words. <span class="cite-ref">(176)</span> The sum of what is said is, — that nothing would be an obstacle to prevent God from inflicting punishment on the people, for there would be no want of power in his case. There is therefore no reason for men to promise themselves any escape when God ascends his tribunal; for were they fortified by all possible means they could not ward off the hand of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(176)</span><em>Newcome </em>renders this line differently, — </p><p>Wherefore I will begin go smite thee. </p><p>Following a few MSS. And the Septuagint, he takes the verb here to be <span class="lang he-il">החלתי</span>, which means, to begin; but the rendering seems flat, and suits not the passage; and it is not true, for the Lord has often smitten them before. The verb is in the past tense, and this has created a difficulty. The verbs in the following verse, which is connected with this, are all in the future tense, referring to a coming judgment. To remove this difficulty I propose the following version, — </p><p><em>But even I, </em>who<em>have made </em>thee<em>to grieve by striking thee, </em><em><LineBreak /></em>Will<em>make </em>thee<em>wholly desolate on account of thy sins: </em></p><p>Then the threatened desolation is specified. The verb <span class="lang he-il">השמם</span>, making desolate, is evidently a participle connected with <span class="lang he-il">אני</span> I, at the beginning of the verse, the rest being an intervening clause: and when a participle follows a nominative case, which often occurs in Hebrew, the auxiliary verb must be supplied in a translation, which in its tense must be regulated by the context, and here by the verse which follows. <em>Piscator </em>renders it <em>Desolabo </em><em>, </em>and says, that it is an infinitive put for the future. Grief or sorrow had already been produced, but now entire desolation is threatened. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
