<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>And your feet shod. </em>The allusion, if I mistake not, is to the military <em>greaves; </em>for they were always reckoned a part of the armor, and were even used for domestic purposes. As soldiers covered their legs and feet to protect them against cold and other injuries, so we must be shod <em>with the gospel, </em>if we would pass unhurt through the world. It is <em>the gospel of peace, </em>and it is so called, as every reader must perceive, from its effects; for it is the message of our reconciliation to God, and nothing else gives peace to the conscience. But what is the meaning of the word <em>preparation? </em>Some explain it as an injunction to be <em>prepared </em>for the gospel; but it is the effect of the gospel which I consider to be likewise expressed by this term. We are enjoined to lay aside every hinderance, and to be prepared both for journey and for war. By nature we dislike exertion, and want agility. A rough road and many other obstacles retard our progress, and we are discouraged by the smallest annoyance. On these accounts, Paul holds out the gospel as the fittest means for undertaking and performing the expedition. Erasmus proposes a circumlocution, (<em>ut sitis parati </em>,) <em>that ye may be prepared; </em>but this does not appear to convey the true meaning. </p></div>
