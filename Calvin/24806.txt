<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_14:51</span><strong>.</strong><em>And a young man. </em>How some persons have come to dream that this was John <span class="cite-ref">(221)</span> I know not, nor is it of much importance to inquire. The chief point is, to ascertain for what purpose Mark has related this transaction. I think that his object was, to inform us that those wicked men — as usually happens in riotous assemblies stormed and raved without shame or modesty; which appeared from their seizing <em>a young man </em>who was unknown to them, and not suspected of any crime, so that he had difficulty in escaping out of their hands <em>naked. </em>For it is probable that <em>the young man, </em>who is mentioned, had some attachment to Christ, and, on hearing the tumult by night, without stopping to put on his clothes, and covered only with a linen garment, came either to discover their traps, or, at least, that he might not be wanting in a duty of friendship. <span class="cite-ref">(222)</span> We certainly perceive — as I just now said — that those wicked men raged with cruel violence, when they did not even spare a poor <em>young man, </em>who had left his bed, almost <em>naked, </em>and run, on hearing the noise. </p><p><strong>(221)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Aucuns ont songé que c’estoit Jean, l’un des Apostres</span>;” — “some have dreamed that it was John, one of the Apostles.” </p><p><strong>(222)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ou, pour le moins à fin de faire devoir d’ami envers Jesus Christ</span>;” — “or, at least, in order to perform the duty of a friend towards Jesus Christ.” </p></div>
