<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>43.</strong><em>How then does David by the Spirit call him Lord. </em>The assertion made by Christ, that <em>David </em>spoke <em>by the Spirit, </em>is emphatic; for he contrasts the prediction of a future event with the testimony of a present event. By this phrase he anticipates the sophistry by which the Jews of the present day attempt to escape. They allege that this prediction celebrates the reign of <em>David, </em>as if, representing God to be the Author of his reign, <em>David </em>would rise above the mad attempts of his enemies, and affirmed that they would gain nothing by opposing the will of God. That <em>the scribes </em>might not shelter themselves under such an objection, Christ began with stating that the psalm was not composed in reference to the person of <em>David, </em>but was dictated <em>by the </em>prophetic <em>Spirit </em>to describe the future reign of Christ; as it may easily be learned even from the passage itself, that what we read there does not apply either to <em>David, </em>or to any other earthly king; for there <em>David </em>introduces a king clothed with a new priesthood, by which the ancient shadows of the Law must be abolished, (<span class="bvs">Psa_110:4</span>) </p><p>We must now see how he proves that Christ will hold a higher rank than to be merely descended from the seed of <em>David. </em>It is because <em>David, </em>who was king and head of the people, <em>calls him Lord; </em>from which it follows, that there is something in him greater than man. But the argument appears to be feeble and inconclusive; for it may be objected that, when <em>David </em>gave the psalm to the people to sing, without having any view to his own person, he assigned to Christ dominion over others. But to this I reply that, as he was one of the members of the Church, nothing would have been more improper than to shut himself out from the common doctrine. Here he enjoins all the children of God to boast, as with one voice, that they are safe through the protection of a heavenly and invincible King. If he be separated from the body of the Church, he will not partake of the salvation promised through Christ. If this were the voice of a few persons, the dominion of Christ would not extend even to <em>David. </em>But now neither he, nor any other person, can be excluded from subjection to him, without cutting himself off from the hope of eternal salvation. Since then there was nothing better for <em>David </em>than to be included in the Church, it was not less for himself than for the rest of the people that <em>David </em>composed this psalm. In short, by this title Christ is pronounced to be supreme and sole King, who holds the preeminence among all believers; and no exception ought to be allowed to ranking all in one class, when he is appointed to be the Redeemer of the Church. There can be no doubt, therefore, that David represents himself also as a subject of his government, so as to be reckoned one of the number of the people of God. </p><p>But now another question arises: Might not God have raised up one whom he appointed from among mankind to be a Redeemer, so as to be <em>David’s Lord, </em>though <em>he was his son? </em>For here it is not the essential name of God, but only <em>Adonai </em><span class="cite-ref">(83)</span> that is employed, and this term is frequently applied to men. I reply: Christ takes for granted that he who is taken out of the number of men, and raised to such a rank of honor, as to be the supreme Head of the whole Church, is not a mere man, but possesses also the majesty of God. For the eternal God, who by an oath makes this claim for himself, that </p><p>before him every knee shall bow, (<span class="bvs">Isa_45:23</span>,) </p><p>at the same time swears that </p><p>he will not give his glory to another, (<span class="bvs">Isa_42:8</span>.) </p><p>But, according to the testimony of Paul, when Christ was raised to kingly power, </p><p>there was given to him a name which is above every name, that before him every knee should bow, (<span class="bvs">Rom_14:11</span>; <span class="bvs">Phi_2:9</span>.) </p><p>And though Paul had never said this, yet such is the fact, that Christ is above <em>David </em>and other holy kings, because he also ranks higher than angels; which would not apply to a created man, unless he were also </p><p>God manifested in the flesh, (<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:16</span>.) </p><p>I do acknowledge that his divine essence is not expressed directly and in so many words; but it may easily be inferred that He is God, who is placed above all creatures. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(83)</span> Our authorized version of <span class="bvs">Psa_110:1</span> runs thus: The Lord said unto my Lord. While the word Lord occurs twice in this clause, the Translators have followed their ordinary method of printing the first in small capitals, to present it to the eye of the reader as standing for the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">יהוה</span>, (<em>Jehovah</em>,) which our Author calls “the essential name of God,” while the second stands for (<span class="lang he-il">אדני</span>), (<em>Adonai</em>,) <em>my Lord, </em>which, as he also mentions, “is frequently applied to men.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
