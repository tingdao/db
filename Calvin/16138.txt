<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>All who hate Zion shall be confounded, and tutored backward. </em>Whether we take this as a prayer or a promise, the Prophet has a respect to the time to come. Since all the verbs are in the future tense, it is certainly a very appropriate interpretation to understand him as deriving from times past instruction as to what is to be hoped for in future, even to the end. In whichever way we understand the passage, he declares that the faithful have no reason to be discouraged when they behold their enemies raised on high. The grass which grows upon the house-tops is not, on account of its higher situation, more valuable than the blade of corn which in the low ground is trampled under foot; for although it stands elevated above men’s heads, it is, in the first place, unprofitable; and secondly, it quickly withers away. <span class="cite-ref">(114)</span> The verb, <strong>ףלש</strong>, <em>shalaph, </em><span class="cite-ref">(115)</span> which we have translate <em>comes forth, </em>is by some rendered, <em>is plucked up. </em>According to this translation the sense is, that without the hand or labor of man the grass on the house-tops is dried up. But as the verb properly signifies <em>to be brought forth, </em>or <em>to come forth, </em>the meaning, in my opinion, is that the grass on the housetops, so far from continuing long in a state of freshness, withers and perishes at its first springing up, because it has no root under it, nor earth to supply it with sap or moisture for its nourishment. Whenever, then, the splendor or greatness of our enemies strikes us with fear, let us bring to our recollection this comparison, that as the grass which grows upon the house-tops, though high, is yet without root, and consequently of brief duration, so these enemies, the nearer they approach the sun by the height of their pride, shall be the sooner consumed by the burning heat, since they have no root, it being humility alone which draws life and vigor from God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(114)</span> “In Judea, the roofs of the houses are flat, and covered with cement. On this the grass would not uncommonly grow: but, being thin and weak, and its situation hot and exposed, it was speedily ‘dried up and withered.’ The same sort of architecture, and the same appearances, are common in the East at this day.” —<em>Warner. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(115)</span><span class="lang he-il">שלף</span> differently interpreted. By the greater number of persons it is translated, <em>to extract, to pull out; </em>and thus it is used in <span class="bvs">Rut_4:7</span>, and <span class="bvs">Joh_20:25</span>, ‘Before any one extracts the grass it withereth.’ The Septuagint has <span class="lang el-gr">πρὸ τοῦ εκσπασθὢναι</span>, and the Vulgate, ‘priusquam evellatur.’ Our translators have rendered <span class="lang he-il">שקדמת שלף</span>, ‘afore it groweth up,’ in which they are supported by Aquila and Symmachus. Theodoret observes that many MSS. of the Septuagint have <span class="lang el-gr">ἐξανθὢναι</span> for <span class="lang el-gr">ἐκσπασθὢναι</span>. In either case the sense is, that the haters of Zion shall be exterminated by the just and wonderful judgments of God, before they have time to accomplish their wicked <em>intentions. </em>” —<em>Phillips. </em>“Parkhurst adopts Harmer’s opinion, that the Hebrew verb in this place signifies, ‘to push out, unsheath, as corn its ear.’ It appears nowhere else but in the sense of ‘unsheathing a sword,’ or drawing off a shoe.’ The proper translation seems to be, ‘Which withereth before it unsheaths its ear.’ See Parkhurst on <span class="lang he-il">שלף</span>.” —<em>Mant. </em></p></div></div>
