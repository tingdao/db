<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Hidden mystery. </em>Here we have a commendation of the gospel — that it is a wonderful secret of God. It is not without good reason that Paul so frequently extols the gospel by bestowing upon it the highest commendations in his power; for he saw that it was </p><p>a stumblingblock to the Jews, and foolishness to the Greeks.<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_1:23</span>.) </p><p>We see also at this day, in what hatred it is held by hypocrites, and how haughtily it is contemned by the world. Paul, accordingly, with the view of setting aside judgments so unfair and perverse, extols in magnificent terms the dignity of the gospel as often as an opportunity presents itself, and for that purpose he makes use of various arguments, according to the connection of the passage. Here he calls it a <em>sublime secret</em>, which was <em>hid from ages and generations, </em>that is, from the beginning of the world, through so many revolutions of ages. <span class="cite-ref">(340)</span> Now, that it is of the gospel that he speaks, is evident from <span class="bvs">Rom_16:25</span>, <span class="bvs">Eph_3:9</span>, and other similar passages. </p><p>The reason, however, why it is so called, is demanded. Some, in consequence of Paul’s making express mention of the calling of the Gentiles, are of opinion, that the sole reason why it is so called is, that the Lord had, in a manner, contrary to all expectation, poured out his grace upon the Gentiles, whom he had appeared to have shut out for ever from participation in eternal life. Any one, however, that will examine the whole passage more narrowly, will perceive that this is the <em>third </em>reason, not the <em>only </em>one, in so far, I mean, as relates to the passage before us, and that other in the Romans, to which I have referred. For the <em>first </em>is — that whereas God had, previously to the advent of Christ, governed his Church under dark coverings, both of words and of ceremonies, he has suddenly shone forth in full brightness by means of the doctrine of the gospel. The <em>second </em>is — that whereas nothing was previously seen but external figures, Christ has been exhibited, bringing with him the full truth, which had lain concealed. The <em>third is</em>, what I have mentioned — that the whole world, which had up to this time been estranged from God, is called to the hope of salvation, and the same inheritance of eternal life is offered to all. An attentive consideration of these things constrains us to reverence and adore this <em>mystery </em>which Paul proclaims, however it may be held in contempt by the world, or even in derision. </p><p><em>Which is now revealed</em>. Lest any one should turn aside to another meaning the term <em>mystery, </em>as though he were speaking of a thing that was still secret and unknown, he adds, that it has now at length been published, <span class="cite-ref">(341)</span> that it might be known by mankind. What, therefore, was in its own nature secret, has been made manifest by the will of God. Hence, there is no reason why its obscurity should alarm us, after the revelation that God has made of it. He adds, however, <em>to the saints</em>, for <em>God </em>’<em>s arm </em>has not been <em>revealed to </em>all, (<span class="bvs">Isa_53:1</span>,) that they might understand his counsel. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(340)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’annees et sieclcs</span>;” — “Of years and ages.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(341)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Publié et manifesté</span>;” — “Published and manifested.” </p></div></div>
