<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And he looked on the Kenites. </em>I have not yet referred to the sense in which Balaam is said to have <em>seen </em>the Kenites, as well as the other nations; and now, also, I should refrain from doing so, if some did not attribute it to prophetical vision, in which opinion I cannot agree: for Moses relates as a matter of history that Balaam turned his face in the directions in which they respectively lived: and, although he did not actually see the people themselves, the sight of the place in which they dwelt was sufficient for the purpose of prophecy. </p><p>By the Kenites I understand the Midianites, who were contiguous to the Amalekites; for it is altogether unreasonable to refer the name to the descendants of Jethro. Forty years had not yet elapsed since Jethro had left his son with Moses; and his was only one small family in the wilderness of Midian, whereas mention is here made of a people already celebrated. Balaam, therefore, designates by <em>synecdoche </em>the Midianites, and devotes them also to the punishment they well deserved. Of this Gideon was in some measure the minister and executioner, when he routed their immense army with three hundred men; and his victory is celebrated in <span class="bvs">Psa_83:11</span>, and <span class="bvs">Isa_9:4</span>. It is probable that their power was broken at that time. </p></div>
