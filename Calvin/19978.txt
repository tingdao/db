<div class="comment-content"><p>It is added, that they <em>said, </em>as though they were ready to obey, <em>Let our prayer fall before thee. </em>This, as we have said, when addressed to God, is an <em>evidence </em>of humility; but it is applied here to man; and when the Hebrews make a humble request, they say, “Let my prayer fall before <em>thee,” </em>that is, Hear what I suppliantly and humbly ask. <em>Pray, </em>they said, <em>to Jehovah thy God for us </em>They called him the God of Jeremiah, not that they intended to exempt themselves from his authority; they did not mean that they were alienated from God; but in this way they extolled Jeremiah, and acknowledged him to be God’s true and lawful Prophet. In short, this saying refers to the prophetic office, as though they had said, that Jeremiah had hitherto confirmed his vocation, so that it was clearly evident that he had been sent from above. </p><p>We hence see why they called Jehovah the <em>God </em>of Jeremiah, not as though they had rejected God, and as though he was not their God in common with Jeremiah, but they allowed that the Prophet possessed a higher honor, and that his faithfulness and integrity were beyond controversy. </p><p>But this admission justly recoiled on their own head; for if Jeremiah was God’s Prophet, why did they not instantly obey him, after knowing that what he faithfully told them he had received from God? and why did they insolently and ferociously resist him and accuse him of falsehood? Their own admission then was not sincere, but a fallacious flattery, as is the case with all hypocrites, who never speak in sincerity and truth. </p><p>They afterwards added, <em>Pray for all this remnant, for we are left, a few from many </em>This they added to produce pity, in order that they might more easily obtain from Jeremiah what they asked; nor was that difficult; but as they felt conscious of wrong, they sought the favor of the Prophet by flatteries, Had they asked him without disguise, they knew that he was of himself disposed to seek the well being of the people; but as they were of a double mind, they set before him their miserable state, which might; have roused the Prophet still more to make intercession to God for them. And for this reason they added, <em>as thine eyes see us </em>And they set before him this sad spectacle, to create sympathy in the Prophet. And it then follows, And <em>may Jehovah thy God shew us the way in which we are to walk. </em>They now explained more clearly why they wished prayer to be made for them, even that God might answer and shew what he wished them to do. </p></div>
