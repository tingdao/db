<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>A light for the revelation of the Gentiles </em>Simeon now points out the purpose for which Christ was to be exhibited by the Father before all nations. It was that he might <em>enlighten the Gentiles, </em>who had been formerly in darkness, and might be <em>the glory of his people Israel </em>There is propriety in the distinction here made between the <em>people Israel </em>and the <em>Gentiles: </em>for by the right of adoption the children of Abraham “were nigh” (<span class="bvs">Eph_2:17</span>) to God, while the <em>Gentiles, </em>with whom God had made no “covenants of promise,” were “strangers” to the Church, (<span class="bvs">Eph_2:12</span>.) For this reason, <em>Israel </em>is called, in other passages, not only the son of God, but his<em>first-born, </em>(<span class="bvs">Jer_31:9</span>;) and Paul informs us, that “Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers” (<span class="bvs">Rom_15:8</span>.) The preference given to <em>Israel </em>above the Gentiles is, that all without distinction may obtain salvation in Christ. </p><p><em>A light for revelation </em><span class="cite-ref">(198)</span> means <em>for enlightening the Gentiles </em>Hence we infer, that men are by nature destitute of light, till Christ, “the Sun of Righteousness,” (<span class="bvs">Mal_4:2</span>,) shine upon them. With regard to <em>Israel, </em>though God had bestowed upon him distinguished honor, yet all his glory rests on this single article, that a Redeemer had been promised to him. </p><p><strong>(198)</strong> “Lumen ad revelationem.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">La ou nous avons traduit, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Pour l'esclaircissement, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">le mot Grec signifie quelque fois </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Revelation: </em><span class="lang fr-fr">mais Simeon vent dire ici, Pour esclairer ou illuminer les Gentils</span>.” — “Where we have translated, <em>For the enlightening, </em>the Greek word (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀποχάλυψις</span>) sometimes signifies <em>Revelation: </em>but Simeon means here, To enlighten or illuminate the Gentiles.” </p></div>
