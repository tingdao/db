<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Judge me, O Jehovah! </em>I have just said, that David betakes himself to the judgment of God, because he found neither equity nor humanity among men. The Hebrew word which is rendered to <em>judge, </em>signifies to undertake the cognisance of a cause. The meaning here, therefore, is as if David called upon God to be the defender of his right. <span class="cite-ref">(567)</span> When God leaves us for a time to the injuries and petulance of our enemies, he seems to neglect our cause; but when he restrains them from assailing us at their pleasure he clearly demonstrates that the defense of our cause is the object of his care. Let us, therefore, learn from the example of David, when we are destitute of man’s aid, to have recourse to the judgment-seat of God, and to rely upon his protection. The clause which follows is variously explained by interpreters. Some read it in connection with the first clause, <em>Judge me, O Jehovah! because I have walked in mine integrity; </em>but others refer it to the last clause, <em>Because I have walked in mine integrity, therefore I shall not stumble. </em>In my opinion, it may be properly connected with both. As it is the proper work of God to maintain and defend righteous causes, the Psalmist, in constituting him his defender, summons him as the witness of his integrity and trust, and thus conceives the hope of obtaining his aid. If, on the other hand, any one thinks that the clauses should be separated, it seems most probable that this sentence, <em>judge me, O Lord! </em>should be read by itself; and then that the second prayer should follow, <em>that God would not allow him to stumble, because he had behaved himself inoffensively and uprightly, etc. </em>But there is a force in the possessive pronoun <em>my, </em>which interpreters have overlooked. For David does not simply aver that he had been upright, but that he had constantly proceeded in an upright course, without being driven from his purpose, however powerful the devices by which he had been assailed. When wicked men attack us with a view to overwhelm us, either by force or fraud, we know how difficult it is to preserve always the same fortitude. We place our hope of victory in endeavoring resolutely and vigorously to oppose force to force, and art to art. And this is a temptation which so much the more affects honest and steady men, who are otherwise zealous to do well, when the cruelty of their enemies compels them to turn aside from the right path. Let us, therefore, learn from the example of David, even when an opportunity of injuring our enemies is offered us, and when by various methods they force and provoke us, to remain firm in our course, and not suffer ourselves to be diverted in any manner from persevering in the path of our integrity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(567)</span><em>Hammond </em>renders the original word, “Plead for, or defend me;” and <em>Green</em>, “Vindicate me.” The word denotes both the act of a judge and of an advocate. This last view agrees very well with the scope of the psalm, which, from the strong assertions of innocence with which it abounds, appears to have been written by David in vindication of himself from various crimes which had been alleged against him; although the particular events to which it refers are not indicated. </p></div></div>
