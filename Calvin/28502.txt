<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>But if an unbeliever depart. </em>This is the second department of his statement, in which he sets at liberty a believing husband, who is prepared to dwell with an unbelieving wife, but is rejected by her, and in like manner a woman who is, without any fault on her part, repudiated by her husband; for in that case the unbelieving party makes a divorce with God rather than with his or her partner. There is, therefore, in this case a special reason, inasmuch as the first and chief bond is not merely loosed, but even utterly broken through. While some are of opinion that we are at this day situated in a much similar way with Papists, <span class="cite-ref">(403)</span> we ought to consider wisely what difference there is between the two cases, that we may not attempt anything rashly. </p><p><em>In peace. </em>Here, too, interpreters differ; for some take it in this way — “We are called <em>in peace: </em>let us therefore avoid all ground and occasion of quarrels.” I take it in a more simple way: “Let us, so far as we can, cultivate peace with all, to which we have been called. We must not, therefore, rashly separate from unbelievers, unless they first make a divorce. God, therefore, has <em>called us in peace </em>to this end, that we might cultivate peace with all, by acting properly towards every one.” This, then, belongs to the former department of his statement — that </p><p>believers ought to remain with unbelievers, if they are p1eased, etc., (<span class="bvs">1Co_7:12</span>,) </p><p>because a desire for divorce is at variance with our profession. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(403)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que nous auons auiourd’huy semblable cause de nous departir d’avec les Papistes</span>;” — “That we have at this day similar ground of separation from Papists.” </p></div></div>
