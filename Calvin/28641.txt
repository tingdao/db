<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man </em>He now points out the purpose for which God has appointed his gifts, for he does not confer them upon us in vain, nor does he intend that they shall serve the purpose of ostentation. Hence we must inquire as to the purpose for which they are conferred. As to this Paul answers — (<em>with a view to utility) </em>— <span class="lang el-gr">πρὸς τὸ συμφερον</span>; that is, that the Church may receive advantage thereby. <em>The manifestation of the Spirit </em>may be taken in a passive as well as in an active sense — in a <em>passive </em>sense, because wherever there is prophecy, or knowledge, or any other gift, the Spirit of God does there <em>manifest </em>himself — in an <em>active </em>sense, because the Spirit of God, when he enriches us with any gift, unlocks his treasures, for the purpose of <em>manifesting to </em>us those things that would otherwise have been concealed and shut up. The second interpretation suits better. The view taken by Chrysostom is rather harsh and forced — that this term is used, <span class="cite-ref">(736)</span> because unbelievers do not recognize God, except by visible miracles. </p><p><strong>(736)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que ceci est appele </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Manifestation </em> :<em>” </em>— “That this is termed a <em>Manifestation</em>. ” </p></div>
