<div class="comment-content"><p>David expresses yet more distinctly what kind of fear and service God requires. Since it is the will of God to reign by the hand of his Son, and since he has engraved on his person the marks and insignia of his own glory, the proper proof of our obedience and piety towards him is reverently to embrace his Son, whom he has appointed king over us, according to the declaration, </p><p>“He that honoureth not the Son, <LineBreak />honoureth not the Father who hath sent him,” (<span class="bvs">Joh_5:23</span>) </p><p>The term kiss refers to the solemn token or sign of honor which subjects were wont to yield to their sovereigns. The sum is, that God is defrauded of his honor if he is slot served in Christ. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">בר</span> Bar, signifies both a son and an elect person; but in whatever way you take it, the meaning will remain the same. Christ was truly chosen of the Father, who has given him all power, that he alone should stand pre-eminent above both men and angels. On which account also he is said to be “sealed” by God, (<span class="bvs">Joh_6:27</span>) because a peculiar dignity was, conferred upon him, which removes him to a distance from all creatures. Some interpreters expound it, <em>kiss or embrace what is pure</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(30)</span> which is a strange and rather forced interpretation. For my part, I willingly retain the name of son, which answers well to a former sentence, where it was said, “Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.” </p><p>What follows immediately after is a warning to those who despise Christ, that their pride shall not go unpunished, as if he had said, As Christ is not despised without indignity being done to the Father, who hath adorned him with his own glory, so the Father himself will not allow such an invasion of his sacred rights to pass unpunished. And to teach them to beware of vainly deceiving themselves with the hope of a lengthened delay, and from their present ease indulging themselves in vain pleasures, they are plainly told that his wrath will be kindled <em>in a moment</em>. For we see, when God for a time connives at the wicked, and bears with them, how they abuse this forbearance, by growing more presumptuous, because they do not think of his judgments otherwise, than according to sight and feeling. Some interpreters, I know, explain the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">כמעט</span>, <em>Camoat</em>, which we have rendered, <em>in a moment</em>, in a different way, namely, that as soon as God’s wrath is kindled in even a small degree, it will be all over with the reprobate. But it is more suitable to apply it to time, and to view it as a warning to the proud not to harden themselves in their stupidity and indifference, nor flatter themselves from the patience of God, with the hope of escaping unpunished. Moreover, although this word appears to be put for the purpose of giving a reason of what goes before, <span class="cite-ref">(31)</span> namely, why those who refuse to kiss the Son shall perish, and although the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, <em>ki</em>, signifies more frequently <em>for </em>than <em>when</em>, yet I am unwilling to depart from the commonly received translation, and have thought it proper to render the original word by the adverb <em>when</em>, which denotes both the reason and time of what is predicated. Some explain the phrases, <em>to perish from the way</em>, as meaning, a perverse way, or wicked manner of listing. Others resolve it thus, lest your way perish, according to that saying of the first psalm, the way of the ungodly shall perish. But I am rather inclined to attach to the words a different meaning, and to view them as a denunciation against the ungodly, by which they are warned that the wrath of God will cut them off when they think themselves to be only in the middle of their race. We know how the despisers of God are accustomed to flatter themselves in prosperity, and run to great excess in riot. The prophet, therefore, with great propriety, threatens that when they shall say, Peace and safety, reckoning themselves at a great distance from their end, they shall be cut off by a sudden destruction, (<span class="bvs">1Th_5:3</span>) </p><p>The concluding sentence of the psalm qualifies what was formerly said concerning the severity of Christ; for his iron rod and the fiery wrath of God would strike terror into all men without distinction, unless this comfort had been added. Having, therefore discoursed concerning the terrible judgment which hangs over the unbelieving, he now encourages God’s faithful and devout servants to entertain good hope, by setting forth the sweetness of his grace. Paul likewise observes the same order, (<span class="bvs">2Co_10:6</span>) for having declared that vengeance was in readiness against the disobedient, he immediately adds addressing himself to believers “When your obedience is fulfilled.” Now, we understand the meaning of the Psalmist. As believers might have applied to themselves the severity of which he makes mention, he opens to them a sanctuary of hope, whither they may flee, in order not to be overwhelmed by the terror of God’s wrath; <span class="cite-ref">(32)</span> just as Joel (<span class="bvs">Joe_2:32</span>) also after having summoned the ungodly to the awful judgment-seat of God, which of itself is terrible to men, <span class="cite-ref">(33)</span> immediately subjoins the comfort, Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. For it appears to me that this exclamation, <em>Blessed are all they that put their trust in him, </em><span class="cite-ref">(34)</span> should be read as a distinct sentence by itself. The pronoun him may be referred as well to God as to Christ, but, in my judgment, it agrees better with the whole scope of the psalm to understand it of Christ, whom the Psalmist before enjoined kings and judges of the earth to kiss. </p><p><strong>(30)</strong> The word <span class="lang he-il">בר</span>, <em>Bar</em>, which here signifies son, is also sometimes used to denote pure, as it is in <span class="bvs">Job_11:4</span>, <span class="bvs">Psa_24:4</span> and <span class="bvs">Psa_73:1</span>. In this former sense it is a Chaldee word, in the latter it is a Hebrew one. This rendering, of which Calvin disapproves, is substantially that of the Septuagint, which reads, <span class="lang el-gr">δραξασθε παιδειας</span>, literally, lay hold upon instruction. But as the Arabic version of the Psalms, which generally follows the Septuagint, has used here (and in many other places, where the Septuangint has <span class="lang el-gr">παιδειας</span>) a word which signifies not only instruction, but good morals, virtue, Street thinks that the authors of the Septuangint, by <span class="lang el-gr">παιδειας</span>, meant good morals, or virtue in general, and that they understand <span class="lang he-il">בר</span>, <em>Bar</em>, as a general expression for the same thing. The Chaldee, Vulgate, and Ethiopic version, also render <span class="lang he-il">בר</span>, <em>Bar</em>, by a word meaning doctrine or discipline. “This is a remarkable case,” says Dr. Adam Clark, “and especially that in so pure a piece of Hebrew as this poem is, a Chaldee word should have been found, <span class="lang he-il">בר</span>, <em>Bar</em>, instead of <span class="lang he-il">בן</span>, <em>Ben</em>, which adds nothing to the strength of the expression, or the elegance of the poetry. I know that <span class="lang he-il">בר</span>, <em>Bar</em>, is also pure Hebrew as well as Chaldee; but it is taken in the former language in the sense of purifying, the versions probably understood it so here. Embrace that which is pure, namely, the doctrine of God. </p><p><strong>(31)</strong><span class="lang fr-fr">Pour rendre raison du precedent ascavoir pour quoy c’est qu’ila periront</span>. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(32)</strong><span class="lang fr-fr">Pour n’estre point accablez de la frayeur d’ire de Dieu</span>. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(33)</strong><span class="lang fr-fr">Qui de soy est espouvantable aux hommes</span> — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(34)</strong> The word <span class="lang he-il">אשרי</span>, <em>ashre</em>, which occurs in the beginning of the psalm, is also used here; and therefore, the word may be rendered, O the blessednesses of all those who put their trust in him. </p></div>
