<div class="comment-content"><p>The verse which I read at the end of my last Lecture must be now repeated to you, <em>Behold, the tempest </em>(or <em>whirlwind</em>) <em>of Jehovah! it shall go forth with fury; even the impending whirlwind! on the head of the ungodly shall it abide, </em>or fall; for <span class="lang he-il">יחול</span>, <em>ichul, </em>means both. The Prophet now assails with more vehemence the false teachers, for they were almost stupid. None, indeed, can betray so much audacity as to oppose God, except when wholly blinded by Satan. Hence our Prophet deals with the false teachers as with fanatics or those wholly stupified: he tells them that God would come like a <em>whirlwind </em>Whether we render it a whirlwind or a storm, there is not much difference. <span class="cite-ref">(99)</span> And he adds, that they could not escape, for the wrath of God was impending over them, and would at length remain on them. </p><p>Now, it is usual in Scripture to deal very sharply with hypocrites, and especially with false teachers, because Satan rules in them to an awful extent. And doubtless, as I have already said, except a person be fascinated with illusions, he could not dare to oppose God. There is, then, no wonder that the Prophet fulminates against these ungodly teachers; for it was nothing but play and sport to them to pretend God’s sacred name that they might deceive the people. He afterwards adds, — </p><p><strong>(99)</strong> “Storm,” or tempest, is the most suitable here. The word <span class="lang he-il">חמה</span>, after Jehovah, seems to belong to it — “hot tempest;” the reference is to the burning winds of the south. See <span class="bvs">Jer_4:11</span>. The verse may be thus rendered, — </p><p>Behold the burning tempest of Jehovah! It shall go forth, yea, a pregnant tempest; On the head of the wicked shall it burst. </p><p>The tempest or storm would be “burning,” and also “pregnant,” or in travail, as the word means; and being as it were in labor, it would “burst,” or literally bring forth on the head of the wicked. The verb is not from <span class="lang he-il">יחל</span>, but from <span class="lang he-il">חול</span>, which means not only to be in labor but also to bring forth. “It shall come,” is the Sept. and the Vulg.; our version is the Targum. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
