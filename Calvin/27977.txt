<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Who show the work of the law </em><span class="cite-ref">(73)</span><em>written, etc.</em>; that is, they prove that there is imprinted on their hearts a discrimination and judgment by which they distinguish between what is just and unjust, between what is honest and dishonest. He means not that it was so engraven on their will, that they sought and diligently pursued it, but that they were so mastered by the power of truth, that they could not disapprove of it. For why did they institute religious rites, except that they were convinced that God ought to be worshipped? Why were they ashamed of adultery and theft, except that they deemed them evils? </p><p>Without reason then is the power of the will deduced from this passage, as though Paul had said, that the keeping of the law is within our power; for he speaks not of the power to fulfill the law, but of the knowledge of it. Nor is the word <em>heart </em>to be taken for the seat of the affections, but only for the understanding, as it is found in <span class="bvs">Deu_29:4</span>, </p><p>“The Lord hath not given thee a heart to understand;” </p><p>and in <span class="bvs">Luk_24:25</span>, </p><p>“O foolish men, and slow in heart to believe.” </p><p>Nor can we conclude from this passage, that there is in men a<em>full </em>knowledge of the law, but that there are only some seeds of what is right implanted in their nature, evidenced by such acts as these — All the Gentiles alike instituted religious rites, they made laws to punish adultery, and theft, and murder, they commended good faith in bargains and contracts. They have thus indeed proved, that God ought to be worshipped, that adultery, and theft, and murder are evils, that honesty is commendable. It is not to our purpose to inquire what sort of God they imagined him to be, or how many gods they devised; it is enough to know, that they thought that there is a God, and that honor and worship are due to him. It matters not whether they permitted the coveting of another man’s wife, or of his possessions, or of any thing which was his, — whether they connived at wrath and hatred; inasmuch as it was not right for them to covet what they knew to be evil when done. </p><p><em>Their conscience at the same time attesting, etc. </em>He could not have more forcibly urged them than by the testimony of their own conscience, which is equal to a thousand witnesses. By the consciousness of having done good, men sustain and comfort themselves; those who are conscious of having done evil, are inwardly harassed and tormented. Hence came these sayings of the heathens — “A good conscience is the widest sphere; but a bad one is the cruelest executioner, and more fiercely torments the ungodly than any furies can do.” There is then a certain knowledge of the law by nature, which says, “This is good and worthy of being desired; that ought to be abhorred.” </p><p>But observe how intelligently he defines conscience: he says, that reasons come to our minds, by which we defend what is rightly done, and that there are those which accuse and reprove us for our vices; <span class="cite-ref">(74)</span> and he refers this process of accusation and defense to the day of the Lord; not that it will then first commence, for it is now continually carried on, but that it will then also be in operation; and he says this, that no one should disregard this process, as though it were vain and evanescent. And he has put, <em>in the day, </em>instead of, <em>at the day, </em>— a similar instance to what we have already observed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(73)</span> By the work of the law<span class="lang el-gr">, τὸ ἔργον τοῦ νόμου, </span> is to be understood what the law requires. The “work of God,” in <span class="bvs">Joh_6:29</span>, is of the same import, that is, the work which God requires or demands; and the same word is plural in the former verse<span class="lang el-gr">, τὰ ἔργα </span> — “the works of God.” So here, in the former verse, it is<span class="lang el-gr">τὰ τοῦ νόμου </span> — “the things of the law,” where we may suppose<span class="lang el-gr">ἔργα</span> to be understood. The common expression, “the works of the law,” has the same meaning, that is, such works as the law prescribes and requires. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(74)</span> [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] seems to consider that the latter part of the verse is only a expansion or an exposition of the preceding clause respecting “conscience:” but it seems to contain a distinct idea. The testimony of conscience is one thing, which is instantaneous, without reflection: and the thoughts or the reasonings<span class="lang el-gr">— λογισμῶν, </span> which alternately or mutually accuse or excuse, seem to refer to a process carried on by the mind, by which the innate voice of conscience is confirmed. This is the view taken by [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Barnes </span>], and to which [<span class="bvs">Hodge </span>] is inclined. </p><p>Another view of the latter clause is given by [<span class="bvs">Doddridge </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Macknight </span>] <em>, </em>[<span class="bvs">Haldane </span>] <em>, </em>and [<span class="bvs">Chalmers </span>] The last gives this paraphrase of the whole verse, — “For they show that the matter of the law is written in their hearts — both from their conscience testifying what is right and wrong in their own conduct, and from their reasonings in which they either accuse or vindicate one another.” </p><p>But to regard the two clauses as referring to conscience and the inward workings of the mind, appears more consistent with the context. The Gentiles are those spoken of: God gave them no outward law, but the law of nature which is inward. Hence in the following verse he speaks of God as judging “the secrets of men,” as the inward law will be the rule of judgment to the Gentiles — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
