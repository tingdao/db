<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>And there shall ye eat. </em>We see that the sanctuary in which God manifested Himself is called His face; <span class="cite-ref">(105)</span> for, although believers are taught that always, wherever they dwell, they walk before God; yet they placed themselves nearer, and in some special manner in His sight, when they approached His sanctuary. By this mode of speaking God also stimulates the laziness or tardiness of the people, lest it should be irksome to them to come to the Ark of the Covenant for the purpose of sacrificing, inasmuch as this inestimable benefit would compensate for the labor and expense of the journey. I have elsewhere shewn that, when men are said to feast before the Lord, sacred feasts are thus distinguished from our daily meals. For this was as it were an accessory to the sacrifices, to eat what remained of the victims; and in this way the guests were made partakers of the offering, which custom even heathen nations imitated, though improperly. Again, God kindly invites them when He says, “ye shall rejoice in all that thou puttest thine hands unto,” for which some translate it, “in everything to which you shall have sent your hand;” literally it is, “in the sending forth of the land.” There is no ambiguity in the sense, for it refers to those works which require the motion and application of the hands. A little below, where I have translated it, “which he hath blessed,” (<em>quibus benedixerit,</em>) some insert the proposition <em>in, </em>and supply the pronoun <em>you, </em>(<em>i.e., in </em>which he hath blessed <em>you;</em>) but it is quite appropriate to say, that God blesses their works, although it may be understood of their families also. As to the command that the tithes should be eaten in the holy place, I do not extend it to tithes in general, <span class="cite-ref">(106)</span> for it was hardly probable that the food of those who were dispersed through various cities should be transferred to another place, so that they would perish (at home) <span class="cite-ref">(107)</span> from hunger; but I understand it of the second tithes, which the Levites separated to be a special and peculiar oblation; for we shall see elsewhere that what remained over passed into the nature of ordinary produce, as if the Levites ate of the fruits of their own possessions. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(105)</span><span class="lang he-il">לפני</span><em>, Heb.</em>; in conspectu, <em>Lat; </em>before, <em>A.V </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(106)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne s’estend pas en general a la nourriture des Levites</span>;” does not extend generally to the maintenance of the Levites. — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(107)</span> Added from <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
