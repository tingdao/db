<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And I will pray to the Father. </em>This was given as a remedy for soothing the grief which they might feel on account of Christ’s absence; but at the same time, Christ promises that he will give them strength <em>to keep his commandments</em>; For otherwise the exhortation would have had little effect. He therefore loses no time in informing them that, though he be absent from them in body, yet he will never allow them to remain destitute of assistance; for he will be present with them by his Spirit. </p><p>Here he calls the Spirit the gift of <em>the Father</em>, but a gift which he will obtain by his prayers; in another passage he promises that he will give the Spirit. <em>If I depart</em>, says he, <em>I will send</em>, <em>Him to you</em>, (<span class="bvs">Joh_16:7</span>.) Both statements are true and correct; for in so far as Christ is our Mediator and Intercessor, he obtains from <em>the Father </em>the grace of the Spirit, but in so far as he is God, he bestows that grace from himself. The meaning of this passage therefore is: “I was given to you by <em>the Father </em>to be <em>a Comforter</em>, but only for a time; now, having discharged my office, I will pray to him to give another <em>Comforter</em>, who will not be for a short time, but will remain always with you.” </p><p><em>And he will, give you another Comforter. </em>The word <em>Comforter </em>is here applied both to Christ and to the Spirit, and justly; for it is an office which belongs equally to both of them, to <em>comfort </em>and exhort us, and to guard us by their protection. Christ was the Protector of his disciples, so long as he dwelt in the world: and afterwards he committed them to the protection and guardianship of the Spirit. It may be asked, are we not still under the protection of Christ? The answer is easy. Christ is a continual Protector, but not in a visible way. So long as he dwelt in the world, he openly manifested himself as their Protector; but now he guards us by his Spirit. </p><p>He calls the Spirit another <em>Comforter</em>, on account of the difference between the blessings which we obtain from both. The peculiar office of Christ was, to appease the wrath of God by atoning for the sins of the world, to redeem men from death, to procure righteousness and life; and the peculiar office of the Spirit is, to make us partakers not only of Christ himself, but of all his blessings. And yet there would be no impropriety in inferring from this passage a distinction of Persons; for there must be some peculiarity in which the Spirit differs from the Son so as to be <em>another </em>than the Son. </p></div>
