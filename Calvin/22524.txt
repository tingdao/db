<div class="comment-content"><p>It follows, <em>Thou shouldest not enter the gates of my people in the day of their destruction, nor shouldest thou look on in their calamity</em>. Probably the Idumeans had made an irruption in company with the Assyrians and Chaldeans, when they ought to have remained at home, and there to lament the slaughter of their brethren. For if I cannot save my friend from death or from a calamity, I shall yet withdraw myself, for I could not bear to look on: but were I constrained to look on my friend, and be not able to succor him in his necessity, I should rather close my eyes; for there is in the eyes, we know, the tenderest sympathy. As then the Idumeans willingly went forth and entered Jerusalem with the enemies, it was hence evident that they were no better than wild beasts. <em>Thou shouldest not </em>then, he says, <em>enter the gates of my people in the day of slaughter, nor shouldest thou especially then, look on. </em>He again repeats <span class="lang he-il">גם אתה</span><em>gam ate</em>, thou also, or, especially thou: “If other neighbors do this, yet thou shouldest abstain, for thou art of the same blood; if thou can’t not bring help, show at least some token of grief and of sympathy: but as thou willingly and gladly lookest on their calamities, it is quite evident that there is not in thee a particle of right feeling.” </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>Thou shouldest not stretch forth thy hand to his substance</em>. Here he accuses the Idumeans of having been implicated in taking the spoils with other enemies, as though he said, “Ye have not only suffered your brethren to be pillaged, but ye became robbers yourselves. Ye ought to have felt sorrow in seeing them distressed by foreign enemies; but ye have plundered with them, and enriched yourselves with spoils; this certainly is by no means to be endured.” </p></div>
