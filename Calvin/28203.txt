<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>How shall they preach except they be sent? etc. </em>He intimates that it is a proof and a pledge of divine love when any nation is favored with the preaching of the gospel; and that no one is a preacher of it, but he whom God has raised up in his special providence, and that hence there is no doubt but that he visits that nation to whom the gospel is proclaimed. But as Paul does not treat here of the lawful call of any one, it would be superfluous to speak at large on the subject. It is enough for us to bear this only in mind, that the gospel does not fall like rain from the clouds, but is brought by the hands of men wherever it is sent from above. </p><p><em>As it is written, How beautiful, etc. </em>We are to apply this testimony to our present subject in this manner, The Lord, when he gave hope of deliverance to his people, commended the advent of those who brought the glad tidings of peace, by a remarkable eulogy; by this very circumstance he has made it evident that the apostolic ministry was to be held in no less esteem, by which the message of eternal life is brought to us. And it hence follows, that it is from God, since there is nothing in the world that is an object of desire and worthy of praise, which does not proceed from his hand. <span class="cite-ref">(331)</span></p><p>But hence we also learn how much ought all good men to desire, and how much they ought to value the preaching of the gospel, which is thus commended to us by the mouth of the Lord himself. Nor is there indeed a doubt, but that God has thus highly spoken of the incomparable value of this treasure, for the purpose of awakening the minds of all, so that they may anxiously desire it.

This is a striking instance that the Apostle quotes not from the <em>Septuagint</em>, when that version materially departs from the Hebrew, as is the case here. Though it appears to be a version of his own, he yet gives not the original literally, but accommodates it to his own purpose: he leaves out “on the mountains,” and adopts the plural number instead of the singular, both as to the participle “announcing” or evangelizing, and as to the word “good.” The words peace, good, and salvation, in Hebrew, seem to refer to the same thing, according to the usual style of the Prophets. </p><p>The words of Paul, as rendered by [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>], coincide more with the Hebrew, than as they are rendered in our common version. The verb<span class="lang el-gr">εὐαγγελίζω, </span> is often used simply in the sense of announcing, publishing, declaring or preaching, as in <span class="bvs">Luk_3:18</span>; <span class="bvs">Act_5:42</span>, etc.; and in this sense it exactly corresponds with <span class="lang he-il">בשר</span>, which means the same, though the other idea of the Greek verb, that of evangelizing, has been wrongly given to it; for it is applied to the <em>announcing </em>of bad as well as of good news. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
