<div class="comment-content"><p>The singular loftiness of the mind of Paul, though it may be seen to greater advantage in his other writings which treat of weightier matters, is also attested by this Epistle, in which, while he handles a subject otherwise low and mean, he rises to God with his wonted elevation. Sending back a runaway slave and thief, he supplicates pardon for him. But in pleading this cause, he discourses about Christian forbearance <span class="cite-ref">(269)</span> with such ability, that he appears to speak about the interests of the whole Church rather than the private affairs of a single individual. In behalf of a man of the lowest condition, he demeans himself so modestly and humbly, that nowhere else is the meekness of his temper painted in a more lively manner. </p><p><strong>1.</strong><em>A prisoner of Jesus Christ</em>. In the same sense in which he elsewhere calls himself an Apostle of Christ, or a minister of Christ, he now calls himself “a prisoner of Christ;” because the chains by which he was bound on account of the gospel, were the ornaments or badges of that embassy which he exercised for Christ. Accordingly, he mentions them for the sake of strengthening his authority; not that he was afraid of being despised, (for Philemon undoubtedly had so great reverence and esteem for him, that there was no need of assuming any title,) but because he was about to plead the cause of a runaway slave, the principal part of which was entreaty for forgiveness. </p><p><em>To Philemon our friend and fellow-laborer</em>. It is probable that this “Philemon” belonged to the order of pastors; for the title with which he adorns him, when he calls him <em>fellow-laborer</em>, is a title which he is not accustomed to bestow on a private individual. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(269)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De la douceur, moderation, et humanite</span>.” — “Of gentleness, moderation, and kindness.” </p></div></div>
