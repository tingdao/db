<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Simon Peter. </em>Prayer takes the first place at the beginning of this Epistle, and then follows thanksgiving, by which he excites the Jews to gratitude, lest they should forget what great benefits they had already received from God's hand. Why he called himself the <em>servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ</em>, we have elsewhere stated, even because no one is to be heard in the Church, except he speaks as from the mouth of Christ. But the word <em>servant </em>has a more general meaning, because it includes all the ministers of Christ, who sustain any public office in the Church. There was in the apostleship a higher rank of honor. He then intimates, that he was not one from the rank of ministers, but was made by the Lord an apostle, and therefore superior to them. <span class="cite-ref">(144)</span></p><p><em>Like precious faith. </em>This is a commendation of the grace which God had indiscriminately shewed to all his elect people; for it was no common gift, that they had all been called to one and the same faith, since faith is the special and chief good of man. But he calls it <em>like </em>or equally<em>precious, </em>not that it is equal in all, but because all possess by faith the same Christ with his righteousness, and the same salvation. Though then the measure is different, that does not prevent the knowledge of God from being common to all, and the fruit which proceeds from it. Thus we have a real fellowship of faith with Peter and the Apostles. </p><p>He adds, <em>through the righteousness of God, </em>in order that they might know that they did not obtain faith through their own efforts or strength, but through God's favor alone. For these things stand opposed the one to the other, the righteousness of God (in the sense in which it is taken here) and the merit of man. For the efficient cause of faith is called God's righteousness for this reason, because no one is capable of conferring it on himself. So the righteousness that is to be understood, is not that which remains in God, but that which he imparts to men, as in <span class="bvs">Rom_3:22</span>. Besides, he ascribes this righteousness in common to God and to Christ, because it flows from God, and through Christ it flows down to us. <span class="cite-ref">(145)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(144)</span> Simeon, and not Simon, is the name as here given, though a few copies and the <em>Vulg. </em>have Simon. His name is given both ways elsewhere; see <span class="bvs">Luk_5:8</span>, and <span class="bvs">Act_15:14</span>. Why he called himself Peter in the first Epistle, and Simeon Peter here, does not appear. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(145)</span> It has been maintained by many, that the rendering of these words ought to be, “of our God and Savior Jesus Christ,” In this case the <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν</span> before “righteousness” would be rendered “in;” for it is more suitable to say that faith is<em>in </em>than<em>through </em>the righteousness of Christ. Christ is thus called here God as well as Savior; and so he is called “our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” in <span class="bvs">2Pe_3:18</span>, the article being used in the same manner. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
