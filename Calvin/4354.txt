<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>From thence they removed, and pitched. </em>I will presently add, what Moses relates in Deuteronomy respecting the Moabites and Ammonites. Since here he only briefly touches upon the main facts, he only specifies that the people came to the borders of their enemies, where it was necessary to give battle, because there was no means of entering the land of Canaan, except by force of arms. Here, then, was the end of their journeying, for, when the Amorites were conquered, they began to inhabit their cities. He, therefore, immediately adds, that this place would be memorable in all ages, because in it God again exerted His power, by putting to flight their enemies. Still translators appear to me to be mistaken as to the meaning of the words. Almost all of them render the word <span class="lang he-il">ספר</span>, <em>sepher, </em>“the book;” and afterwards eagerly discuss what book it is, without coming to any satisfactory conclusion. I rather understand it to mean <em>“narration;” </em>as if Moses had said, that when the wars of Jehovah shall be recounted, the memory of this place would be celebrated; as David, when he is recounting, and magnifying God’s mercies, expressly mentions that king Sihon and Og were conquered. </p><p>There is also another ambiguity in the following words: for some suppose <em>Vaheb </em>to be the proper name of a city, and <em>Suphah </em>a noun common, which they translate “in a whirlwind;” <span class="cite-ref">(123)</span> but, since the shore of the Red Sea was not habitable, I do not see how mention could be suitably made of any city situated there. But if they think it was a city near Arnon, it is surprising that it should never be spoken of elsewhere, and yet here referred to, as if it were well known. I therefore rather incline to their opinion, who explain it as a vero, and suppose that <span class="lang he-il">ו</span><em>(vau) </em>is used for <span class="lang he-il">י</span><em>(yod,) </em>so that the sense should be; As God had begun to fight gloriously for the Israelites at the Red Sea, so also He continued the same grace at Arnon. I admit, that if the points be scrupulously insisted upon, this meaning would not be altogether accordant with grammar; but I prefer eliciting a probable meaning at the cost of a single point, than to go out of the way in search of poor conjectures, as they do who imagine <em>Vaheb </em>to be the proper name of a place. Appropriately, indeed, does Moses compare Arnon with the Red Sea, in order to shew that God’s grace, at its end, is thoroughly in accordance with its commencement. He had mightily fought against the Egyptians, and had destroyed the army of Pharaoh in the Red Sea, but small would have been the fruit of this deliverance, unless, with equal efficacy, He had succoured His people when they had to contend with the Canaanitish nations: for the question here is not as to God’s blessings in general, but only as to the victories, wherein it was manifested that the Israelites did not fight without the approval and guidance of God. Moses, therefore, does not recount the miracles performed in the desert: but only says, that in the history of the wars of God the name of Arnon would be equally renowned with that of the Red Sea. Still, in the word Arnon it must be observed that there is a <em>synecdoche; </em>forMoses comprehends in it all the subsequent battles. Since, therefore, from the time that the people arrived at Arnon, where their enemies came forth to meet them, God again lifted up His standard, and gloriously honored His people by continued victories — hence the special celebrity of the place arose. There is a poetical repetition in the verse, where, for the torrents, the stream of the torrents <span class="cite-ref">(124)</span> is spoken of, which <em>descends </em>to Ar, and reposes in the border of Moab. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(123)</span><span class="lang he-il">את-והב בסופה</span><em>eth-vaheb b’suphah. </em>None of the most ancient translations can be said to be in unison with the present reading of the Hebrew in this clause. The <em>LXX. </em>appear to have read <span class="lang he-il">זהב</span> and render it <span class="lang el-gr">τὴν Ζωὸβ ἐφλόγισε</span> The Chaldee Paraphrast, Onkelos, has <span class="lang he-il">על ימא דסוף</span>, “By the sea of Suph,” <em>i.e., </em>the Red Sea. The Syriac has, “A flame with a whirlwind,” translating <span class="lang he-il">סופה</span> instead of treating it as a proper name, and having apparently read some form of <span class="lang he-il">להב</span> instead of <span class="lang he-il">את-והב</span>. The <em>V</em>. has, “Sicut fecit in mari rubro;” our <em>A.V. </em>“What he did in the Red Sea,” but in the Margin, “Vaheb in Suphah.” The translation of <em>S. M. </em>agrees with that in the text of <em>A. F.; </em>but in his notes he says, “Kimchi interprets <span class="lang he-il">והב</span> to be the name of a place, but R. Salomon treats it as equivalent to <span class="lang he-il">יהב</span><em>he gave, </em>and expounds the clause thus, As God gave many signs by the Red Sea, so was He wonderful in his works by the brook Arnon. — <em>W </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(124)</span><em>A.V. </em>“the brooks” — “the stream of the brooks.” </p></div></div>
