<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>I know that you are Abraham’s seed. </em>I explain this as said by way of concession. Yet at the same time he ridicules their folly in glorying in so absurd a title, as if he had said: “Granting that on which you flatter yourselves so much, still what avails it that those men are called <em>the children of Abraham</em>, who are enraged against God and his ministers, and who are actuated by such wicked and detestable hatred of the truth, that they rush headlong to shed innocent blood?” Hence it follows that nothing is farther from their true character than what they wished to be called, because they have no resemblance to <em>Abraham </em></p><p><em>You seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you. </em>He means that they are not merely murderers, but are driven to such rage by hatred of God and his truth, which is far more heinous; for such an enormity does not merely extend to men, but likewise dishonors God. He says, <em>that they cannot receive his words</em>, because through malice they keep their minds shut, so that they cannot admit anything wholesome. </p></div>
