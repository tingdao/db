<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>My soul has cleaved hard after thee </em>The Hebrew verb means also <em>to apprehend, </em>or <em>follow, </em>especially when in construction with the preposition which is here joined to it, and therefore we might very properly render the words, — <em>My soul shall press or follow after thee. </em><span class="cite-ref">(434)</span> But even should the other translation be retained, the sense is, that David’s heart was devoted to God with steadfast perseverance. The phrase, <em>after thee, </em>is emphatical, and denotes that he would follow with unwearied constancy, long as the way might be, and full of hardships, and beset with obstacles, and however sovereignly God might himself seem to withdraw his presence. The latter clause of the verse may be taken as referring simply to the deliverance which he had previously mentioned as having been received. He had good reason to persevere, without fainting, in following after God, when he considered that he had been preserved in safety, up to this time, by the divine hand. But I would understand the words as having a more extensive application, and consider that David here speaks of the grace of perseverance, which would be bestowed upon him by the Spirit. To say that he would cleave to God, with an unwavering purpose, at all hazards, might have sounded like the language of vain boasting, had he not qualified the assertion by adding, that he would do this in so far as he was sustained by the hand of God. </p><p><strong>(434)</strong> Dr Adam Clarke renders, “My soul cleaves, or is glued after thee.” “This phrase,” says he, “not only shows the <em>diligence </em>of the pursuit, and the <em>nearness </em>of the attainment, but also the <em>fast hold </em>he had got of the mercy of his God.” </p></div>
