<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>57.</strong><em>We will call the damsel</em>. Bethuel, who had before unreservedly given his daughter in marriage, now seems to adhere, with but little constancy, to his purpose. When, however, he had previously offered his daughter, without making any exception, he is to be understood as having done it, only so far as he was able. But now, Moses declares that he did not exercise tyranny over his daughter, so as to thrust her out reluctantly, or to compel her to marry against her will, but left her to her own free choice. Truly, in this matter, the authority of parents ought to be sacred: but a middle course is to be pursued, so that the parties concerned may make their contract spontaneously, and with mutual consent. It is not right to understand that Rebekah in answering so explicitly, showed contempt for the paternal roof, or too anxiously desired a husband; <span class="cite-ref">(11)</span> but since she saw that the affair was transacted by the authority of her father, and with the consent of her mother, she also herself acquiesced in it. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(11)</span> “Vel procax juvencula maritum nimis cupide appeteret.” </p></div></div>
