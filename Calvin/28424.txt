<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>If any man’s work remains, he will receive a reward. </em>His meaning is, that those are fools who depend on man’s estimation, so as to reckon it enough to be approved by men, for <em>then only </em>will the work have praise and recompense — when it has stood the test of the <em>day of the Lord </em>Hence he exhorts His true ministers to have an eye to <em>that day. </em>For by the word <em>remains</em>, he intimates that doctrines fly about as it were in an unsettled state, nay more, like empty bubbles, they glitter for the moment, until they have come to be thoroughly tested. Hence it follows, that we must reckon as nothing all the applauses of the world, the emptiness of which will in a very little be exposed by heaven’s judgment. </p></div>
