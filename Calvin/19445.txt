<div class="comment-content"><p>He says, <em>Behold I, </em>etc.; it was said before, Nebuchadnezzar is come to make war with us: now he says, “I am God;” as though he had said, “Nebuchadnezzar may be conquered, he may change his counsel, he may leave you through weariness; but know ye that Nebuchadnezzar fights under my authority.” <em>Behold, </em>he says, I prohibit (for so ought <span class="lang he-il">מסכ</span> to be rendered) <em>all the warlike instruments which are in your hands, and with which ye fight against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans; </em>as though he had said, “However furnished ye may be with weapons and forces, and whatever may be necessary to defend the city, I forbid the use of these weapons, that is, I will cause that they will avail you nothing.” Some, as I have said, render the word, “I will turn them against you.” But the meaning seems more suitable to the etymology of the word, when we say, that the weapons which the Jews had would avail them nothing, because God would prevent them from producing any effect. <span class="cite-ref">(21)</span></p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>the Chaldeans, who fight without the wall against you </em>He described their state at that time, for the city was besieged by the Chaldeans; there was a wall between them, and the Jews thought that they could repel the attacks of their enemies. But God says, “theChaldeans are this day shut out by the wall, <em>but I will gather them, </em>he says, <em>into the middle of this city; </em>that is, I will make a breach, so that the wall may not be a hinderance to prevent, the Chaldeans from occupying the very bosom of the city.” It follows, — </p><p><strong>(21)</strong> The verb <span class="lang he-il">סכ</span> means to turn, to turn aside, to turn round, to change; it seems to mean here to turn to a contrary purpose, to turn from the right use, to divert, to revert, or to reverse, “Behold, I will reverse the instruments of war which are in your hands; <span class="lang el-gr">μετάστρεφω</span> — I change,” that is, to what is opposite, is the Sept.; Blayney reads, “Behold, I will turn aside,” etc. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
