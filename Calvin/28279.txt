<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Not in reveling, etc. </em>He mentions here three kinds of vices, and to each he has given two names, — intemperant and excess in living, — carnal lust and uncleanness, which is connected with it, — and envy and contention. If these have in them so much filthiness, that even carnal men are ashamed to commit them before the eyes of men, it behooves us, who are in the light of God, at all times to abstain from them; yea, even when we are withdrawn from the presence of men. As to the third vice, though contention is put before envying, there is yet. no doubt but that Paul intended to remind us, that strifes and contests arise from this fountain; for when any one seeks to excel, there is envying of one another; but ambition is the source of both evils. <span class="cite-ref">(411)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(411)</span> The case is the same with the two preceding instances; the vice which seems to follow is placed first. Revelling is first mentioned, though drunkenness goes before it; and “chambering,” or concubinage, or indulgence in unlawful lusts is first stated, though lasciviousness or wantonness is the source from which it proceeds. It is an example of the Apostle’s mode of writing similar to what we find in <span class="bvs">Rom_11:29</span>, as to “the gifts and calling of God,” and in <span class="bvs">Rom_11:33</span>, as to “the wisdom and knowledge of God.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
