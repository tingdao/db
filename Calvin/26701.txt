<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit </em>As some men corrupt the grace of God, others suppress it maliciously, and others choke it by carelessness, Christ intends by these words to awaken anxious inquiry, by declaring that all <em>the branches </em>which shall be unfruitful will be cut off from <em>the vine </em>But here comes a question. Can any one who is engrafted into Christ be without fruit? I answer, many are supposed to be <em>in the vine</em>, according to the opinion of men, who actually have no root <em>in the vine </em>Thus, in the writings of the prophets, the Lord calls the people of Israel <em>his vine</em>, because, by outward profession, they had the name of The Church. </p><p><em>And every branch that beareth, fruit he pruneth. </em>By these words, he shows that believers need incessant culture that they may be prevented from degenerating; and that they produce nothing good, unless God continually apply his hand; for it will not be enough to have been once made partakers of adoption, if God do not continue the work of his grace in us. He speaks of pruning or <em>cleansing</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(77)</span> because our flesh abounds in superfluities and destructive vices, and is too fertile in producing them, and because they grow and multiply without end, if we are not <em>cleansed </em>or <em>pruned </em><span class="cite-ref">(78)</span> by the hand of God. When he says that vines are <em>pruned</em>, <em>that they may yield more abundant fruit</em>, he shows what ought to be the progress of believers in the course of true religion? <span class="cite-ref">(79)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(77)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il parle de tailler ou purger</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(78)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Repurgez et taillez</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(79)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Des fideles au cours de la vraye religion</span>.” </p></div></div>
