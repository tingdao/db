<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>In Jehovah do I put my trust. </em>Almost all interpreters think that this is a complaint which David brings against his countrymen, that while seeking in every quarter for hiding-places, he could find nowhere even common humanity. And it is indeed true, that in the whole course of his wanderings, after betaking himself to flight to escape the cruelty of Saul, he could find no secure place of retreat, at least, none where he might continue for any length of time undisturbed. He might, therefore, justly complain of his own countrymen, in that none of them deigned to shelter him when he was a fugitive. But I think he has a respect to something higher. When all men were striving, as it were, with each other, to drive him to despair, he must, according to the weakness of the flesh, have been afflicted with great and almost overwhelming distress of mind; but fortified by faith, he confidently and steadfastly leaned on the promises of God, and was thus preserved from yielding to the temptations to which he was exposed. These spiritual conflicts, with which God exercised him in the midst of his extreme perils, he here recounts. Accordingly, as I have just now observed, the psalm should be divided into two parts. Before celebrating the righteousness of God, which he displays in the preservation of the godly, the Psalmist shows how he had encountered even death itself, and yet, through faith and an upright conscience, had obtained the victory. As all men advised him to leave his country, and retire into some place of exile, where he might be concealed, inasmuch as there remained for him no hope of life, unless he should relinquish the kingdom, which had been promised to him; in the beginning of the psalm, he opposes to this perverse advice the shield of his trust in God. </p><p>But before entering farther upon the subject, let us interpret the words. The word <span class="lang he-il">נוד</span>, <em>nud, </em>which we have rendered <em>to flee, </em>is written in the plural number, and yet it is read in the singular; <span class="cite-ref">(238)</span> but, in my opinion, this is a corrupt reading. As David tells us that this was said to himself only, the Jewish doctors, thinking the plural number unsuitable, have taken it upon them to read the word in the singular. Some of them, wishing to retain the literal sense as it is called, perplex themselves with the question, why it is said, <em>Flee ye, </em>rather than <em>Flee thou; </em>and, at length, they have recourse to a very meagre subtilty, as if those who counselled him to betake himself to flight addressed both his soul and his body. But it was unnecessary labor to put themselves to so much trouble in a matter where there is no difficulty; for it is certain that those who counselled David did not say that he alone should flee, but that he should flee, together with all his attendants, who were in the same danger with himself. Although, therefore, they addressed themselves especially to David, yet they included his companions, who had a common cause with him, and were exposed to the like danger. Expositors, also, differ in their interpretation of what follows. Many render it <em>from your mountain, </em>as if it were <span class="lang he-il">מהרכם</span>, <em>meharkem; </em>and, according to them, there is a change of person, because those who spoke to him must have said, <em>flee thou from </em>Our<em>mountain. </em>But this is harsh and strained. Nor does it appear to me that they have any more reason on their side, when they say that Judea is here called mountain. Others think we should read <span class="lang he-il">הר כמו צפור</span>, <em>har kemo tsippor, </em><span class="cite-ref">(239)</span> that is, <em>into the mountain as a bird, </em>without a pronoun. <span class="cite-ref">(240)</span> But if we follow what I have said, it will agree very well with the scope of the passage to read thus, <em>Flee ye into your mountain, </em>for you are not permitted to dwell in your own country. I do not, however, think that any particular mountain is pointed out, but that David was sent away to the desert rocks wherever chance might lead him. Condemning those who gave him this advice, he declares that he depends upon the promise of God, and is not at all disposed thus to go away into exile. Such, then, was the condition of David, that, in his extreme necessity, all men repelled and chased him far away into desert places. </p><p>But as he seems to intimate that it would be a sign of distrust were he to place his safety in flight, it may be asked, whether or not it would have been lawful for him to flee; yea, we know that he was often forced to retire into exile, and driven about from place to place, and that he even sometimes hid himself in caves. I answer, it is true he was unsettled like a poor fearful bird, which leaps from branch to branch, <span class="cite-ref">(241)</span> and was compelled to seek for different bypaths, and to wander from place to place to avoid the snares of his enemies; yet still his faith continued so steadfast that he never alienated himself from the people of God. Others accounted him a lost man, and one whose affairs were in a hopeless condition, setting no more value upon him than if he had been a rotten limb, <span class="cite-ref">(242)</span> yet he never separated himself from the body of the Church. And certainly these words, <em>Flee ye, </em>tended only to make him yield to utter despair. But it would have been wrong for him to have yielded to these fears, and to have betaken himself to flight, as if uncertain of what would be the issue. He therefore says expressly, that this <em>was spoken to his soul, </em>meaning that his heart was deeply pierced by such an ignominious rejection, since he saw (as I have said) that it tended only to shake and to weaken his faith. In short, although he had always lived innocently, as it became a true servant of God, yet these malignant men would have doomed him to remain for ever in a state of exile from his native country. This verse teaches us, that however much the world may hate and persecute us, <span class="cite-ref">(243)</span> we ought nevertheless to continue steadfast at our post, that we may not deprive ourselves of a right to lay claim to the promises of God, or that these may not slip away from us; and that, however much and however long we may be harassed, we ought always to continue firm and unwavering in the faith of our having the call of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(238)</span> Calvin’s meaning is, that according to the Hebrew letters, the verb is in the plural number; but according to the Hebrew punctuation, which regulates the reading, it is in the singular. <em>Piscator</em>, in his commentary on this passage, observes, <span class="lang he-il">נודו</span>, <em>nudi, </em>according to the points, is singular and feminine, and refers to the soul of David; according to the letters it is plural, <span class="lang he-il">נודו</span>, <em>nudu, </em>and refers to David and his associates. This last reading appears to me the most appropriate, both because it is followed by the relative in the plural number, and because it does not seem to be a proper or natural mode of expression, to speak of persons addressing the soul of another” The phrase, <em>to my soul, </em>however, may simply mean <em>to me, </em>a sense in which it is frequently used in Scripture. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(239)</span> This is the reading adopted by the Chaldee, Septuagint, and Vulgate versions. <em>Hammond </em>observes, that “where the Hebrew now reads, <span class="lang he-il">הרכם צפור</span><em>, har kemo tsippor, To your mountain a sparrow, </em>all the ancient interpreters uniformly read, <em>To the mountain as a sparrow.” Horsley </em>translates the words, “Flee, sparrows, to your hill,” and views the expression “as proverbial, denoting a situation of helplessness and danger, in which there was no hope of safety but in flight” The noun, <span class="lang he-il">צפור</span><em>tsippor, </em>which he renders <em>sparrows, </em>is singular, and it is here construed with a plural verb and a plural pronoun. But he remarks, that as this word, like most names of animals in the Hebrew language, signifies either the individual or the species, it may here be used in the singular number for many individuals, and construed with plural verbs, adjectives, and pronouns. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(240)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sans specifier a qui est ceste montagne</span>. —<em>Fr. </em>“Without specifying whose mountain it is.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(241)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Je response que combien qu’il n’ait non plus este arrestd qu’un poure oiselet craintif qui saute de branche en branche</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(242)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien que les autres le tenissent pour un homme perdu et duquel les affaires estoyent bors d’espoir et qu’ils n’en felssent non plus de casque d’un membre pourri</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(243)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nous deteste et poursuyve</span>.” —<em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
