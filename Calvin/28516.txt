<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>Because the time is short</em>, etc. Again he discourses respecting the holy use of marriage, for the purpose of repressing the wantonness of those who, when they have married, think of nothing but the delights of the flesh. They have no remembrance of God. Hence he exhorts believers not to give way to unbridled desire in such a way, that marriage should have the effect of plunging them into the world. Marriage is a remedy for incontinency. It has really the effect, if it be used with moderation. He therefore exhorts married persons to live together chastely in the fear of the Lord. This will be effected, if marriage is made use of by them, like other helps of this earthly life, having their hearts directed upwards to meditation on the heavenly life. Now, he draws his argument from the shortness of human life: “This life,” says he, “which we are now spending is frail, and of short duration. Let us not therefore be held entangled by it. Let <em>those </em>accordingly <em>who have wives, be as though they had none</em>. ” Every one, it is true, has this philosophy in his mouth, but few have it truly and in good earnest impressed upon their minds. In my first translation, I had followed a manuscript, to which (as I afterwards discovered) not one of the many others gave any countenance. I have accordingly deemed it proper to insert the particle <em>because</em>, to make the meaning more apparent, and in accordance also with the reading in some ancient copies. For as in those cases in which we are deliberating as to anything, we look to the future rather than to the past, he admonishes us as to the shortness of the time that is to come. </p><p><em>As though they had none </em>All things that are connected with the enjoyment of the present life are sacred gifts of God, but we pollute them when we abuse them. If the reason is asked, we shall find it to be this, that we always dream of continuance in the world, for it is owing to this that those things which ought to be helps in passing through it become hindrances to hold us fast. Hence, it is not without good reason, that the Apostle, with the view of arousing us from this stupidity, calls us to consider the shortness of this life, and infers from this, that we ought to <em>use </em>all the things of this world, as <em>if we did not use </em>them. For the man who considers that he is a stranger in the world uses the things of this world as if they were another’s — that is, as things that are lent us for a single day. The sum is this, that the mind of a Christian ought not to be taken up with earthly things, or to repose in them; for we ought to live as if we were every moment about to depart from this life. By <em>weeping </em>and <em>rejoicing</em>, he means adversity and prosperity; for it is customary to denote causes by their effects. <span class="cite-ref">(424)</span> The Apostle, however, does not here command Christians to part with their possessions, but simply requires that their minds be not engrossed in their possessions. <span class="cite-ref">(425)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(424)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Or de prosperite s’ensuit ioye, comme d’aduersitez pleurs</span>;” — “Now joy is attendant on prosperity, as tears are on adversities.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(425)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Enterrez en icelles</span>;” — “Buried in them.” </p></div></div>
