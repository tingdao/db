<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Thou hast visited the earth, and watered it </em>This and the verbs which follow denote action continually going forward, and may therefore be rendered in the present tense. The exact meaning of the second verb in the sentence has been disputed. Some derive it from the verb <span class="lang he-il">שוק</span>, <em>shuk, </em>signifying <em>to desire; </em>and giving this meaning, that God visits the earth after it has been made dry and thirsty by long drought. <span class="cite-ref">(456)</span> Others derive it from the verb <span class="lang he-il">שקה</span>, <em>shakah, </em>signifying <em>to give drink. </em>This seems the most natural interpretation — <em>Thou visitest the earth by watering it. </em>It suits the connection better, for it follows, <em>thou plentifully enrichest it, </em>an expression obviously added by way of amplification. Whether the Psalmist speaks of Judea only, or of the world at large, is a point as to which different opinions may be held. I am disposed myself to think, that although what he says applies to the earth generally, he refers more particularly to Judea, as the former part of the psalm has been occupied with recounting the kindness of God to his own Church and people more especially. This view is confirmed by what is added, <em>the stream </em>or <em>river of God is full of water </em>Some take the <em>river of God </em>to mean a great or mighty river, <span class="cite-ref">(457)</span> but such a rendering is harsh and overstrained, and on that supposition, <em>rivers, </em>in the plural number, would have been the form of expression used. I consider that he singles out the small rivulet of Siloah, <span class="cite-ref">(458)</span> and sets it in opposition to the natural rivers which enrich other countries, intending an allusion to the word of Moses, (<span class="bvs">Deu_11:10</span>,) that the land which the Lord their God should give unto his people would not be as the land of Egypt, fertilized by the overflowings of the Nile, but a land drinking water of the rain of heaven. Or we may suppose that he calls the rain itself metaphorically <em>the river of God </em><span class="cite-ref">(459)</span> The words must, at any rate, be restricted to Judea, as by <em>the pastures </em>or <em>dwellings of the wilderness, </em>we are also to understand the more dry and uncultivated districts, called in Scripture “the hill country.” But while it is the kindness of God to his own people which is here more particularly celebrated as being better known, we are bound, in whatever part of the world we live, to acknowledge the riches of the Divine goodness seen in the earth’s fertility and increase. It is not of itself that it brings forth such an inexhaustible variety of fruits, but only in so far as it has been fitted by God for producing the food of man. Accordingly, there is a propriety and force in the form of expression used by the Psalmist when he adds, that <em>corn is provided for man, because the earth has been so prepared by God; </em><span class="cite-ref">(460)</span> which means, that the reason of that abundance with which the earth teems, is its having been expressly formed by God in his fatherly care of the great household of mankind, to supply the wants of his children. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(456)</span> This is the sense preferred by Aben Ezra and Kimchi. <em>Thou hast visited in mercy</em>; <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , blessed the earth <em>or </em>land, <em>after thou hast made it dry or thirsty</em>; <em>thou hast </em>or <em>dost enrich it greatly</em>; <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , thou, the same God, who hast punished and made thirsty dost again return in mercy, enriching the land and restoring plenty to it. Thus it was after the three years’ famine recorded in <span class="bvs">2Sa_21:1</span>. But the Septuagint, Arabic, Chaldee, and Syriac versions, interpret the word in the sense of <em>watering</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(457)</span> Some think reference is made to the overflowing of the Jordan after a long drought. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(458)</span> This river ran through Jerusalem, the city of God. Bishop Hare, following Simeon de Muis, is of opinion that this river is meant. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(459)</span> “<em>The stream of God</em>, <em>i e</em>. , copious rain, according to the Oriental idiom.” — <em>Dr Geddes</em>. See p. 7, note 1, of this volume. And without supposing this Hebraism, the treasures of water which descend from the clouds may, with great poetical beauty, be termed <em>the river of God </em>He collects them there by the wonderful process of evaporation, and he pours them down. They are entirely in his hand, and absolutely beyond the control of man. “The keys of the clouds,” say the Jews, “are peculiarly kept in God’s hand, as the keys of life and resurrection.” He can employ them as the instruments of his mercy, by pouring down from them upon the earth copious and refreshing showers, to promote vegetation and produce fruitful seasons; and he can also make them when he pleases the instruments of judgment, either by bottling them up, or by pouring from them floods of rain, as in the deluge, and when the harvest is made a heap in the day of grief and desperate sorrow, <span class="bvs">Isa_17:11</span>. Horsley, instead of <span class="lang he-il">פלג</span>, <em>peleg</em>, in the singular, proposes to read <span class="lang he-il">פלגות</span>, <em>pelagoth</em>, in the plural, and translates, “God is he who filleth the rivulets with water.” “The word <span class="lang he-il">פלג</span>,” says he, “as remarked by “Archbishop Secker, is very rarely used as a noun in the singular number. Mr Bates, indeed, takes it to be a noun in <span class="bvs">Psa_55:9</span>; but his interpretation of that text is very doubtful. In the plural it never signifies large rivers, but small brooks and rivulets. We have the authority of the Syriac for reading it in the plural.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(460)</span> In the Septuagint the last clause reads, “<span class="lang el-gr">Οτι οὕτῶς ἡ ἑτοιμασία</span>,” “For thus is the preparation;” that is, the earth was thus prepared. In the Syriac it is, “When thou didst found or establish it;” and in the Chaldee, “Seeing thou hast so founded it.” </p></div></div>
