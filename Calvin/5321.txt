<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>At the end of every seven years</em>. A special act of humanity towards each other is here prescribed to the Jews, that every seven years, brother should remit to brother whatever was owed him. But, although we are not bound by this law at present, and it would not be even expedient that it should be in use, still the object to which it tended ought still to be maintained, <em>i e</em>. , that we should not be too rigid in exacting our debts, especially if we have to do with the needy, who are bowed down by the burden of poverty. The condition of the ancient people, as I have said, was different. They derived their origin from a single race; the land of Canaan was their common inheritance; fraternal association was to be mutually sustained among them, just as if they were one family: and, inasmuch as God had once enfranchised them, the best plan for preserving’ their liberty for ever was to maintain a condition of mediocrity, lest a few persons of immense wealth should oppress the general body. Since, therefore, the rich, if they had been permitted constantly to increase in wealth, would have tyrannized over the rest, God put by this law a restraint on immoderate power. Moreover, when rest was given to the land, and men reposed from its cultivation, it was just that the whole people, for whose sake the Sabbath was instituted, should enjoy some relaxation. Still the remission here spoken of was, in my opinion, merely temporary. Some, indeed, suppose that all debts were then entirely cancelled; <span class="cite-ref">(144)</span> as if the Sabbatical year destroyed all debtor and creditor accounts; but this is refuted by the context, for when the Sabbatical year is at hand, God commands them to lend freely, whereas the contract would have been ridiculous, unless it had been lawful to seek repayment in due time. Surely, if no payment had ever followed, it would have been required simply to give: for what would the empty form of lending have availed if the money advanced was never to be returned to its owner? But God required all suits to cease for that year, so that no one should trouble his debtor: and, <em>because </em>in that year of freedom and immunity there was no hope of receiving back the money, God provides against the objection, and forbids them to be niggardly, although the delay might produce some <em>inconvenience</em>. First of all, therefore, He commands them to make a remission in the seventh year, <em>i e</em>. , to abstain from exacting their debts, and to concede to the poor, as well as to the land, a truce, or vacation. On which ground Isaiah reproves the Jews for observing the Sabbath amiss, when they exact <span class="cite-ref">(145)</span> their debts, and “fast for strife and debate.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_58:3</span>.) The form of remission is added, That no one should vex his neighbor in the year in which the release of God is proclaimed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(144)</span> “The Hebrews (says Ainsworth) for the most part hold the remission to be perpetual.” He, however, argues from the word <span class="lang he-il">שמטה</span>, <em>an intermission</em>, and its use in that sense in <span class="bvs">Exo_23:11</span>, that <em>C</em>. ’ <em>s </em>interpretation is the correct one. So also Dathe, who quotes Jos. Meyer in his Treatise on the Festivals of the Jews, ch. 17 sec. 20; and Michaelis, in his Laws of Moses, P. 3. sec. 157. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(145)</span><em>A.
