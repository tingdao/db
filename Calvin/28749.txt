<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>I die daily </em>Such a contempt of death he declares to be in himself, that he may not seem to talk bravely when beyond the reach of danger. <em>“I </em>am every <em>day,” </em>says he, “incessantly beset with death. What madness were it in me to undergo so much misery, if there were no reward in reserve for me in heaven? Nay more, if my glory and bliss lie in this world, why do I not rather <em>enjoy </em>them, than of my own accord <em>resign </em>them?” He says that he <em>dies daily, </em>because he was constantly beset with dangers so formidable and so imminent, that death in a manner was impending over him. A similar expression occurs in <span class="bvs">Psa_44:22</span>, and we shall, also, find one of the same kind occurring in the second Epistle. (<span class="bvs">2Co_11:23</span>.) </p><p><em>By our glory. </em>The old translation reads <em>propter, (because </em>of,) <span class="cite-ref">(75)</span> but it has manifestly arisen from the ignorance of transcribers; for in the Greek particle <span class="cite-ref">(76)</span> there is no ambiguity. It is then an oath, by which he wished to arouse the Corinthians, to be more attentive in listening to him, when reasoning as to the matter in hand. <span class="cite-ref">(77)</span><em>“Brethren, </em>I am not some philosopher prattling in the shade. <span class="cite-ref">(78)</span> As I expose myself every day to death, it is necessary that I should think in good earnest of the heavenly life. Believe, therefore, a man who is thoroughly experienced.” </p><p>It is also a form of oath that is not common, but is suited to the subject in hand. Corresponding to this was that celebrated oath of Demosthenes, which is quoted by Fabius, <span class="cite-ref">(79)</span> when he swore by the Shades of those who had met death in the field of Marathon, while his object was to exhort them to defend the Republic. <span class="cite-ref">(80)</span> So in like manner Paul here swears by <em>the glory which Christians have in Christ. </em>Now that glory is in heaven. He shows, then, that what they called in question was a matter of which he was so well assured, that he was prepared to make use of a sacred oath — a display of skill which must be carefully noticed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(75)</span> The rendering in Wiclif (1380) is — <em>for youre glorie. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(76)</span> The particle <span class="lang el-gr">νὴ</span>, made use of in solemn protestation. — Ed. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(77)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Veu qu’il parloit a bon escient, ayant luy-mesme les mains a la besongne, ainsi qu’ on dit</span>;” — “Inasmuch as he spoke in good earnest, having himself his hands in the work, as they say.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(78)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quelque Philosophe qui triomphe de dire, estant loin de la prattique</span>;” — “Some Philosopher, that talks loftily, while far from the scene of action.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(79)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lequel Quintilian allegue</span>;” — “Which Quintilian quotes.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(80)</span> “Quid denique Demosthenes? non illud jusjurandum per caesos in Marathone ac Salamine propugnatores reipublicae, satis manifesto docet, praeceptorem ejus Platonem fuisse ?” — “What in fine as to Demosthenes?
