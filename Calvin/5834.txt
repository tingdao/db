<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And of Naphtali he said. </em>He predicts that God would deal bountifully towards these two tribes; for to the first a fertile district would be allotted towards “the west and the south.” What he declares respecting the tribe of Asher is not free from ambiguity; for he is said to be blessed, <span class="lang he-il">מבנים</span>, <em>mibanim, </em>i.e., either <em>with </em>children, or <em>above </em>children. If we prefer the former meaning, his prolificness (<span class="lang el-gr">πολυτεκνία</span>) is celebrated, as though it were said, Asher shall be blessed with a numerous progeny. There may, however, be a comparison between this tribe and the others; and this might justly be made to its advantage, because it had a very fertile district allotted to it, and abounding in wheat of the best quality, as the blessing of Jacob testifies, </p><p>“Out of Asher shall bread be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.” (<span class="bvs">Gen_49:20</span>.) </p><p>He adds that “Asher shall be acceptable to his brethren;” from whence we gather that his tribe should be of a placid disposition: and afterwards figuratively celebrates the abundance of his oil, and iron, and brass. For to “dip his foot in oil,” is as much as to say that he should collect an abundant supply of oil; and that “his shoes should be iron and brass,” is nothing more than that he should tread upon a soil full of these metals. It is to be readily inferred from hence, as from preceding passages, that the blessings, which are now mentioned, are not so much wishes or prayers, as prophecies; since without the spirit of prophecy Moses could never have divined what, or what sort of, territory was to be bestowed on the several tribes. </p><p>Commentators vary as to the latter words; for some render the word <span class="lang he-il">דבא</span>, <em>daba, old age, </em>or, <em>grief, as </em>if there were a transposition of the letters, <span class="cite-ref">(325)</span> and thus restrict the meaning of the word “days” to youth; but others more correctly suppose, that Asher was to be strong and vigorous through the whole course of his life. Since, therefore, years gradually debilitate men, Moses promises to the posterity of Asher that their rigor should be retained to the very end of life. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(325)</span><span class="lang he-il">דבא</span>, a word whose root does not occur in Hebrew. The <em>LXX</em>. , and the Chaldee paraphrast, and the Syriac, are unanimous in rendering it <em>strength; </em>but the <em>V</em>. has <em>old age, </em>and those critics, who maintain this to be its meaning, are driven to suppose that it is formed irregularly from <span class="lang he-il">דאב</span> — <em>W </em></p></div></div>
