<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>For he flattereth himself in his own eyes </em>Here the Psalmist shows by their fruits or the marks of their character, that there is no fear of God among the wicked, seeing they take such pleasure in committing deeds of wickedness, that, although hateful in the sight of all other men, they still cherish the natural obstinacy of their hearts, and wilfully harden themselves in their evil course. First, he says that they nourish their vices by flatteries, <span class="cite-ref">(3)</span> that they may not be dissatisfied with themselves in sinning. But when he adds, <em>until their iniquity be found to be hateful, </em>by these words he is to be understood as referring to their determined obstinacy; for the meaning is, that while they falsely flatter themselves, they proceed to such an extent in their evil course, that their iniquity becomes hateful to all men. Some translate the words thus: <em>So that he himself finds his own iniquity to be hateful; </em>and understand them as meaning, that the wicked persist in rushing headlong into sin without restraint, until, satiated or glutted with the indulgence of their depraved desires, they begin to loathe it: for even the most depraved are sometimes dissatisfied with themselves on account of their sinful conduct. The first interpretation is, however, the more natural, namely, that the wicked, though they are hateful to all men on account of their iniquity, which, when once discovered and made manifest, excites a general feeling of displeasure, are not affected by any displeasure against themselves, but, on the contrary, rather applaud themselves, whilst the people despise them, and abhor the wickedness of their lives. The prophet, therefore, condemns them for their infatuation in this, that while all others are offended at their disgraceful conduct, they themselves are not at all affected by it. As far as in them lies, they abolish all distinction between good and evil, and lull their conscience into a state of insensibility, lest it should pain them, and urge them to repentance. Certainly the infatuation here described ought to be the subject of our serious consideration, the infatuation which is manifested in this, that men who are given up to a reprobate mind, while they render themselves hateful in the sight of all other men, are notwithstanding destitute of all sense of their own sins. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(3)</span> The verb <span class="lang he-il">חלף</span>, <em>chalak</em>, which is rendered <em>flattereth</em>, signifies <em>to smooth</em>, and means here, that the wicked man described endeavors by plausible arguments to put a soft, smooth, and fair gloss on his wickedness, as if there were nothing repulsive and hateful about it, nothing amiss or blame-worthy in it; and in this way he deceives himself. This is the sense expressed in the literal translation of Montanus, which seems very forcible: “Quoniam lenivit ad se in oculis ipsius, ad inveniendum iniquitatem suam ad odiendam.” — “For he has smoothed over [or set a polish] to himself in his own eyes, with respect to the finding out of his iniquity, [that is, so as not to find it out,] to hate it.” Horsley reads, </p><p>“For he giveth things a fair appearance to himself, <LineBreak />In his own eyes, so that he discovers not his own <LineBreak />iniquityto hate it.” </p><p>“He sets such a false gloss,“ says this critic, “in his own eyes, upon his worst actions, that he never finds out the blackness of his iniquity, which, were it perceived by him, would be hateful even to himself.” The wicked in all ages have thus contrived to put a fair appearance upon the most unprincipled maxims and pernicious practices. It will be seen that Montanus’ and Horsley’s translation of the last clause of the verse gives a different meaning from that given by Calvin. The original text is somewhat obscure and ambiguous from its brevity; but it seems to support the sense given by these critics. The Hebrew is, <span class="lang he-il">למצא עונולשנא</span>, <em>limtso avono lisno</em>, <em>to find</em>, or <em>to</em>, <em>for</em>, or <em>concerning the finding of</em>, [the first word being an infinitive with the prefix <span class="lang he-il">ל</span>, <em>lamed</em>, ] <em>his iniquity to hate </em>[<em>it</em>. ] “The prefix <span class="lang he-il">ל</span>,” says Walford, “cannot, I imagine, be translated with any propriety by <em>until</em>. ” His rendering is, </p><p>“For he flattereth himself in his own sight, <LineBreak />That his iniquity will not be found to be hateful:” </p><p>That is, will not be viewed by others as the hateful thing which it really is. The original words will easily bear this sense as well as that given by Montanus and Horsley. </p></div></div>
