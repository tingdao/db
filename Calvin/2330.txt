<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>And thou shalt make a plate. </em>It is not without reason that this inscription is placed upon the priest’s forehead, that it may be conspicuous; for not only did God thus testify that the legal priesthood was approved of, and acceptable to Him, since He had consecrated it by His word, but also that holiness was not to be sought elsewhere. These two things, then, are to be observed, —<em>first, </em>that the priesthood of His own appointment is pleasing to God, and so, that all others, however magnificently they may be spoken of, are abominable to Him, and rejected by Him; and <em>secondly, </em>that out of Christ we are all corrupt, and all our worship faulty; and however excellent our actions may seem, that they are still unclean and polluted. Thus, therefore, let all our senses remain fixed on the forehead of our sole and perpetual Priest, that we may know that from Him alone purity flows throughout the whole Church. To this His words refer, </p><p>"For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_17:19</span>;) </p><p>and the same thing is expressed in this passage of Moses, “that Aaron may hear the iniquity of the holy things,” etc. It is undoubtedly a remarkable passage, whereby, we are taught that nothing proceeds from us pleasing to God except through the intervention of the grace of the Mediator; for here there is no reference to manifest and gross sins, <span class="cite-ref">(167)</span> the pardon of which it is clear that we can only obtain through Christ; but the iniquity of the holy oblations was to be taken away and cleansed by the priest. That is but a poor exposition of it, that if any error were committed in the ceremonies, it was remitted in answer to the prayers of the priest; for we must look further, and understand that on this account the iniquity of the offerings must be purged by the priest, because no offering, in so far as it is of man, is altogether free from guilt. This is a harsh saying, and almost a paradox, that our very holinesses are so impure as to need pardon; but it must be borne in mind that nothing is so pure as not to contract some stain from us; just as water, which, although it may be drawn in purity from a limpid fountain, yet, if it passes over muddy ground, is tinged by it, and becomes somewhat turbid: thus nothing is so pure in itself as not to be polluted by the contagion of our flesh. Nothing is more excellent than the service of God; and yet the people could offer nothing, even although prescribed by the Law, except with the intervention of pardon, which none but the priest could obtain for them. There is now no sacrifice, nor was there ever, more pleasing to God than the invocation of His name, as He himself declares, </p><p>"Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_50:15</span>;) </p><p>yet the Apostle teaches us that “the sacrifice of praise” only pleases God when it is offered in Christ. (<span class="bvs">Heb_13:15</span>.) Let us learn, then, that our acts of obedience, when they come into God’s sight, are mingled with iniquity, which exposes us to His judgment, unless Christ should sanctify them. In sum, this passage teaches us that whatsoever good works we strive to present to God are so far from deserving reward, that they rather convict us of guilt, unless the holiness of Christ, whereby God is propitiated, obtains pardon for them. And this is again asserted immediately afterwards, where Moses says that by favor of the priest the sins of the sacred oblations are taken away <span class="cite-ref">(168)</span> “for favorable acceptation,” <em>i.e., </em>that the Israelites may be sure that God is reconciled and favorable to them. I have nothing to say of the tiara itself, which some call a mitre, (<em>cidarim,</em>) and others a cap; neither do I choose to philosophize too subtilely about the belt or girdle. <span class="cite-ref">(169)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(167)</span> Addition in <em>Fr., “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Et qu’on puisse condamner par le sens commun</span>;” and which even common sense must condemn. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(168)</span><em>Lat., “ </em>In beneplacitum.” <em>A.
