<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>For if I pray in another tongue. </em><span class="cite-ref">(827)</span> While this example, too, serves to confirm what he has previously maintained, it forms, at the same time, in my opinion, an additional particular. For it is probable that the Corinthians had been in fault in this respect also, that, as they discoursed, so they also prayed in foreign tongues. At the same time, both abuses took their rise from the same source, as indeed they were comprehended under one class. What is meant by <em>praying in a tongue, </em><span class="cite-ref">(828)</span> appears from what goes before — to frame a prayer in a foreign language. </p><p>The meaning of the term <em>spirit, </em>however, is not so easily explained. The idea of Ambrose, who refers it to the Spirit that we receive in baptism, has not only no foundation, but has not even the appearance of it. Augustine takes it in a more refined way, as denoting that apprehension, which conceives ideas and signs of things, so that it is a faculty of the soul that is inferior to the understanding. There is more plausibility in the opinion of those who interpret it as meaning the breathing of the throat — that is, the breath. This interpretation, however, does not accord with the meaning which the term invariably bears in Paul’s discussion in this place: nay more, it appears to have been repeated the oftener by way of concession. For they gloried in that honorary distinction, which Paul, it is true, allows them, while, on the other hand, he shows how preposterous it is to abuse <span class="cite-ref">(829)</span> a thing that is good and <em>excellent. </em>It is as though he had said — “Thou makest thy boast to me of <em>spirit, </em>but to what purpose, if it is useless?” From this consideration, I am led to agree with Chrysostom, as to the meaning of this term, who explains it, as in the previous instance, (<span class="bvs">1Co_14:12</span>,) to mean a spiritual gift. Thus <em>my spirit </em>will <em>mean </em>— <em>the gift conferred upon me. </em><span class="cite-ref">(830)</span></p><p>But here a new question arises; for it is not <em>credible </em>(at least we nowhere read of it) that any spoke under the influence of the Spirit in a language that was to themselves unknown. For the gift of tongues was conferred — not for the mere purpose of uttering a sound, but, on the contrary, with the view of making a communication. For how ridiculous a thing it would be, that the tongue of a Roman should be framed by the Spirit of God to pronounce Greek words, which were altogether unknown to the speaker, as parrots, magpies, and crows, are taught to mimic human voices! If, on the other hand, the man who was endowed with the gift of tongues, did not speak without sense and understanding, Paul would have had no occasion to say, that <em>the spirit prays, but the understanding is unfruitful, </em>for the <em>understanding </em>must have been conjoined with the <em>spirit </em></p><p>I answer, that Paul here, for the sake of illustration, makes a supposition, that had no reality, in this way: “If the gift of tongues be disjoined from the understanding, so that he who speaks is a <em>barbarian </em>to himself, as well as to others, what good would he do by babbling in this manner?” For it does not, appear that the mind is here said to be <em>unfruitful, ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἄκαρπον</span><em>) </em>on the ground of no advantage accruing to the Church, inasmuch as Paul is here speaking of the private prayers of an individual. Let us therefore keep it in view, that things that are connected with each other are here disjoined for the sake of illustration — not on the ground that it either can, or usually does, so happen. The meaning is now obvious. “If, therefore, I frame prayers in a language that is not understood by me, and the <em>spirit </em>supplies me with words, the <em>spirit </em>indeed itself, which regulates my tongue, will in that case <em>pray, </em>but my mind will either be wandering somewhere else, or at least will have no part in the prayer.” </p><p>Let us take notice, that Paul reckons it a great fault if the mind is not occupied in prayer. And no wonder; for what else do we in prayer, but pour out our thoughts and desires before God? Farther, as prayer is the spiritual worship of God, what is more at variance with the nature of it, than that it should proceed merely from the lips, and not from the inmost soul? And these things must have been perfectly familiar to every mind, had not the devil besotted the world to such a degree, as to make men believe that they pray aright, when they merely make their lips move. So obstinate, too, are Papists in their madness, that they do not merely justify the making of prayers without understanding, but even prefer that the unlearned should mutter in unknown mumblings. <span class="cite-ref">(831)</span> Meanwhile they mock God by an acute sophism <span class="cite-ref">(832)</span> — that the <em>final intention </em>is enough, or, in other words, that it is an acceptable service to God, if a Spaniard curses God in the German language, while in his mind he is tossed with various profane cares, provided only he shall, by setting himself to his form of prayer, make up matters with God by means of a thought that quickly vanishes. <span class="cite-ref">(833)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(827)</span> “What is it,” says <em>Witsius</em>, (in his “Sacred Dissertations,”) “to pray with the <em>tongue </em>? with the <em>spirit </em>? with the <em>mind </em>? (<span class="bvs">1Co_14:14</span>.) The <em>tongue </em>means here a language unknown to others, and employed by one who is endowed with a supernatural gift of the Holy Spirit. To <em>pray with the tongue</em>, is to pray in a language unknown to others; as, for instance, to pray in the Hebrew language in presence of Greeks. In that sense he had said, (<span class="bvs">1Co_14:2</span>,) ‘He that speaketh with the tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth him;’ that is, he who speaks in a foreign tongue, the knowledge of which he has acquired by an extraordinary gift of the Spirit, has God only for a witness. He cannot reckon as his witnesses, or as persons aware of what he is doing, those who are ignorant of the language, and to whose edification he has contributed little or nothing. The <em>spirit </em>means here that extraordinary gift, by which a man is led to act in a certain way, accompanied by almost ecstatic emotions, so that sometimes he is neither aware what he says, nor do others understand what he means. To <em>pray with the Spirit</em>, is to pray in such a manner as to show that you feel the presence of an extraordinary gift of the Spirit, which moves and hurries you along, in a powerful manner, to those actions which excite astonishment. <span class="lang el-gr">Νους</span>,<em>intelligence</em>, <em>mind</em>, seems here to be chiefly used in a transitive sense, to mean what we give another to understand. Such is the meaning of, <span class="lang he-il">תבונה</span>, to which <span class="lang el-gr">νους</span> corresponds. <span class="lang he-il">חט אזנך לתבונתי</span>,<em>incline thine ear to my understanding</em>, that is, to those things which I shall give thee to understand. (<span class="bvs">Pro_5:1</span>.) To <em>pray with the mind</em>, is to pray in such a manner that the prayers which you deliberately <em>conceive</em>, may be conceived and understood by others. Paul, accordingly, proposes himself as an example of the proper manner of conducting prayers. <em>If I pray in a tongue </em>unknown to the assembly in whose presence I pray, but which I have learned by Divine inspiration, <em>my spirit prayeth</em>, I am acting under the influence of that gift, which impels and arouses me to unusual and remarkable proceedings; but <em>my understanding is unfruitful</em>, I do not enable another to understand with advantage the conceptions of my mind. <em>What then </em>?<em>I will pray with the Spirit</em>; when the vehement emotion of the Spirit comes upon me, I will not struggle against it, <em>but I will pray with the understanding also</em>; I will show that I am not mad, but possessed of a sound understanding; and I will endeavor that others, as well as myself, be edified by my prayer.” Biblical Cabinet, volume 24. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(828)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que c’est que </span><em class="lang fr-fr">prier de langue</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, (car il y a ainsi mot a mot, la ou nous traduisons </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Prier en langage incognu</em><span class="lang fr-fr">)</span>;” — “What it is to <em>pray in a tongue</em>, for such is the literal meaning, where we render it — <em>to pray in an unknown language</em>. ” Wilclif (1380) gives the literal rendering — <em>For if I preie in tunge</em>. Tyndale, (1534,) <em>If I pray with tonges</em>. Cranmer, (1539,) <em>For if I praye with tongue</em>. Rheims, (1582,) <em>For if I pray with the tongue</em>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(829)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quel danger il y a, quand on abuse</span>;” — “What danger there is, when one abuses.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(830)</span> “What the Apostle means by <span class="lang el-gr">τὸ πνεῦμα μου</span>, (<em>my spirit</em>,) is, neither the Holy Spirit moving him to speak, nor any spiritual endowment with which he was gifted, but, as the phrase signifies in other passages in which it occurs, (<span class="bvs">Rom_1:9</span>; <span class="bvs">1Co_5:3</span>; <span class="bvs">2Ti_4:22</span>; <span class="bvs">Phl_1:25</span>,) <em>his own mind</em>, with which he engaged in the service. By <span class="lang el-gr">νοῦς</span>, as contrasted with this, it is manifest he cannot mean his faculty of understanding — for it is comprehended under the former. The word must, therefore, signify the <em>meaning </em>or <em>sense </em>which he attached to the language he employed — an acceptation in which he uses the term, <span class="bvs">1Co_14:19</span>. So far as he himself was concerned, he derived benefit — connecting, as he did, intelligent ideas with the words to which he gave utterance; but the meaning of what he uttered (<span class="lang el-gr">ἄκαρπος</span>) produced <em>no fruit </em>in the hearers, inasmuch as they did not understand him. It must be observed, however, that the Apostle is here only supposing a case, such as that which frequently presented itself in the Church at Corinth; not that he would have it to be believed that it ever occurred in his own experience. On the contrary, he avers that, whenever he engaged either in prayer or praise, it was in a way that was intelligible, and consequently profitable both to himself and others, <span class="lang el-gr">τῷ πνεύματι</span>, — <span class="lang el-gr">τῶ νωΐ</span>,<em>with the </em>spirit — <em>with the understanding</em>. ” Henderson on Inspiration. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(831)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais qui plus est, aiment mieux que les idiots et ignorans barbotent des patinostres en langage qui leur est incognu</span>;” — “But, what is more, they like better that unlearned and ignorant persons should mutter over paternosters in a language which they do not understand.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(832)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils ont vne solution bien aigue et peremptoire</span>;” — “They have a very acute and peremptory solution.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(833)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vne pensee esuanouissante en l’air, qu’ils appellent Intention finale</span>;” — “A thought vanishing into air, which they call final Intention.” </p></div></div>
