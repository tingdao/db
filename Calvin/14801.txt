<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>The God of my mercy will prevent me </em>In the Hebrew, there is the affix of the third person, but we have the point which denotes the first. <span class="cite-ref">(367)</span> The Septuagint has adopted the third person, and Augustine too ingeniously, though with a good design, has repeatedly quoted the passage against the Pelagians, in proof that the grace of God is antecedent to all human merit. In the same manner, he has again and again cited the preceding verse, to refute the arrogancy of those who boast of the power of free-will. <em>“I will put in trust my strength with thee,” </em>he says; “that is, men must subject themselves with all modesty and humility to God, as having no strength but that with which he supplies them.” Now, it may be said with great plausibility, that the man <em>puts his strength in trust with God, </em>who declares that he has no strength but what comes from him, and who depends entirely upon his help. The sentiment inculcated is also, without all doubt, a pious and instructive one; but we must be ever on our guard against wresting Scripture from its natural meaning. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">קדמ</span>, <em>kidem, </em>means no more than <em>to come forward seasonably; </em>and David simply intimates that the divine assistance would be promptly and opportunely extended. <span class="cite-ref">(368)</span> The scope of the words is, that God will interpose at the very moment when it is required, however much he may retard or defer his assistance. Were it not that we are hurried on by the excessive eagerness of our own wishes, we would sufficiently recognize the promptness with which God hastens to our help, but our own precipitance makes us imagine that he is dilatory. To confirm his faith, he calls him <em>the God of his mercy, </em>having often proved him to be merciful; and the experience of the past afforded him good hopes of what he might expect in the future. The idea of some, that David uses the word in an active sense, and praises his own mercy, is poor and unnatural. Its passive use is quite common. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(367)</span> “We have <span class="lang he-il">חסדו</span>, <em>his mercy</em>, with the points <span class="lang he-il">חסדי</span>, <em>my mercy</em>, the <em>keri </em>being for the one, and the <em>kethib </em>for the other. And, accordingly, of the interpreters, some read the one, some the other, both certainly meaning the same thing: the Chaldee, ‘the God of my grace, <em>or </em>goodness, or mercy;’ but the LXX. ‘<span class="lang el-gr">Ο Θεός μοῦ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ</span>,’ ‘My God his mercy,’ and so the Latin.” —<em>Hammond </em>Green translates, “My God shall prevent me with his loving-kindness.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(368)</span> Horsley reads, “God shall give me ready help.” </p></div></div>
