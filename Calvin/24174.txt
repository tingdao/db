<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>44.</strong><em>And the robbers also. Matthew </em>and <em>Mark, </em>by synecdoche, attribute to the robbers what was done only by one of them, as is evident from Luke And this mode of expression ought not to be accounted harsh; for the two Evangelists had no other design than to show that Christ was attacked on every hand by the reproaches of all men, so that even <em>the robbers, </em>who were fast dying, did not spare him. In like manner David, deploring his calamities, exhibits their violence in a strong light by saying, that he is the reproach of all sorts of men, and despised by the people. Now although they leave out the memorable narrative which Luke relates as to the other <em>robber, </em>still there is no inconsistency in their statement, that Christ was despised by all, down to the very <em>robbers; </em>for they do not speak of particular individuals, but of the class itself. Let us now, therefore, come to what is stated by Luke </p></div>
