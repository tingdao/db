<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And when they saw it, they all murmured. </em>The inhabitants of the town — and, perhaps, some of Christ’s followers — <em>murmur </em>that <em>he goes to lodge with a man </em>who is looked upon as wicked and infamous, even though nobody invited him. It is thus that the world disregards the offer of the grace of God, but complains bitterly <span class="cite-ref">(678)</span> when it is conveyed to others. But let us consider how unjust this murmuring was. They think it unreasonable that Christ should bestows so great an honor on a wicked man; for in this passage, as in many others, the word <em>sinner </em>is not taken in the ordinary sense, <span class="cite-ref">(679)</span> but denotes a man of disgraceful and scandalous life. Let us suppose that <em>Zaccheus </em>was a person of this description. Still, we ought first to inquire for what purpose Christ chose to become his guest; for, while out of doors men are murmuring, <em>within </em>the house God displays magnificently the glory of this name, and refutes their wicked calumny. </p><p>The conversion of <em>Zaccheus </em>was an astonishing work of God, and yet there was no good reason why <em>Zaccheus </em>should be marked with infamy. He had the charge of collecting the taxes. Now to collect taxes was no crime in itself, but men of that class were exceedingly despised and hated by the Jews, because they reckoned it to be in the highest degree unjust that they should pay tribute. But whatever might be the character of <em>Zaccheus</em>, still the kindness of Christ ought not to be blamed, but commended, in not refusing his assistance to a wretched man, to rescue him from destruction, and bring him to salvation. And therefore the offense which was wickedly taken did not hinder him from proceeding to execute his Father’s command. With such magnanimity ought all his ministers to be endued, as to think more highly of the salvation of one soul than of the murmurs which all ignorant persons may utter, and not to desist from their duty, even though all their actions and words may expose them to reproaches. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(678)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et cependant est envieux et marri</span>;” — “and yet is envious and offended.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(679)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et ne signifie pas ce que communeement nous appelons </span><em class="lang fr-fr">pecheur </em><em>; </em>” — “and does not mean what we usually call <em>a sinner</em>. <em>” </em></p></div></div>
