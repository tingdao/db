And this is what he immediately adds, that we are <em>renewed after the image of God</em>. Now, the <em>image of God </em>resides in the whole of the soul, inasmuch as it is not the reason merely that is rectified, but also the will. Hence, too, we learn, on the one hand, what is the end of our regeneration, that is, that we may be made like God, and that his glory may shine forth in us; and, on the other hand, what is the image of God, of which mention is made by Moses in <span class="bvs">Gen_9:6</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(440)</span> the rectitude and integrity of the whole soul, so that man reflects, like a mirror, the wisdom, righteousness, and goodness of God. He speaks somewhat differently in the Epistle to the Ephesians, but the meaning is the same. See the passage — <span class="bvs">Eph_4:24</span>. Paul, at the same time, teaches, that there is nothing more excellent at which the Colossians can aspire, inasmuch as this is our highest perfection and blessedness to bear the image of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(440)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De laquelle Moyse fait mention au </span><span class="bvs">Gen_1:0</span><span class="lang fr-fr">, chap. c. 26, et 9, b. 6</span>;” — “Of which Moses makes mention in <span class="bvs">Gen_1:26</span>.” </p></div></div>
