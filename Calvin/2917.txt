<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>This is the law of the burnt-offering. </em>In this conclusion Moses indicates that full provision had been made lest any addition should insinuate itself from manâ€™s inventions to vitiate the sacrifices. In the day, he says, that God appointed the sacrifices to be offered to Him on Mount Sinai, He omitted nothing which was to be observed, lest men should dare to introduce anything except what He prescribed. And surely, when He had thus carefully embraced all the ceremonies, we may easily infer from hence how earnestly we should avoid all temerity and audacity in invention. The design, therefore, of Moses was in this brief admonition to exhort the people to soberness, lest they should transgress the limits placed by God. </p></div>
