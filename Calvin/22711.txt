<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet triumphs over the Assyrians, because they thought that the city Nineveh was remote from every danger: as lions, who fear nothing, when they are in their dens, draw thither their prey in their claws or in their mouths: so also was the case with the Assyrians; thinking themselves safe, while Nineveh flourished, they took the greater liberty to commit plunders everywhere. For Nineveh was not only the receptacle of robbers but was also like a den of lions. And the Prophet more fully expresses the barbarous cruelty of the Assyrians by comparing them to lions, than if he had simply called them lions. We now then see what he means, when he says, <em>Where is the place of lions? </em>And he designedly speaks thus of the Assyrians: for no one ever thought that they could be touched by even the least injury; the fear of them had indeed so seized all men, that of themselves they submitted to the Assyrians. As then no one dared to oppose them, the Prophet says, <em>Where? </em>as though he had said that though all thought it incredible that Nineveh could be overthrown, it would yet thus happen. But he assumes the character of one expressing his astonishment, in order to intimate, that when the Lord should execute such a judgment, it would be a work of wonder, which would fill almost all with amazement. This question then proves that those are very foolish who form a judgment of God’s vengeance, of which the Prophet speaks, according to the appearance of things at the time; for the ruin of Nineveh and of that empire was to be the incomprehensible work of God, and which was to fill all minds with astonishment. </p><p>He says first, <em>Where is the place of lions? </em>The feminine gender is indeed here used; but all agree that the Prophet speaks of male lions. <span class="cite-ref">(236)</span> He then adds<em>, the place of feeding for lions? </em><span class="lang he-il">כפרים</span>, <em>caphrim, </em>mean young lions as we shall hereafter see; and <span class="lang he-il">אריות</span>, <em>ariut, </em>are old lions. He afterwards adds, <em>Where </em><span class="lang he-il">אריה</span>, <em>arie came</em>: and then comes <span class="lang he-il">לביא</span>, <em>labia</em>, which some render, lioness; but <span class="lang he-il">לביא</span>, <em>labia, </em>properly means an old lion; the Prophet, no doubt, uses it in the next verse in the feminine gender for lionesses. I therefore do not deny, but that we may fitly render the terms here, lion and lioness; afterwards, and the whelp of lions, and none terrifying. He then adds, Seize did the lion (the word is <span class="lang he-il">אריה</span>, <em>arie</em>) for his whelps to satiety, that is, sufficiently; and strangle did he for his lionesses, <span class="lang he-il">ללבאתיו</span>, <em>lalabatiu</em>. Here no doubt the Prophet means lionesses; there would otherwise be no consistency in the passage. He afterwards says, </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(236)</span> It is better to retain the gender as it is in Hebrew: and this makes the passage more consistent, and corresponds better with the “feeding-place” in the next line. The recesses of the lionesses and the whelps are here mentioned, and in the next verse is stated what the lions did for them: — </p><p><em>11. Where </em>is <em>the haunt of the lionesses, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And the feeding-place, </em>even <em>that for the whelps, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Where did go the lion, the lioness, the cub of the lion, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And none made </em>them <em>afraid? </em></p><p>12. The lion ravined for the supply of his cubs, <LineBreak />And strangled for his lionesses, <LineBreak />And filled with ravin his dens, <LineBreak />And his haunts by ravining. </p><p>“The allegory,” says <em>Newcome, </em>“is beyond measure beautiful. Where are the inhabitants of Nineveh, who were strong and rapacious like lions?” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
