<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_5:29</span><strong>.</strong><em>And Levi made him a great banquet </em>This appears to be at variance with what Luke relates, that <em>he left all: </em>but the solution is easy. Matthew disregarded every hinderance, and gave up himself entirely to Christ, but yet did not abandon the charge of his own domestic affairs. When Paul, referring to the example of soldiers, exhorts the ministers of the word to be free and disentangled from every hinderance, and to devote their labors to the church, he says: </p><p>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of life, <LineBreak />that he may please the commander, (<span class="bvs">2Ti_2:4</span>.) </p><p>He certainly does not mean, that those who enroll themselves in the military profession divorce their wives, forsake their children, and entirely desert their homes; but that they quit their homes for a time, and leave behind them every care, that they may be wholly employed in war. In the same manner, nothing kept Matthew from following where Christ called; and yet he freely used both his house and his property, as far as the nature of his calling allowed. It was necessary, indeed, that he should leave the <em>custom-house: </em>for, had he been detained there, he would not have been a follower of Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(519)</span></p><p>It is called <em>a great banquet, </em>with reference not to the multitude of the guests, but to the abundance and magnificence of the provisions: for we know that Christ did not practise such austerity, as not to allow himself to be sometimes entertained more splendidly by the rich, provided that there were no superfluity. Yet we cannot doubt that, as he was a remarkable example of temperance, so he exhorted those who entertained him to frugality and moderation in diet, and would never have endured wasteful and extravagant luxuries. Matthew says that <em>sinners </em>—<em>that </em>is, men of wicked lives and of infamous <em>character </em>—<em>came </em>to the banquet. The reason was, that the <em>publicans, </em>being themselves generally hated and despised, did not disdain to associate with persons of that description; for, as moderate correction produces shame and humiliation in transgressors, so excessive severity drives some persons to despair, makes them leave off all shame, and abandon themselves to wickedness. In levying custom or taxes there was nothing wrong: but when the <em>publicans </em>saw themselves cast off as ungodly and detestable persons, they sought consolation in the society of those who did not despise them on account of the bad and disgraceful reputation which they shared along with them. Meanwhile, they mixed with adulterers, drunkards, and such characters; whose crimes they would have detested, and whom they would not have resembled, had not the public hatred and detestation driven them to that necessity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(519)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource qu'ayant cest empeschement, il n'eust pas peu suivre la compagnie de Christ</span>;” — “because, having that hinderance, he could not have followed the company of Christ.” </p></div></div>
