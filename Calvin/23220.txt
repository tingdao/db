<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Depart, Satan. </em>Instead of this, Luke has, <em>Depart behind me, Satan. </em>There is no use for speculating about the phrase, <em>behind me, </em>which Christ addressed to Peter, <em>Go behind me, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_16:23</span>,) as if the same words had not been addressed to Satan. Christ simply bids him go away; <span class="cite-ref">(315)</span> and now proceeds with the same kind of defense as before, employing Scripture as a shield, not of reeds, but of brass. He quotes a passage from the law, that God alone is to be adored and worshipped, (<span class="bvs">Deu_6:13</span>.) From the application of that passage, and from the circumstances in which it is introduced, it is easy to conclude what is the design of adoration of God, and in what it consists. </p><p>Papists deny that God only ought to be adored; and evade this and similar passages by sophistical arguments. <em>Latria </em><em>, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">λατρεία</span>,) they admit, is adoration, which ought to be given to God alone: but <em>Dulia </em><em>, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">δουλεία</span>,) is an inferior kind of adoration, which they bestow on dead men, and on their bones and statues. But Christ rejects this frivolous distinction, and claims for God alone <span class="lang el-gr">προσκύνησις</span>, <em>worship; </em>by which he warns us to attend more to the matter than to expressions, when we have to do with the worship of God. </p><p>Scripture enjoins us to <em>worship God alone: </em>we must inquire, for what end? If a man takes any thing from his glory, and ascribes it to creatures, this is a heinous profanation of divine worship. But it is very evident that this is done, when we go to creatures, to receive from them those good things, of which God desired to be acknowledged as the only Author. Now, as religion is strictly spiritual, and the outward acknowledgment of it relates to the body, so not only the inward worship, but also the outward manifestation of it, is due to God alone. <span class="cite-ref">(316)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(315)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il vent seulement le rejetter avec son conseil</span>;” — “he wishes only to reject him with his advice.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(316)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Christ attribue aussi a Dieu seul l'adoration externe, que les Grecs appellent</span><span class="lang el-gr">προσχύνησις: </span><span class="lang fr-fr">car il use de ce terme qui signifient proprement </span><em class="lang fr-fr">s'agenouiller ET prosterner </em><span class="lang fr-fr">par forme de service divin</span>.” — “Christ ascribes also to God alone the external adoration, which the Greeks call<span class="lang el-gr">προσχύνησις: </span> for he employs this term, which signifies literally to <em>kneel and bow down, </em>in a form of divine service.” </p></div></div>
