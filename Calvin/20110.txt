<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet intimates by anticipation, that how much soever the Moabites might boast, they could not, by their boastings and their pride, so succeed that God should not appear against them as a Judge. We have said already, that as the Moabites had been long in a quiet state, what the Prophet denounced on them, appeared at the first hearing as incredible. It is then by way of anticipation that he says, that the Moabites were <em>proud</em>, did swell with <em>haughtiness</em>, and breathed much <em>arrogance</em>, that, in short, they manifested high and lofty spirits. When the Prophet says all this, and adds, that nothing would avail them, we see that he meets those doubts which might have possessed weak minds, so as to prevent them to believe his prophecy. </p><p>And when he uses the words, <em>We have heard</em>, he not only means by report, but that the Moabites loudly boasted, as it is usual with proud men; for they made, so to speak, a bellowing, and sought, even by their tongues alone, to strike others with terror. As then they proclaimed their wealth and their power, they sought in a manner to shake the very air, so that all might tremble at their voice alone. This seems to have been expressed by the Prophet, when he said, <em>We have heard </em>In short, Jeremiah does not mean that the report of the pride of Moab had spread abroad, as rumors often fly respecting the haughtiness and boastings of men; but he intimates that the Moabites were heralds of their own power, so that they spoke in lofty terms of their own greatness, and thus their own tongues testified of their haughtiness and arrogance. <span class="cite-ref">(14)</span> And hence it was that the Prophet enlarged on their pride; Moab <em>is very proud</em>, he says; <em>we have heard his haughtiness, his pride and his arrogance</em>, (though it be the same word,) <em>and the loftiness of his heart</em>, or, as we may say in Latin, <em>et altos spiritus</em>, and his high sprits. It now follows — </p><p><strong>(14)</strong> Our version in <span class="bvs">Isa_16:6</span>, where the same form of words occurs, is, “We have heard of,” though here the “of” is dropped, and thus the meaning of <em>Calvin </em>is conveyed, which is favored by the early versions. </p><p>The verse may be thus literally rendered, — </p><p>We have heard the arrogance of Moab; Very arrogant <em>has been </em>his insolence and arrogance; Yea, his arrogantness and the loftiness of his heart. </p><p>The word for “arrogance” means swelling; it is to grow big, and to claim more than what belongs to us. Then “insolence” signifies to rise high, so as to look down on others with contempt. Arrogance is first, then insolence: and in the last line the two are inverted, and with this difference, the disposition is denoted in the last line, and the acting in the former. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
