<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27</strong><em>Only in a manner worthy of the gospel</em>. We make use of this form of expression, when we are inclined to pass on to a new subject. Thus it is as though he had said, “But as for me, the Lord will provide, but as for you, etc., whatever may take place as to me, let it be your care, nevertheless, to go forward in the right course.” When he speaks of a pure and honorable conversation as being worthy of the gospel, he intimates, on the other hand, that those who live otherwise do injustice to the gospel. </p><p><em>That whether I come </em>As the Greek phrase made use of by Paul is elliptical, I have made use of <em>videam </em><em>, (I see,) </em>instead of <em>videns </em><em>(seeing.) </em>If this does not appear satisfactory, you may supply the principal verb <em>Intelligam </em><em>, (I may learn,) </em>in this sense: “Whether, when I shall come and see you, or whether I shall, when absent, hear respecting your condition, I may learn in both ways, both by being present and by receiving intelligence, that ye <em>stand in one spirit. </em>” We need not, however, feel anxiety as to particular terms, when the meaning is evident. </p><p><em>Stand in one spirit </em>This, certainly, is one of the main excellences of the Church, and hence this is one means of preserving it in a sound state, inasmuch as it is torn to pieces by dissensions. But although Paul was desirous by means of this antidote to provide against novel and strange doctrines, yet he requires a twofold unity — of <em>spirit </em>and <em>soul</em>. The <em>first </em>is, that we have like views; the <em>second</em>, that we be united in heart. For when these two terms are connected together, <em>spiritus </em><em>(spirit) </em>denotes the <em>understanding</em>, while <em>anima </em><em>(soul) </em>denotes the <em>will</em>. Farther, agreement of views comes first in order; and then from it springs union of inclination. </p><p><em>Striving together for the faith </em>This is the strongest bond of concord, when we have to fight together under the same banner, for this has often been the occasion of reconciling even the greatest enemies. Hence, in order that he may confirm the more the unity that existed among the Philippians, he calls them to notice that they are fellow-soldiers, who, having a common enemy and a common warfare, ought to have their minds united together in a holy agreement. The expression which Paul has made use of in the Greek (<span class="lang el-gr">συναθλοῦντες τὣ πίστει</span>) is ambiguous. The old interpreter renders it <em>Collaborantes fidei </em><em>, (laboring together with the faith.) </em><span class="cite-ref">(83)</span> Erasmus renders it <em>Adiuvantes fidem </em><em>, (Helping the faith,) </em>as if meaning, that they gave <em>help </em>to the <em>faith </em>to the utmost of their power. As, however, the dative in Greek is made use of instead of the ablative of instrumentality, (that language having no ablative,) I have no doubt that the Apostle’s meaning is this: “Let the faith of the gospel unite you together, more especially as that is a common armory against one and the same enemy.” In this way the particle <span class="lang el-gr">σύν</span>, which others refer to <em>faith</em>, I take as referring to the Philippians, and with greater propriety, if I am not mistaken. In the first place, every one is aware how effectual an inducement it is to concord, when we have to maintain a conflict together; and farther, we know that in the spiritual warfare we are armed with the <em>shield of faith</em>, (<span class="bvs">Eph_6:16</span>,) for repelling the enemy; nay, more, faith is both our panoply and our victory. Hence he added this clause, that he might shew what is the end of a pious connection. The wicked, too, conspire together for evil, but their agreement is accursed: let us, therefore, contend with one mind under the banner of faith. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(83)</span> In accordance with the Vulgate, Wiclif (1380) renders as follows: “traueilynge to gidre to the feith of the gospel.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
