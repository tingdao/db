<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>And if any one strive </em>He now speaks of perseverance, that no man may think that he has done enough when he has been engaged in one or two conflicts. He borrows a comparison from wrestlers, not one of whom obtains the prize till he has been victorious in the end. Thus he says: </p><p>“In a race all run, but one obtaineth the prize;<LineBreak />run so that ye may obtain.” (<span class="bvs">1Co_9:24</span>.) </p><p>If any man, therefore, wearied with the conflict, immediately withdraw from the arena to enjoy repose, he will be condemned for indolence instead of being crowned. Thus, because Christ wishes us to strive during our whole life, he who gives way in the middle of the course deprives himself of honor, even though he may have begun valiantly. To <em>strive lawfully </em>is to pursue the contest in such a manner and to such an extent as the law requires, that none may leave off before the time appointed. </p></div>
