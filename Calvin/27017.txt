<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Whom the heaven must contain. </em>Because men’s senses are always bent and inclined towards the gross and earthly beholding of God and Christ, the Jews might think with themselves that Christ was preached, indeed, to be raised up from the dead, yet could they not tell where he was; for no man did show them where he was. Therefore Peter preventeth them, when he saith that he is in heaven. Whereupon it followeth that they must lift up their minds on high, to the end they may seek Christ with the eyes of faith, although he be far from them, <span class="cite-ref">(189)</span> although he dwell without the world in the heavenly glory. But this is a doubtful <span class="cite-ref">(190)</span> speech; because we may as well understand it that Christ is contained or comprehended in the heavens, as that he doth comprehend the heavens. Let us not therefore urge the word, being of a doubtful signification; but let us content ourselves with that which is certain, that we must seek for Christ nowhere else save only in heaven, whilst that we hope for the last restoring of all things; because he shall be far from us, until our minds ascend high above the world. </p><p><em>Until the time of restoring </em>As touching the force and cause, Christ hath already restored all things by his death; but the effect doth not yet fully appear; because that restoring is yet in the course, and se, consequently, our redemption, forasmuch as we do yet groan under the burden of servitude. For as the kingdom of Christ is only begun, and the perfection thereof is deferred until the last day, so those things which are annexed thereunto do now appear only in part. Therefore, if at this day we see many things confused in the world, let this hope set us upon foot and refresh us, that Christ shall once come that he may restore tall things. In the mean season, if we see the relics of sin hang on us, if we be environed on every side with divers miseries, if the world be full of wasting and scattering abroad, let us bewail these miseries, yet so that we uphold with the hope of restoring. And this is the reason why Christ doth not appear by and by, <span class="cite-ref">(191)</span> because the warfare of the Church is not yet full, <span class="cite-ref">(192)</span> whose time, seeing it is appointed by God, it is not for us to prevent the same. <span class="cite-ref">(193)</span></p><p><em>Which he spoke. </em>I do not expound this of the times alone, but I refer it unto the whole period; so that the sense is this: That whatsoever he had spoken before of the kingdom of Christ is witnessed by all the prophets. Certes, the gospel doth win no small credit hereby, that so soon as God began to show himself to the world, he did always set Christ before them; after that he began to speak unto the fathers, he did always lay this foundation of doctrine. By the same argument Paul commendeth the gospel, both in the beginning of his Epistle to the Romans, (<span class="bvs">Rom_1:1</span>,) and also in the end, (<span class="bvs">Rom_16:25</span>,) to wit, that it is no new thing, but promised even from the beginning. <span class="cite-ref">(194)</span> This is true antiquity, which is able to purchase credit to doctrine: when as God himself is the author, the holy prophets the witnesses, and the continual course of times confirmeth the testimony. This confirmation was especially necessary for the Jews, who being brought up in the doctrine of the law, ought to admit nothing but that which agreeth therewith. Therefore Peter doth command them only to mind those things which the prophets have testified of Christ. </p><p><strong>(189)</strong> “Quamvis immensa locorum distamia sit remotus,” although, in respect of place, he is at an immense distance from them. </p><p><strong>(190)</strong> “Ambigua lequtio,” an ambiguous expression. </p><p><strong>(191)</strong> “Statim,” immediately. </p><p><strong>(192)</strong> “Completa,” complete. </p><p><strong>(193)</strong> “Antivertere,” anticipate. </p><p><strong>(194)</strong> “Ab ultima aetate,” from the remotest age. </p></div>
