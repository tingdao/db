<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>I call God for a witness. </em>He now begins to assign a reason for his change of purpose; for hitherto he has merely repelled calumny. When, however, he says that <em>he spared them, </em>he indirectly throws back the blame upon them, and thus shows them that it would be unfair if he were put to grief through their fault, but that it would be much more unfair if they should permit this; but most of all unfair if they should give their assent to so base a calumny, as in that case they would be substituting in their place an innocent person, as if he had been guilty of their sin. Now he <em>spared </em>them in this respect, that if he had come he would have been constrained to reprove them more severely, while he wished rather that they should of their own accord repent previously to his arrival, that there might be no occasion for a harsher remedy, <span class="cite-ref">(303)</span> which is a signal evidence of more than paternal lenity. For how much forbearance there was in shunning this necessity, when he had just ground of provocation! </p><p>He makes use, also, of an oath, that he may not seem to have contrived something to serve a particular purpose. For the matter in itself was of no small importance, and it was of great consequence that he should be entirely free from all suspicion of falsehood and pretence. Now there are two things that make an oath lawful and pious — the occasion and the disposition. The <em>occasion </em>I refer to is, where an oath is not employed rashly, that is, in mere trifles, or even in matters of small importance, but only where there is a call for it. The <em>disposition </em>I refer to is, where there is not so much regard had to private advantage, as concern felt for the glory of God, and the advantage of the brethren: For this end must always be kept in view, that our oaths may promote the honor of God, and promote also the advantage of our neighbours in a matter that is befitting. <span class="cite-ref">(304)</span></p><p>The form of the oath must also be observed — <em>first, </em>that he calls God to witness; and, <em>secondly, </em>that he says <em>upon my soul </em>For in matters that are doubtful and obscure, where man’s knowledge fails, we have recourse to God, that he, who alone is truth, may bear testimony to the truth. But the man that appeals to God as his witness, calls upon him at the same time to be an avenger of perjury, in the event of his declaring what is false. This is what is meant by the phrase <em>upon my soul. </em>“I do not object to his inflicting punishment upon me, if I am guilty of falsehood.” Although, however, this is not always expressed in so many words, it is, notwithstanding, to be understood. For </p><p>if we are unfaithful, God remaineth faithful<LineBreak />and will not deny himself (<span class="bvs">2Ti_2:13</span>.) </p><p>He will not suffer, therefore, the profanation of his name to go unpunished. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(303)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Remede plus aspre et rigoureux</span>;” — “A harsher and more rigorous remedy.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(304)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Moyennant que ce soit en chose iuste et raisonable</span>;” — “Provided it is in a matter that is just and reasonable.” </p></div></div>
