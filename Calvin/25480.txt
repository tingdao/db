<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Fool, this night they will demand thy soul from thee. </em>The word <em>soul </em>carries an allusion. Formerly, the <em>rich man </em>addressed his <em>soul </em>as the seat of all the affections: but now, he speaks of the life itself, or the vital spirit. The words, <em>they will demand, ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἀπαιτοῦσιν</span><em>) </em>though in the plural number, are used indefinitely, and mean nothing more than that the <em>life </em>of the <em>rich man, </em>which he imagined to be in his own power, was at the disposal of another. I advert to this, because some take occasion from them to make unfounded speculations about angels. The design of Christ is simply to show that the life of men, which they imagine to be strongly protected by the fortress of their riches, is every moment <span class="cite-ref">(272)</span> taken away. The <em>rich man </em>is thus convicted of folly, in not knowing that his life depended on another. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(272)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que d’heure en heure la vie est ostee aux hommes</span>;” — “that from hour to hour the life of man is taken away.” </p></div></div>
