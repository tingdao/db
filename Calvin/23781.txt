<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>Thou shalt not murder </em>It is surprising that, though Christ intended to show that we are bound to obey the whole law, he should mention the second table only; but he did so, because from the duties of charity the disposition of every man is better ascertained. Piety towards God holds, no doubt, a higher rank; <span class="cite-ref">(623)</span> but as the observation of the first table is often feigned by hypocrites, the second table is better adapted for making a scrutiny. <span class="cite-ref">(624)</span> Let us know, therefore, that Christ selected those commandments in which is contained a proof of true righteousness; but by a <em>synecdoche </em>he takes a part for the whole. As to the circumstance of his placing that commandment last which speaks of <em>honoring </em>parents, it is of no consequence, for he paid no attention to the regular order. Yet it is worthy of notice, that this commandment is declared to belong to the second table, that no one may be led astray by the error of Josephus, who thought that it belonged to the first table. <span class="cite-ref">(625)</span> What is added at the end, <em>Thou shalt love thy neighbor, </em>contains nothing different from the former commandments, but is, general explanation of them all. </p><p><em>The young man saith to him. </em>The law must have been dead to him, when he vainly imagined that he was so righteous; for if he had not flattered himself through hypocrisy, it was an excellent advice to him to learn humility, to contemplate his spots and blemishes in the mirror of the law. But, intoxicated with foolish confidence, he fearlessly boasts that he has discharged his duty properly from his childhood. Paul acknowledges that the same thing happened to himself, that, so long as the power of <em>the law </em>was unknown to him, he believed that he <em>was alive; </em>but that, after he knew what <em>the law </em>could do, a deadly wound was inflicted on him, (<span class="bvs">Rom_7:9</span>.) So the reply of Christ, which follows, was suited to the man’s disposition. And yet Christ does not demand any thing beyond the commandments of the law, but, as the bare recital had not affected him, Christ employed other words for detecting the hidden disease of avarice. </p><p>I confess that we are nowhere commanded in the law to <em>sell all; </em>but as the design of the law is, to bring men to self-denial, and as it expressly condemns covetousness, we see that Christ had no other object in view than to correct the false conviction of the <em>young man</em>. <span class="cite-ref">(626)</span> for if he had known himself thoroughly, as soon as he heard the mention of <em>the law</em>, he would have acknowledged that he was liable to the judgment of God; but now, when the bare words of the law do not sufficiently convince him of his guilt, the inward meaning is expressed by other words. If Christ now demanded any thing beyond the commandments of the law, he would be at variance with himself. He just now taught that perfect righteousness is comprehended in <em>the commandments </em>of the law: how then will it agree with this to charge the law with deficiency? Besides, the protestation of Moses, (<span class="bvs">Deu_30:15</span>,) which I formerly quoted, would be false. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(623)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vray est qu’entre les commandemens ceux qui parlent de la recognoissance que nous devons a Dieu tienent le premier degre</span>;” — “it is true that, among the commandments, those which speak of the acknowledgment which we owe to God hold the first rank.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(624)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A faire examen pour cognoistre les personnes</span>;” — “to make a scrutiny for knowing persons.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(625)</span> Josephus says that there were <em>five on each table</em>, from which it must be inferred, that he considered the Fifth commandment as belonging to the First Table. His words are: <em>He showed them the two tables</em>, <em>with the ten commandments engraven upon them</em>, <em>Five upon each table</em>; <em>and the writin was b </em>y<em>the hand of God</em>. — <em>(Ant</em>. 3. 6, <em>8</em>. <em>) </em>— <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(626)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La fausse persuasion et presomption de ee ieune homme</span>;” — “the false conviction and presumption of this young man.” </p></div></div>
