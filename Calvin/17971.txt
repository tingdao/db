<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Send ye a lamb. </em>Here the Prophet scoffs at the Moabites for not acknowledging God at the proper time, but recklessly waiting for the stroke of his hand, till they were completely destroyed. It is, therefore, a condemnation of late repentance, when men cannot be brought to obedience by any warnings, and continue in obstinate opposition to God. Where the disease is incurable, an exhortation of this kind is appropriate; and this ought to be carefully observed, for both Jews and Christians misinterpret this passage. </p><p>Jerome explains it as referring to Christ, because he drew his birth from the Moabites, (<span class="bvs">Rut_1:4</span>; <span class="bvs">Mat_1:5</span>,) from whom Ruth was descended; and that opinion has been adopted by almost all Christians; as if the Prophet had said, “O Lord, though a judgment so severe as this awaits the Moabites, still thou wilt not utterly destroy them; for they will send thee <em>a Lamb, the ruler of the world.” </em>But that interpretation, being destitute of plausibility, need not be refuted. </p><p>On the other hand, the Jews think that these words were spoken because, while the Jews were in a depressed condition, the Moabites ceased to pay the tribute which they owed them, but that, after having prophesied about the restoration of the kingdom of Judah, Isaiah likewise added an exhortation to remind them to acknowledge their king. They even go so far as to say that it serves the purpose of a royal edict, taking them to task for their disloyalty, “Send the tribute which you owe.” But we nowhere read that the Moabites were subjects or tributaries to the Jews, and there is no probability in the conjecture. Nor does the passage which they quote (<span class="bvs">2Kg_3:5</span>) give them any support; for that passage relates to <em>the king of Israel</em>, and expressly mentions <em>Ahab </em>and <em>Samaria</em>, who cherished, as we are aware, the utmost hatred against the Jews. </p><p>I therefore adhere to the interpretation which I first noticed, as the true and natural interpretation; for the design of the Prophet is to condemn the Moabites for not having repented in due season, and to tell them that they will now in vain do what they might easily have done formerly, and with great advantage to themselves. We ought, therefore, to view it as spoken ironically, (<span class="lang el-gr">εἰρωνικῶς</span>,) <em>Send</em>; as if he had said that there is no hope of pardon, that they will <em>send </em>in vain. When the wicked are warned, they indolently disregard all exhortation; when they are punished, they gaze around them with distressful looks, seeking assistance in every direction, and trying every method of relief, but unsuccessfully, for they gain no advantage. Isaiah, therefore, reproaches them for obstinacy and rebellion, and shows that there will be no time for repentance, when they meet with the destruction which they deserve. </p><p><em>To the ruler of the world. </em>The opinion of the Jews, that this denotes Hezekiah, is at variance with all reason; for <span class="lang he-il">ארץ</span> (<em>eretz</em>) does not here denote a particular country, but rather the whole <em>world</em>, of which he speaks in general terms. The appellation <em>Ruler </em>must therefore be viewed as referring to God himself. By <em>a lamb</em>, he means what was to be offered in sacrifice; for even the Gentiles acknowledged that they worshipped God when they offered sacrifices. </p><p><em>From the rock </em><span class="cite-ref">(249)</span><em>of the desert. </em>He gives the name of <em>the rock of the desert </em>to the city, which is supposed to have been the chief city of the Moabites; <span class="cite-ref">(250)</span> though it is possible that he intended to include the whole of the country, and thus a part will be taken for the whole. </p><p><em>To the mountain of the daughter of Zion; </em>that is, to God’s authorized temple, in which sacrifices were offered according to the injunction of the Law. (<span class="bvs">Deu_12:5</span>; <span class="bvs">2Ch_7:12</span>.) This is a remarkable passage against obstinate men, who set aside all instruction, and fearlessly despise God, till they are visited by his judgments. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(249)</span><em>From Sela</em>, (or, <em>Petra</em>.) — Eng.
