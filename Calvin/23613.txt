<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>When the evening was drawing on. </em>The disciples had now lost their object, and they see that Christ is again absorbed in teaching, while the multitudes are so eager to receive instruction that they do not think of retiring. Theytherefore advise that for the sake of attending to their bodily wants, Christ should <em>send them away into the neighboring villages. </em>He had purposely delayed till now the miracle which he intended to perform; first, that his disciples might consider it more attentively, and might thus derive from it greater advantage; and next, that the very circumstance of the time might convince them that, though he does not prevent, and even does not immediately supply, the wants of his people, yet he never ceases to care for them, but has always at hand the assistance which he affords at the very time when it is required. </p></div>
