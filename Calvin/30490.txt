In the meantime we are not destitute of necessary helps. Hence Peter obviates a doubt by these words, “The Lord will abundantly supply your need, until you shall enter into his eternal kingdom.” He calls it the <em>kingdom of Christ, </em>because we cannot ascend to heaven except under his banner and guidance. </p></div>
