<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>As the Father hath loved me. </em>He intended to express something far greater than is commonly supposed; for they who think that he now speaks of the sacred <em>love </em>of God the Father, which he always had towards the Son, philosophize away from the subject; for it was rather the design of Christ to lay, as it were, in our bosom a sure pledge of God’s <em>love </em>towards us. That abstruse inquiry, as to the manner in which the Father always <em>loved </em>himself in the Son, has nothing to do with the present passage. But the<em>love </em>which is here mentioned must be understood as referring to us, because Christ testifies that <em>the Father loves </em>him, as he is the Head of the Church. And this is highly necessary for us; for he who without a Mediator, inquires how he is <em>loved </em>by God, involves him in a labyrinth, in which he will neither discover the entrance, nor the means of extricating himself. We ought therefore to cast our eyes on Christ, in whom will be found the testimony and pledge of the love of God; for the love of God was fully poured out on him, that from him it might flow to his members. He is distinguished by this title, that he is <em>the beloved Son</em>, in whom the will of the Father is satisfied, (<span class="bvs">Mat_3:17</span>.) But we ought to observe the end, which is, that God may accept us in him. So, then, we may contemplate in him, as in a mirror, God’s paternal love towards us all; because he is not <em>loved </em>apart, or for his own private advantage, but that he may unite us with him to the Father. </p><p><em>Abide in my love. </em>Some explain this to mean, that Christ demands from his disciples mutual <em>love; </em>but others explain it better, who understand it to mean the <em>love </em>of Christ towards us. He means that we should continually enjoy that love with which he once loved us, and, therefore, that we ought to take care not to deprive ourselves of it; for many reject the grace which is offered to them, and many throw away what they once had in their hands. So, then, since we have been once received into the grace of Christ, we must see that we do not fall from it through our own fault. </p><p>The conclusion which some draw from these words, that there is no efficacy in the grace of God. unless it be aided by our steadfastness, is frivolous. For I do not admit that the Spirit demands from us no more than what is in our own power, but he shows us what we ought to do, that, if our strength be deficient, we may seek it from some other quarter. In like manner, when Christ exhorts us, in this passage, to perseverance, we must; not rely on our own strength and industry, but we ought to pray to him who commands us, that he would confirm us in his love. </p></div>
