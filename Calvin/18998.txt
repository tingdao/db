<div class="comment-content"><p>God here confirms what is said in the last verse, and would make his people ashamed, because they valued him less than girls are wont to value their ornaments. The necklaces of young women are indeed nothing but mere trifles, and yet we see that girls are so taken with them through a foolish passion, that they value such trinkets more than their very life. “How then is it, “says God, “that <em>my people have forgotten me? </em>Is there to be found any such ornament? Can anything be found among the most valuable jewels and the most precious stones which can be compared with me?” </p><p>God shews by this comparison how perverted the minds of the Jews were, when they renounced and rejected a benefit so invaluable as to have God as their Father, and to be prosperous under his dominion; for nothing necessary for a blessed life had been wanting to them as long as they continued the recipients of that paternal favor, which God had manifested towards them, and wished to shew to them to the end. As then they had found God to have been so bountiful, must they not have been more than mad, when they willfully rejected his favor? while yet young women commonly set their thoughts and affections strongly and permanently on such trifles as are of no value. <span class="cite-ref">(64)</span> But the Prophet designedly used this similitude, that he might introduce what is contained in the next verse: his object was to compare the Jews to adulterous women, who being led away by unbridled lust, follow wanton lovers. As then he intended to bring this charge against the Jews, he spoke expressly of the ornaments of young women; and hence it follows — </p><p><strong>(64)</strong> The second word, <span class="lang he-il">כלה</span>, is rendered “sponsa — a bride,” in our version, <em>by Calvin </em>and <em>Blayney, </em>and so by the <em>Vulgate, Syriac, </em>and the <em>Targum, </em>but by the <em>Septuagint, </em>“<span class="lang el-gr">παρθένος</span> — a virgin:” and <em>Parkhurst </em>says that it never means a bride. The version then ought to be, — </p><p>Can a maid forget her ornaments, <LineBreak />A virgin her bands? </p><p>That the word <span class="lang he-il">קשרים</span> means bands of some kind is evident, as the verb signifies to bind, to join closely. Bands or bandage for the breast — <span class="lang el-gr">στηθοδεσμίδα</span>, is the version of the <em>Septuagint; </em>the <em>Arabic </em>and the <em>Vulgate </em>are the same. <em>Parkhurst </em>considers that “head-bands” are meant. The word is found also in <span class="bvs">Isa_3:20</span>; where the <em>Septuagint </em>render it “<span class="lang el-gr">δακτυλίοις</span> -rings,” and the <em>Targum, “ </em>murenulas — chains,” which were of gold, and worn around the neck. For any practical purpose it is only necessary to know that they were embellishments which young women delighted in: and women in every age are too fond of such things, and men too; but the case is introduced here only for the sake of illustration. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
