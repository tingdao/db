<div class="comment-content"><p>He confirms what I have already stated—that though other enemies, the Assyrians or Chaldeans, attacked the Jews, yet God would be the principal leader of the war. God then claims here for himself what the Jews transferred to their earthly enemies: and the Prophet has already often called it the day of Jehovah; for God would then make known his power, which had been a sport to them. He therefore declares in this place, that he would <em>reduce man to distress</em>, so that the whole nation would <em>walk like the blind </em>—that, being void of counsel, they would stumble and fall, and not be able to proceed in their course: for they are said to go astray like the blind, who see no end to their evils, who find no means to escape ruin, but are held as it were fast bound. And we must ever bear in mind what I have already said—that the Jews were inflated with such pride, that they heedlessly despised all the Prophets. Since then they were thus wise in themselves, God denounces blindness on them. </p><p>He subjoins the reason, <em>Because they had acted impiously towards Jehovah </em><span class="cite-ref">(86)</span> By these words he confirms what I have already explained—that the intermediate causes are not to be considered, though the Chaldeans took vengeance on the Jews; for there is a higher principle, and another cause of this evil, even the contempt of God and of his celestial truth; for they had acted impiously towards God. And by these words the Prophet reminds the Jews, that no alleviation was to be expected, as they had not only men hostile to them, but God himself, whom they had extremely provoked. </p><p>Hence he adds, <em>Poured forth shall be your blood as dust </em><span class="cite-ref">(87)</span> They whom God delivered up to extreme reproach were deserving of this, because he had been despised by them. <em>Their flesh</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(88)</span> he says, <em>shall be as dung</em>. Now, we know how much the Jews boasted of their preeminence; and God had certainly given them occasion to boast, had they made a right and legitimate use of his benefits; but as they had despised him, they deserved in their turn to be exposed to every ignominy and reproach. Hence the Prophet here lays prostrate all their false boastings by which they were inflated; for they wished to be honorable, while God was despised by them. At last he adds— </p><p><strong>(86)</strong> The Hebrew words are literally, </p><p>For against Jehovah have they sinned. </p><p>—<em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(87)</strong> “Copiously and in contempt,” says <em>Marckius</em>; “as a thing of no value,” says <em>Grotius</em>; “as worthless as dust,” says <em>Drusius</em>. The comparison is evidently intended to show that their blood, or their life, would be treated with contempt, and no more regarded than dust.—<em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(88)</strong> The word is [<span class="lang he-il">לחט</span> ], usually rendered food; here it means what is fed, the carcass, the body. It is rendered “flesh” by the Septuagint.—<em>Ed. </em></p></div>
