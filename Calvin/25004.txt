<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>For my eyes have seen </em>This mode of expression is very common in Scripture; but Simeon appears to denote expressly the bodily appearance of Christ, as if he had said, that he now has the Son of God present in the flesh, on whom the <em>eyes </em>of his mind had been previously fixed. By <em>saving </em><span class="cite-ref">(197)</span> I understand the matter of salvation: for in Christ are hid all the parts of salvation and of a happy life. Now if the sight of Christ, while he was yet a child, had so powerful an effect on Simeon, that he approached death with cheerfulness and composure; how much more abundant materials of lasting peace are now furnished to us, who have the opportunity of beholding our salvation altogether completed in Christ? True, Christ no longer dwells on earth, nor do we carry him in our arms: but his divine majesty shines openly and brightly in the gospel, and there do “we all,” as Paul says, “behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord,” — not as formerly amidst the weakness of flesh, but in the glorious power of the Spirit, which he displayed in his miracles, in the sacrifice of his death, and in his resurrection. In a word, his absence from us in body is of such a nature, that we are permitted to behold him sitting at the right hand of the Father. If such a sight does not bring peace to our minds, and make us go cheerfully to death, we are highly ungrateful to God, and hold the honor, which he has bestowed upon us, in little estimation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(197)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La ou nous avons rendu </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Ton salut, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">qui voudroit suivre le mot Grec de pres, il faudroit dire, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Ton Salutaire </em><em>.” </em>—<em>“ </em>Where we have translated <em>Thy Salvation, </em>were we to follow closely the Greek word, we must say, <em>Thy Saving.” </em>—<em>It </em>is evident that Calvin viewed<span class="lang el-gr">σωτήριον, </span> not with most of our lexicographers, as a noun of the same import with<span class="lang el-gr">σωτηρία, </span><em>salvation, </em>but as the neuter of the adjective<span class="lang el-gr">σωτήριος, </span> which occurs in a memorable phrase<span class="lang el-gr">, ἡ χάρις τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡ σωτήριος, </span> (<span class="cite-note">Titus 2:11</span>,) rendered in the English version, <em>the grace of God that bringeth salvation</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
