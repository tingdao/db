<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20</strong><em>Let him know</em>. I doubt whether this ought rather to have been written, <span class="lang el-gr">γιςώσκετε</span>, “know ye.” Both ways the meaning however is the same. For James recommends to us the correction of our brethren from the effect produced that we may more assiduously attend to this duty. Nothing is better or more desirable than to deliver a soul from eternal death; and this is what he does who restores an erring brother to the right way: therefore a work so excellent ought by no means to be neglected. To give food to the hungry, and drink to the thirsty, we see how much Christ values such acts; but the salvation of the soul is esteemed by him much more precious than the life of the body. We must therefore take heed lest souls perish through our sloth, whose salvation God puts in a manner in our hands. Not that we can bestow salvation on them; but that God by our ministry delivers and saves those who seem otherwise to be nigh destruction. </p><p>Some copies have <em>his soul</em>, which makes no change in the sense. I, however, prefer the other reading, for it has more force in it. </p><p><em>And shall hide a multitude of sins</em>. He makes an allusion to a saying of Solomon, rather than a quotation. (<span class="bvs">Pro_10:12</span>.) Solomon says that love covers sins, as hatred proclaims them. For they who hate burn with the desire of mutual slander; but they who love are disposed to exercise mutual forbearance. Love, then, buries sins as to men. James teaches here something higher, that is, that sins are blotted out before God; as though he had said, Solomon has declared this as the fruit of love, that it covers sins; but there is no better or more excellent way of covering them than when they are wholly abolished before God. And this is done when the sinner is brought by our admonition to the right way: we ought then especially and more carefully to attend to this duty. </p><p>END OF THE EPISTLE OF JAMES </p></div>
