<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_8:5</span><strong>.</strong><em>And when Jesus had entered </em>Those who think that Matthew and Luke give different narratives, are led into a mistake by a mere trifle. The only difference in the words is, that Matthew says that <em>the centurion came to him, </em>while Luke says that he sent some of the Jews to plead in his name. But there is no impropriety in Matthew saying, that the centurion did what was done in his name and at his request. There is such a perfect agreement between the two Evangelists in all the circumstances, that it is absurd to make two miracles instead of one. </p><p>The band of soldiers, which the centurion had under his command, was stationed, I have no doubt, in the town of Capernaum, in the same manner as garrisons were usually appointed for the protection of the towns. Though he perceived the morals of the people to be very vicious and depraved, (for we know that Capernaum, being on the seacoast, must have been more dissolute <span class="cite-ref">(499)</span> than other towns,) yet this did not prevent him from condemning the superstitions of his country, and acquiring a taste for true and sincere piety. He had not built a synagogue for the Jews without exposing himself to some hatred and to some risk: and the only reason why <em>he loved that nation </em>was, that he had embraced the worship of one God. Before Christ healed his servant, he had been healed by the Lord. </p><p>This was itself a miracle. One who belonged to the military profession, and who had crossed the sea with a band of soldiers, for the purpose of accustoming the Jews to endure the yoke of Roman tyranny, submits willingly, and yields obedience to the God of Israel. Luke says that this <em>servant was very dear to him; </em>and thus anticipates a doubt which might have arisen in the mind of the reader: for we know that slaves <span class="cite-ref">(500)</span> were not held in such estimation, as to make their masters so solicitous about their life, unless by extraordinary industry, or fidelity, or some other virtue, they had secured their favor. By this statement Luke means, that this was not a low or ordinary slave, but a faithful servant, distinguished by many excellencies, and very highly esteemed by his master; and that this was the reason why he was so anxious about his life, and recommended him so earnestly. From both Evangelists it is evident that it was a sudden palsy, which, from the first attack, took away all hope of life: for slow palsies are not attended by severe pain. Matthew says, that he was <em>grievously tormented, </em>and Luke, that he was <em>near death </em>Both descriptions — pain or agony, and extreme danger — serve to enhance the glory of the miracle: and for this reason I am the more unwilling to hazard any absolute assertion as to the nature of the disease. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(499)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Plus pleines de dissolutions et de desbauches</span>;” — “more full of dissoluteness and debauchery.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(500)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu'on ne tenoit pas si grande conte de serfs</span>;” — “that they did not set so great value on slaves.” </p></div></div>
