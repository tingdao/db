<div class="comment-content"><p>Now, with regard to the writing itself, God could not be a free agent unless he possessed the power of addressing one man at one time, and a number of men at another. He wished King Belshazzar to be conscious of this writing, while the magi were all as unable to read it as if they were blind. And then, with reference to the interpretation, their perplexity need not surprise us. For God spoke enigmatically, when he said Mene, Mene, and then Tekel, that is <em>weighed, </em>and Peres, <em>divided. </em>If the magi could have read these words a hundred times over, they could never either <em>conjecture </em>or comprehend their true meaning. The prophecy was allegorical, until an interpreter was divinely ordained for it. So far as the mere letters are concerned, there is no reason why we should be surprised at the eyes of the magi being blinded, since God pleased it to be so, and wished to <em>cite </em>the king to his tribunal, as we have already said. The Prophet says, <em>The king was frightened, his countenance was changed, and the princes also were disturbed </em>The publicity of the event ought to have increased the sense of God’s judgment, for, as we shall afterwards see, King Belshazzar himself was slain that very night. Cyrus entered while the Babylonians were feasting, and enjoying their luxuries in security. So remarkable an example of God’s justice might have been instantly buried in that drunken revel, had it not been rendered conspicuous to many bystanders. Hence Daniel repeats, <em>The king was disturbed, </em>after he saw no prospect of either aid or advice from his magi and astrologers. He says also, <em>his princes were astonished, </em>because not only the king ought to be troubled but the whole Court, and the report ought to flow forth not only through the city, but to foreign nations, since there is no doubt that Cyrus was afterwards informed of this prophecy; for he would not have courted Daniel so much, nor honored him so remarkably, unless this <em>occurrence </em>had been made known to him. It afterwards follows: </p></div>
