<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Who has known the mind of the Lord? </em>He begins here to extend as it were his hand to restrain the audacity of men, lest they should clamor against God’s judgments, and this he does by stating two reasons: the first is, that all mortals are too blind to take a view of God’s predestination by their own understanding, and to reason on a thing unknown is presumptuous and absurd; the other is, that we can have no cause of complaint against God, since no mortal can boast that God is a debtor to him; but that, on the contrary, all are under obligations to him for his bounty. <span class="cite-ref">(375)</span></p><p>Within this limit then let every one remember to keep his own mind, lest he be carried beyond God’s oracles in investigating predestination, since we hear that man can distinguish nothing in this case, any more than a blind man in darkness. This caution, however, is not to be so applied as to weaken the certainty of faith, which proceeds not from the acumen of the human mind, but solely from the illumination of the Spirit; for Paul himself in another place, after having testified that all the mysteries of God far exceed the comprehension of our minds, immediately subjoins that the faithful understand the mind of the Lord, because they have not received the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which has been given them by God, by whom they are instructed as to his goodness, which otherwise would be incomprehensible to them. </p><p>As then we cannot by our own faculties examine the secrets of God, so we are admitted into a certain and clear knowledge of them by the grace of the Holy Spirit: and if we ought to follow the guidance of the Spirit, where he leaves us, there we ought to stop and as it were to fix our standing. If any one will seek to know more than what God has revealed, he shall be overwhelmed with the immeasurable brightness of inaccessible light. But we must bear in mind the distinction, which I have before mentioned, between the secret counsel of God, and his will made known in Scripture; for though the whole doctrine of Scripture surpasses in its height the mind of man, yet an access to it is not closed against the faithful, who reverently and soberly follow the Spirit as their guide; but the case is different with regard to his hidden counsel, the depth and height of which cannot by any investigation be reached. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(375)</span> The words of this verse seem to have been taken literally from <span class="bvs">Isa_40:13</span>, as given in the <em>Septuagint</em>. The Hebrew is in some measure different, but the words will admit of a rendering approaching nearer to the meaning here than what is presented in our version, as follows — </p><p>Who has weighed the spirit of Jehovah,<span class="cite-ref"><LineBreak /></span>And, <em>being </em>a man of his counsel, has taught him? </p><p>To “weigh the spirit” is to know it thoroughly: the same verb, <span class="lang he-il">תכן</span>, is used in this sense in <span class="bvs">Pro_16:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Pro_24:12</span>. It indeed means to compute by measure or by weight; so that it may be rendered “measure” as well as “weigh,” and if we adopt “measure,” it will then appear that to “know the mind of the Lord,” is to know the <em>extent </em>of his understanding or knowledge; an idea which remarkably corresponds with the passage. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
