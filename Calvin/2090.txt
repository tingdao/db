<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>He that smiteth a man</em>, <em>so that he die</em>. This passage, as I have said, more clearly explains the details, and first makes a distinction between voluntary and accidental homicide; for, if a stone or an axe (<span class="bvs">Deu_19:5</span>.) may have slipped from a man unintentionally, and struck anybody, He would not have it accounted a capital crime. And for this purpose the cities of refuge were given, of which brief mention is here made, and whose rights will be presently more fully spoken of, and where also the mode of distinguishing between design and ignorance will be laid down. But it must be remarked, that Moses declares that accidental homicide, as it is commonly called, does not happen by chance or accident, but according to the will of God, as if He himself led out the person, who is killed, to death. By whatever kind of death, therefore, men are taken away, it is certain that we live or die only at His pleasure; and surely, if not even a sparrow can fall to the ground <em>except </em>by His will, (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:29</span>,) it would be very absurd that men created in His image should be abandoned to the blind impulses of fortune. Wherefore it must be concluded, as Scripture elsewhere teaches, that the term of each man’s life is appointed, <span class="cite-ref">(29)</span> with which another passage corresponds, </p><p>“Thou turnest man to destruction, and savest,<LineBreak />Return, ye children of men.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_90:3</span>.) </p><p>It is true, indeed, that whatever has no apparent cause or necessity seems to us to be fortuitous; and thus, whatever, according to nature, might happen otherwise we call <em>accidents</em>, (<em>contingentia</em>;) yet in the meantime it must be remembered, that what might else incline either way is governed by God’s secret counsel, so that nothing is done without His arrangement and decree. In this way we do not suppose a fate <span class="cite-ref">(30)</span> such as the Stoics invented; for it is a different tiling to say that things which of themselves incline to various and doubtful events, are directed by the hand of God whithersoever He will, and to say that necessity governs them in accordance with the perpetual complication of causes, <span class="cite-ref">(31)</span> and that this happens with God’s connivance; nay, nothing can be more opposite than that God should be drawn and carried away by a fatal motive power, or that He tempers all things as He sees fit. </p><p>There is no reason to follow the Jews here in philosophizing more deeply, that none are delivered to death but those in whom God finds cause for it. It is indeed certain, that with God there always exists the best reason for His acts; but it is wrong to elicit from thence that those who by tits guidance meet with death must be guilty of some offense. Nor even if God should take away an innocent man, would it bc lawful to murmur against Him; as if His justice were naught, because it is concealed from us, and indeed incomprehensible. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(29)</span> No reference is here given, but it is probably to <span class="bvs">Job_14:5</span>, — “Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(30)</span> “Une necessite fatale.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(31)</span> “Une necessite confuse selon des causes entortillees;” a confused necessity according to complicated causes. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
