<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Lo! this is the man that made not God his strength </em>Some think that these words are given as what should afterwards be proverbially applied to Doeg; but they would not appear to have been intended in that restricted signification. They merely express the improvement which the people of God would make of the judgment. It would teach them, on the one hand, to be patient under the insolence of the ungodly, which is so speedily humbled; and, on the other, to beware of indulging a similarly infatuated spirit themselves. They would laugh at their destruction, yet not in the way of insulting over them, but rejoicing more and more in the confidence of the help of God, and denying themselves more cheerfully to the vain pleasures of this world. This is the lesson to be learned from such dispensations of providence: they should recall our wandering affections to God. The verse is introduced with an exclamation, <em>Lo! this is the man, </em>etc.; for David would have us to look upon this one instance as representing to our eyes, in a vivid manner, the end of all who despise the Lord; and it may be remarked, that it is no small point of practical wisdom thus to generalise individual providences. The two clauses, <em>made not God his strength, </em>and, <em>trusted in the abundance of his riches, </em>stand mutually connected; for none can be said sincerely to repose upon God but he who has been emptied of all confidence in his own resources. So long as men imagine that they have something of their own in which they can boast, they will never resort to God: just in proportion as we arrogate to ourselves do we derogate from him; and it is not only wealth, but any other earthly possession, which, by engrossing our confidence, may prevent us from inquiring after the Lord. The noun <span class="lang he-il">הוה</span>, <em>havah, </em>which most interpreters have rendered <em>wickedness, </em><span class="cite-ref">(281)</span> and some <em>slaughter </em>or <em>destruction, </em>seems, in this place, rather to mean <em>substance. </em><span class="cite-ref">(282)</span> Such repetitions of the same sentiment in different words are common with the Psalmist; and, according to this translation, the verse will flow connectedly, reading, that the man who trusts in his riches, and strengthens himself in his substance, defrauds God of his just glory. </p><p><strong>(281)</strong> If this is the true rendering, there may be a reference to the expectations which Doeg had entertained of increasing his power and influence by maliciously injuring David, as he would thereby obtain, in a high degree, the favor of Saul. </p><p><strong>(282)</strong> This is the marginal reading in our English Bible. As he was Saul’s chief herdsman, it is probable that his riches consisted chiefly in cattle. </p></div>
