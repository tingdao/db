<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>And hath given him power. </em>He again repeats that the Father hath given him dominion, that he may have full power over all things in heaven and in the earth. The word (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐξουσία</span>) here denotes <em>authority Judgment </em>is here put for rule and government, as if he had said, that the Father had appointed him to be King, to govern the world, and exercise the power of the Father himself. </p><p><em>Because he is the Son of man. </em>This reason, which is immediately added, deserves particularly to be observed, for it means that he comes forth to men, adorned with such magnificence of power, that he may impart to them what he has received from the Father. Some think that this passage contains nothing else than what is said by Paul, that Christ, </p><p>having been in the form of God emptied himself by taking upon him the form of a servant, and humbled himself even to the death of the cross; and therefore God hath exalted him, and given him a name more illustrious than any name, that every knee may bow before him <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Phi_2:7</span>.) </p><p>But for my own part, I regard the meaning as more extensive: that Christ, so far as he is man, was appointed by the Father to be the Author of life, that it may not be necessary for us to go far to seek it; for Christ did not receive it for himself, as if he needed it, but in order to enrich us by his wealth. It may be summed up thus: “What had been hidden in God is revealed to us in Christ as man, and <em>life</em>, which was formerly inaccessible, is now placed before our eyes.” There are some who separate this argument from its immediate connection, and join it to the following clause; but this is a forced interpretation, and is at variance with Christ’s meaning. </p></div>
