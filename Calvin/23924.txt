<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And all their works they do that they may be seen by men. </em>He had lately said that the <em>scribes </em>live very differently from what they teach; but now he adds that, if they have any thing which is apparently good, it is hypocritical and worthless, because they have no other design than to please men, and to vaunt themselves. And here zeal for piety and a holy life is contrasted with the mask of those <em>works </em>which serve no purpose but for ostentation; for an upright worshipper of God will never give himself up to that empty parade by which hypocrites are puffed up. Thus not only is the ambition of <em>the scribes and Pharisees </em>reproved, but our Lord, after having condemned the transgression and contempt of the Law of God in their whole life, that they might not shield themselves by their pretended holiness, anticipates them by replying, that those things of which they boast are absolute trifles, and of no value whatever, because they spring from mere ostentation. He afterwards produces a single instance, by which that ambition was easily perceived, which was, that by the <em>fringes of their robes </em>they held themselves out to the eyes of men as good observers of the Law. </p><p><em>And make their phylacteries broad, and enlarge the fringes of their robes. </em>For why were their <em>fringes </em>made <em>broader, </em>and their <em>phylacteries </em>more <em>magnificent</em>, than what was customary, except for idle display? The Lord had commanded the Jews to wear, both on their forehead and on their raiment, some remarkable passages selected out of the Law, (<span class="bvs">Deu_6:8</span>.) As forgetfulness of the Law easily creeps upon the flesh, the Lord intended in this manner to keep it constantly in the remembrance of his people; for they were likewise enjoined to inscribe such sentences </p><p>on the posts of their houses, (<span class="bvs">Deu_6:9</span>,) </p><p>that, wherever they turned their eyes, some godly warning might immediately meet them. But what did <em>the scribes </em>do? In order to distinguish themselves from the rest of the people, they carried about with them the commandments of God more magnificently inscribed on their garments; and in this boasting there was displayed an offensive ambition. </p><p>Let us also learn from this, how ingenious men are in mixing up vain deception, in order to conceal their vices under some pretext and cloak of virtues, by turning to the purposes of their own hypocrisy those exercises of piety which God has enjoined. Nothing was more profitable than to exercise all their senses in the contemplation of the Law, and it was not without good reason that this was enjoined by the Lord. But so far were they from profiting by these simple instructions, that, by making perfect righteousness to consist in the adorning of robes, they despised the Law throughout their whole life. For it was impossible to treat the Law of God with greater contempt, than when they imagined that they kept it by pompous dress, or pronounced masks contrived for enacting a play to be a keeping of the Law. </p><p>What Mark and Luke say about the <em>robes </em>relates to the same subject. We know that the inhabitants of Eastern countries commonly used long <em>robes</em>, â€” a custom which they retain to this day. But it is evident from Zechariah (<span class="bvs">Zec_13:4</span>) that the prophets were distinguished from the rest of the people by a particular form of a cloak. And, indeed, it was highly reasonable that the teachers should dress in this manner, that there might be a higher degree of gravity and modesty in their dress than in that of the common people; but the <em>scribes </em>had made an improper use of it by turning it into luxury and display. Their example has been followed by the Popish priests, among whom <em>robes </em>are manifestly nothing more than the badges of proud tyranny. </p></div>
