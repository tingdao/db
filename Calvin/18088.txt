<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>For there is not any longer a girdle. </em><span class="cite-ref">(110)</span><span class="lang he-il">מזח</span> (<em>mēzăch</em>) is translated by some <em>a girdle</em>, and by others <em>strength</em>. Those who translate it <em>girdle</em>, suppose the meaning to be that Tyre will be so completely plundered, that she will not even have a <em>girdle </em>left; and that the allusion is to the vast wealth laid out in merchandise, for the poorest of the merchants sell girdles. But I think that Isaiah alludes to the situation of the city, which was protected on all sides by ditches, mounds, ramparts, and the sea. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(110)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
