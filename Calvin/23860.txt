<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_21:33</span><strong>.</strong><em>Hear another parable. </em>The words of Luke are somewhat different; for he says that Christ <em>spoke to the people, </em>while here the discourse is addressed to the priests and scribes. But the solution is easy; for, though Christ <em>spoke against them, </em>he exposed their baseness in the presence of all the people. Mark says that Christ <em>began to speak by parables, </em>but leaves out what was first in order, as also in other passages he gives only a part of the whole. The substance of this parable is, that it is no new thing, if the priests and the other rulers of the Church wickedly endeavor to defraud God of his right; for long ago they practiced the same kind of robbery towards the prophets, and now they are ready to <em>slay his Son; </em>but they will not go unpunished, for God will arise to defend his right. The object is two-fold; first, to reproach the priests with base and wicked ingratitude; and, secondly, to remove the offense which would be occasioned by his approaching death. For, by means of a false title, they had gained such influence over simple persons and the ignorant multitude, that the religion of the Jews depended on their will and decision. Christ therefore forewarns the weak, and shows that, as so many prophets, one after another, had formerly been slain by the priests, no one ought to be distressed, if a similar instance were exhibited in his own person. But let us now examine it in detail. </p><p><em>A man planted a vineyard. </em>This comparison frequently occurs in Scripture. With respect to the present passage, Christ only means that, while God appoints pastors over his Church, he does <em>not </em>convey his right to others, but acts in the same manner as if a <em>proprietor </em>were to <em>let a vineyard </em>or <em>field </em>to a <em>husbandman, </em>who would labor in the cultivation of it, and make an annual return. As he complains by Isaiah (<span class="bvs">Isa_5:4</span>) and Jeremiah, (<span class="bvs">Jer_2:21</span>,) that he had received no fruit from the <em>vine </em>on the cultivation of which he had bestowed so much labor and expense; so in this passage he accuses the vine-dressers themselves, who, like base swindlers, appropriate to themselves the produce of the <em>vineyard. </em>Christ says that the <em>vineyard </em>was well furnished, and in excellent condition, when the <em>husbandmen </em>received it from the hands of the <em>proprietor. </em>By this statement he presents no slight aggravation of their crime; for the more generously he had acted toward them, the more detestable was their ingratitude. Paul employs the same argument, when he wishes to exhort pastors to be diligent in the discharge of their duty, that they are stewards, chosen to govern the house of God, which is the </p><p>pillar and round of truth, (<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:16</span>.) </p><p>And properly; for the more honorable and illustrious their condition is, they lie under so much the deeper obligations to God, not to be indolent in their work. So much the more detestable (as we have already said) is the baseness of those who pour contempt on the great kindness of God, and on the great honor which they have already received from Him. </p><p>God <em>planted a vineyard, </em><span class="cite-ref">(43)</span> when, remembering his gratuitous adoption, he brought the people out of Egypt, separated them anew to be his inheritance, and called them to the hope of eternal salvation, promising to be their God and Father; for this is the <em>planting </em>of which Isaiah speaks, (<span class="bvs">Isa_60:21</span>.) By the <em>wine-press </em>and the <em>tower </em>are meant the aids which were added for strengthening the faith of the people in the doctrine of the Law, such as, sacrifices and other ritual observances; for God, like a careful and provident head of a family, has left no means untried for granting to his Church all necessary protection. </p><p><em>And let it to husbandmen. </em>God might indeed of himself, without the agency of men, preserve his Church in good order; but he takes men for his ministers, and makes use of their hands. Thus, of old, he appointed priests to be, as it were, cultivators of the <em>vineyard. </em>But the wonder is, that Christ compares the prophets to servants, who are sent, after the vintage, to demand the fruit; <span class="cite-ref">(44)</span> for we know that they too were <em>vine-dressers, </em>and that they held a charge in common with the priests. I reply, it was not necessary for Christ to be careful or exact in describing the resemblance or contrariety between those two orders. The priests were certainly appointed at first on the condition of thoroughly cultivating the Church by sound doctrine; but as they neglected the work assigned them, either through carelessness or ignorance, the prophets were sent as an extraordinary supply, to clear the vine from weeds, to lop off the superfluous wood, and in other ways to make up for the neglect of the priests; and, at the same time, severely to reprove the people, to raise up decayed piety, to awaken drowsy souls, and to bring back the worship of God and a new life. And what else was this than to demand the revenue which was due to God from his vineyard? All this Christ applies justly and truly to his purpose; for the regular and permanent government of his Church was not in the hands of the prophets, but was always held by the priests; just as if lazy <em>husbandman, </em>while he neglected cultivation, claimed the place to which he had been once appointed, under the plea of possession. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(43)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Son vigne</span>;” — “His vineyard.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(44)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le fruit de la vigne</span>;” — “the fruit of the vine.” </p></div></div>
