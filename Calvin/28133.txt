<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And if children</em>, <em>etc. </em>By an argument, taken from what is annexed or what follows, he proves that our salvation consists in having God as our Father. It is for children that inheritance is appointed: since God then has adopted us as his children, he has at the same time ordained an inheritance for us. He then intimates what sort of inheritance it is — that it is heavenly, and therefore incorruptible and eternal, such as Christ possesses; and his possession of it takes away all uncertainty: and it is a commendation of the exellency of this inheritance, that we shall partake of it in common with the only-begotten Son of God. It is however the design of Paul, as it will presently appear more fully, highly to extol this inheritance promised to us, that we may be contented with it, and manfully despise the allurements of the world, and patiently bear whatever troubles may press on us in this life. </p><p><em>If so be that we suffer together</em>, <em>etc. </em>Various are the interpretations of this passage, but I approve of the following in preference to any other, “We are co-heirs with Christ, provided, in entering on our inheritance, we follow him in the same way in which he has gone before.” And he thus made mention of Christ, because he designed to pass over by these steps to an encouraging strain, — “God’s inheritance is ours, because we have by his grace been adopted as his children; and that it may not be doubtful, its possession as been already conferred on Christ, whose partners we are become: but Christ came to it by the cross; then we must come to it in the same manner.” <span class="cite-ref">(257)</span> Nor is that to be dreaded which some fear, that Paul thus ascribes the cause of our eternal glory to our labours; for this mode of speaking is not unusual in Scripture. He denotes the order, which the Lord follows in dispensing salvation to us, rather than the cause; for he has already sufficiently defended the gratuitous mercy of God against the merits of works. When now exhorting us to patience, he does not show whence salvation proceeds, but how God governs his people. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(257)</span> The particle<span class="lang el-gr">εἴπερ </span> is rendered the same as here by [<span class="bvs">Ambrose </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>], “si modo — if in case that;” but by [<span class="bvs">Chrysostom </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Peter Martyr </span>], in the sense of<span class="lang el-gr">ἐπειδὰν, </span> “quandoquidem — since,” “since we suffer together, in order that we may also be together glorified.” The <em>Vulgate </em>has, “si tamen — if however.” It may be suitably rendered “provided.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
