<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19</strong><em>Then shalt thou accept sacrifices of righteousness </em>In these words there is an apparent, but only an apparent, inconsistency with others which he had used in the preceding context. He had declared sacrifices to be of no value when considered in themselves, but now he acknowledges them to be acceptable to God when viewed as expressions or symbols of faith, penitence, and thanksgiving. He calls them distinctly <em>sacrifices of righteousness, </em>right, warrantable, and such as are offered in strict accordance with the commandment of God. The expression is the same employed in <span class="bvs">Psa_4:5</span>, where David uses it with a tacit condemnation of those who gloried in the mere outward form of ceremonies. We find him again exciting himself and others by his example to the exercise of gratitude, and to the expression of it openly in the solemn assembly. Besides sacrifices in general, two particular kinds of sacrifice are specified. Although some consider <span class="lang he-il">כליל</span>, <em>calil, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">עולה</span>, <em>olah, </em>to be both of one signification, others maintain with more correctness, that the first is to be understood as meaning the priest’s sacrifice, because in it the offering was consumed or burnt with fire. <span class="cite-ref">(274)</span> In the enumeration which he makes, David designs to teach us that none of all the legal rites can find acceptance with God, unless they be used with a reference to the proper end of their institution. The whole of this verse has been figuratively applied by some to the kingdom of Christ, but the interpretation is unnatural and too refined. Thanksgivings are indeed called by Hosea “the calves of the lips,” (<span class="bvs">Hos_14:2</span>;) but it seems evident that in the passage before us there are conjoined along with the frame or disposition of the heart those solemn ceremonies which constituted part of the ancient worship. </p><p><strong>(274)</strong> Ainsworth reads, “the burnt-offering and the whole oblation;” and observes, that “<em>The whole oblation</em>, <em>the calil</em>, was a kind of oblation that was wholly and every whit given up in fire unto God, and differed from the <em>ghnola</em>, or burnt-offering, which was only of beasts or birds, <span class="bvs">Lev_1:0</span>; whereas the <em>calil </em>was also of flour, called the meat-offering, but burned altogether, which the common meat-offerings were not, <span class="bvs">Lev_6:20</span>. It was also of beasts, <span class="bvs">1Sa_7:9</span>.” </p></div>
