<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet goes on with the same subject, — that the Ninevites would labor in vain, while striving anxiously and with every effort to defend themselves against their enemies. The meaning then is, “That though thou remittest no diligence, yet thou shalt lose all thy labor; for thou wilt not be able to resist the vengeance of God; and thou deceives thyself if thou thinkest that by the usual means thou canst aid thyself; for it is God who attacks thee by the Babylonians. How much soever then thou mayest accumulate of those things which are usually employed to fortify cities, all this will be useless.” <em>Draw for thyself, </em>he says, <em>waters for the siege; </em>that is, lay up provisions for thyself, as it is usually done, and have water laid up in cisterns; <em>strengthen thy fortresses, </em>that is, renew them; <em>enter into the clay </em>for the sake of treading the mortar: <em>fortify, </em>or cement, or join together; the brick-kiln (for what some think that <span class="lang he-il">חזק</span>, <em>chezek, </em>means, here is to hold, or to lay hold, is wholly foreign to the Prophet’s meaning:) to <em>fortify </em>then the <em>brick- kiln, </em>that is, the bricks which come forth from the kiln, nothing else than to construct and join them together, that there might be a solid building: for we know that buildings often fall, or are overturned, because they are not well joined together: and he refers to the mode of building which historians say was in use among the Assyrians. For as that country had no abundance of stones, they supplied the defect by bricks. We now then understand the intention of the Prophet. </p></div>
