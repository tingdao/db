<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Then Joshua called the Reubenites, </em>etc Here is related the discharge of the two tribes and half-tribe, who had followed the rest of the people, not that they might acquire anything for themselves, but that, as they had already obtained dwellings and lands without lot, they might carry on war in common with their brethren, until they also should have a quiet inheritance. Now, as they had been faithful companions and helpers to their brethren, Joshua declares that they were entitled to their discharge, and thus sends them back to their homes released and free. It is asked, however, how he can consider them to have performed their due measure of military service, while the enemy were still in possession of part of the land, of which the sole possession was to be the proper termination of the war? <span class="cite-ref">(178)</span> But if we bear in mind what I lately said, the knot will be loosed. Had the Israelites followed the invitation of God, and seconded his agency, nay, when he was stretching out his hand to them, had they not basely drawn back, <span class="cite-ref">(179)</span> the remaining part of the war would have been finished with no danger and little trouble. From their own sloth, therefore, they refused what God was ready to bestow. And thus it happened that the agreement by which the two tribes and half-tribe had bound themselves, ceased to be binding. For the only obligation they had undertaken was to accompany the ten tribes, and contend for their inheritance as strenuously as if their condition had been exactly the same. Now, when they have perseveringly performed their part as faithful allies, and the ten tribes contented with their present fortune, not only do not demand, but rather tacitly repudiate their assistance, a free return to their homes is justly allowed them. They, indeed, deserve praise for their patient endurance, in not allowing weariness of the service to make them request their discharge, but in waiting quietly till Joshua of his own accord sends for them. <span class="cite-ref">(180)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(178)</span> Latin, “Cujus sola possessio justum debuit bello imponere finem.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">De laquelle il faloit qu’ils fussent paisibles possesseurs avant qu’ils peussent avoir licence de se desparter, et avant que finir la guerre</span>;” “Of which it was necessary that they should be peaceful possessors before they could have license to depart, and before finishing the war.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(179)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ou pour mieux dire, s’ils n’eussent vilainement tourne le dos arriere, quand il leur tendoit la main</span>;” “Or, to speak more properly, if they had not villanously turned their back when he stretched out his hand to them.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(180)</span> Jewish writers, founding on plausible <em>data</em>, calculate that the auxiliary tribes who crossed the Jordan to assist their brethren, had been absent from their homes for a period of fourteen years. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
