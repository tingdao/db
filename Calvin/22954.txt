<div class="comment-content"><p>Zechariah explains here each part of the prophecy; but he shows at the same time that two of the chariots hastened towards Chaldea, that it might not be grievous to the Jews that they in the first place had to experience God’s judgment. He then shows that God sent his messengers to all parts; but that there had been, or were to be, remarkable and extraordinary changes, especially among the Babylonians. It hence appeared evident, that God had a care for his own people, who had been driven there into exile. And I leave already stated the reason why he speaks here of red horses; for they are mistaken who think that the first chariot was sent into Chaldea; for I consider that this refers to the Jews, with whom God’s judgment commenced. He then says, that two chariots went towards Babylon, the first was drawn by black horses, and the other by white, because of the kindness shown by the Persian, by whom a new light of joy was brought to the Jews. </p><p>With regard to the <em>land of the south</em>, the Prophet no doubt alludes to the Egyptians. But he afterwards adds, that the last chariot was conveyed elsewhere, even through the whole world. Some render <span class="lang he-il">אמוצים</span>, <em>amustim</em>, strong; and this is the proper meaning of the word, for <span class="lang he-il">אמץ</span>, <em>amets</em>, properly means to fortify, to strengthen; but as color is intended here, it seems probable to me that it means somewhat red, as some of the Rabbis teach us; for the Prophet mentioned another word before, <span class="lang he-il">ברדים</span>, <em>beredim</em>, grilled. Hence some interpreters join together the two, and say that the horses were grisled, or spotted like hail, and then that they were <span class="lang he-il">אמוצים</span>, <em>amutsim</em>, somewhat red. Jerome seems to me to have sufficiently refuted this opinion, because the other horses were <span class="lang he-il">אדמים</span>, <em>ademim</em>, red, but these were of different colors. And further, it can hardly be suitable to say, that these alone were strong horses who drew this chariot; for we know that God so wonderfully exercised his power against the Chaldeans that two chariots went forth to them, and they would not have been drawn by weak and feeble horses. I hence think that their color is here designated, and the Prophet calls them once grilled, and then somewhat red. </p></div>
