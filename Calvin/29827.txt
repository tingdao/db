<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18</strong><em>May the Lord grant to him </em>Some explain it thus: — “May God grant to him that he may find mercy with Christ the Judge.” And, indeed, this is somewhat more tolerable than to interpret that passage in the writings of Moses: </p><p>“The Lord rained fire from the Lord,” (<span class="bvs">Gen_19:24</span>,) </p><p>as meaning, — “The Father rained from the Son.” <span class="cite-ref">(154)</span> Yet it is possible that strong feeling may have prompted Paul, as often happens, to make a superfluous repetition. </p><p><em>That he may find mercy with the Lord on that day </em><span class="cite-ref">(155)</span> This prayer shews us how much richer a recompense awaits those who, without the expectation of an earthly reward, perform kind offices to the saints, than if they received it immediately from the hand of men. And what does he pray for? “That he may find mercy;” for he who hath been merciful to his neighbors will receive such mercy from God to himself. And if this promise does not powerfully animate and encourage us to the exercise of kindness, we are worse than stupid. Hence it follows, also, that when God rewards us, it is not on account of our merits or of any excellence that is in us; but that the best and most valuable reward which he bestows upon us is, when he pardons us, and shews himself to be, not a stern judge, but a kind and indulgent Father. </p><p><strong>(154)</strong> See Calvin on Genesis, vol. 1, p. 512, where that remarkable expression is copiously explained. — Ed. </p><p><strong>(155)</strong> “No Christian can read this passage without being powerfully affected by it; for we see that Paul was, as it were, transported, when he spoke of that coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the final resurrection. He does not say, “May the Lord grant that he may find favor at his coming, on the day of our redemption, when he shall appear again to judge the world!” But he says, “On that day;” as if he presented the Lord Jesus visibly, with his angels. Paul did not speak those things coldly, or like a man, but he rose above all men, that he might be able to exclaim, “That day, that day!” And where is it? True, none of those who wish to be wise in themselves will take any pains to find it; for that saying must be fulfilled, — “Eye hath not seen, ears have not heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, what God hath prepared for them that love him.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_64:4</span>.) Let men task their powers to the utmost to know it, it will be to them a dark and mysterious thing, and they will not be able to approach to it. But when we shall embrace the promise which he hath given to us, and after having known that Christ, being risen from the dead, displayed his power, not for his own sake, but to gather together all his members, and to unite them to himself, then shall we be able truly to say, <em>That day.”-Fr. Ser. </em></p></div>
