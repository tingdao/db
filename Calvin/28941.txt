<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>For ye know the grace. </em>Having made mention of love, he adduces Christ as an all perfect and singular pattern of it. “Though he was rich,” says he, “he resigned the possession of all blessings, that he might enrich us by his poverty.” He does not afterwards state for what purpose he makes mention of this, but leaves it to be considered by them; for no one can but perceive, that we are by this example stirred up to <em>beneficence, </em>that we may not spare ourselves, when help is to be afforded to our brethren. </p><p>Christ <em>was rich, </em>because he was God, under whose power and authority all things are; and farther, even in our human nature, which he put on, as the Apostle bears witness, (<span class="bvs">Heb_1:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Heb_2:8</span>,) he was the <em>heir of all things, </em>inasmuch as he was placed by his Father over all creatures, and all things were placed under his feet. He nevertheless <em>became poor, </em>because he refrained from possessing, and thus he gave up his right for a time. We see, what destitution and penury as to all things awaited him immediately on his coming from his mother’s womb. We hear what he says himself, (<span class="bvs">Luk_9:58</span>,) </p><p>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests: the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. </p><p>Hence he has consecrated poverty in his own person, that believers may no longer regard it with horror. By his <em>poverty </em>he has <em>enriched </em>us all for this purpose — that we may not feel it hard to take from our abundance what we may lay out upon our brethren. </p></div>
