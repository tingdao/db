<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>By emptying shall the earth be emptied. </em>He confirms what he had already said, and declares that those changes will not be accidental, but that they are the work of God. In the first verse, he had expressly stated that God is making preparations for emptying the earth: he now asserts that it will happen, and adds the reason, that God hath purposed and determined to do it. </p></div>
