<div class="comment-content"><p>Now it is an abrupt sentence when he says, <em>Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou hast broken the wooden bands; but make to thee iron bands; </em>Jeremiah does not keep to the same point; for in the first clause he relates what he had been commanded to say to Hananiah; and in the second he relates what God had commanded him to do, even iron bands. But there is no obscurity as to the meaning; for doubtless the Prophet might have arranged his words thus, “Thou hast broken the bands from my neck; but God has commanded me to make new ones from iron.” <span class="cite-ref">(199)</span> Though Jeremiah, then, only tells us here that God commanded him to make iron bands, it may yet be easily concluded that when he spoke of wooden bands he at the same time added what he relates of iron bands, but in a different connection., Now follows the explanation, — </p><p><strong>(199)</strong> It appears that the true reading has been retained here only by the Sept. when the verb “make” is given in the first person; the difference is only the addition of <span class="lang he-il">י</span>; then the sentence would be, — </p><p>The yokes of wood thou hast broken, But I have made for them yokes of iron. </p><p>Or if the vau be considered conversive, the line would be, — </p><p>But I will make for them yokes of iron. </p><p>The exigency of a passage is one of our best guides. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
