<div class="comment-content"><p>He now adds, <em>If remaining ye will remain in this land, I will build you up and plant you, I will not pull you down nor root you up </em>Here the Prophet testifies that the counsel he gave them in God’s name would be for their good; and what is good or useful is deemed by men, when they theorize, as they say, to be of great value. The simple authority of God ought, indeed, to be sufficient; and had God only commanded them in one word to remain, they ought to have acquiesced. But God here accommodated himself to their infirmity, and was pleased, in a manner, to let himself down in order to promote their well being, and did not require obedience according to his authority and sovereign power, as he might have justly done. We hence see how kindly God dealt with this people, as he did not demand what he might, but gave his counsel, and testified that it would be good and useful to them. </p><p>Now when orators adduce what is useful in order to persuade, they have recourse to conjectures, they state human reasons; but the Prophet here promised in God’s name, that that if they remained it would be for their good. God’s promise, then, is brought forward here instead of conjectures and reasons. Therefore the obstinacy of the people was without excuse, when they rejected the authority of God; and then despised his counsel, and also disbelieved his promise. Then to the contempt of God was added unbelief: and we know that no greater reproach can be offered to God than when men do not believe him. </p><p>The metaphors here used occur often in Scripture. God is said to <em>build up </em>men when he confirms them in a settled state; and in the same sense he is said to <em>plant </em>them. This we have already seen, and it is especially evident from <span class="bvs">Psa_44:2</span>, where God is said to have “planted” in the land of Canaan the people he had brought out of Egypt. He then promised that the condition of the people would be secure, and safe, and perpetual, if only they did not change their place. When he adds, I will <em>not pull down nor pluck up, </em>he: follows what is done commonly in Hebrew. Neither the Latins nor the Greeks speak in this manner; but negatives of this kind in Hebrew are confirmations, as though the Prophet had said, “God will so plant you that your root will remain. There will then be no danger of being plucked up when you have been planted by God’s hand; nor will he suffer you to be subverted or pulled down when he has built you up by his own hand.” What then they ought to have especially sought, God freely promised them, even to be safe and secure in the land; for this especially was what the Prophet meant. </p><p>It afterwards follows, <em>For I repent of the evil which I have brought on you. </em>The verb <span class="lang he-il">נחם</span>, <em>nuchem, </em>sometimes means to repent, and often to comfort; but the former sense comports better with this passage, that God repented of the evil. If, however, we prefer this rendering, “For I have received comfort,” then the meaning would be, “I am satisfied with the punishment with which I have visited your sins;” for they to whom satisfaction is given are said to receive comfort. As then God was content with the punishment he had inflicted on the Jews, the words may be rendered thus, “For I have received satisfaction from the evil,” or, “I am satisfied with the evil,” etc. The other meaning, however, is more generally taken, that God repented of the evil. <span class="cite-ref">(128)</span> But this mode of speaking is, indeed, somewhat harsh, yet it contains nothing contrary to the truth; for we know that God often transfers to himself what peculiarly belongs to man. Then repentance in God is nothing else than that having been pacified, he does not pursue men to an extremity, so as to demand the punishment which they justly deserve. Thus, then, God <em>repented of the evil </em>which he had brought on the people, after having sufficiently chastised their sins, according to what we read in Isaiah, when God says, that he had exacted double for their sins. (<span class="bvs">Isa_40:2</span>.) He called the punishment he had inflicted double, not that it exceeded a just measure, but he spoke according to his paternal feeling, that he had treated his people in a harder way than he wished, as a father, who is even displeased with himself when he has been very severe towards his children. </p><p>We now, then, perceive what is meant by the reason here given, that the Jews were not to fear if they dwelt in the land, because God had sufficiently chastised them, and that he was so pacified that he would not further pursue them with severity. Jeremiah at the same time reminds us, that whatever evils happen to us, they ought to be ascribed to God’s judgment, and not to adverse fortune. <em>We </em>hence see that by these words the people were exhorted to repent; for as <em>they </em>were bidden to entertain good hope, because their safety was in God’s hand, so also the Prophet shews that as to the time past <em>they </em>had suffered nothing by chance, but that they had been punished because they had provoked God’s wrath. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(128)</strong> The phrase often occurs, and has ever this meaning; and it is the meaning here, no doubt, though the <em>Sept. </em>and the <em>Vulg. </em>adopt the other sense. The versions often give different senses to the same phrases, which render them unsafe guides. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
