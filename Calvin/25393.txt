<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>But he wishing to justify himself. </em>This question might appear to be of no importance for <em>justifying </em>a man. But if we recollect what was formerly stated, that the hypocrisy of men is elderly detected by means of the second table—for, while they pretend to be eminent worshippers of God, they openly violate charity towards their neighbors—it will be easy to infer from this, that the Pharisee practiced this evasion, in order that, concealed under the false mask of holiness, he might not be brought forth to light. So then, aware that the test of charity would prove unfavorable to him, he seeks concealment under the word <em>neighbor, </em>that he may not be discovered to be a transgressor of the Law. But we have already seen, that on this subject the Law was corrupted by the scribes, because they reckoned none to be their <em>neighbors </em>but those who were worthy of it. Hence, too, this principle was received among them, that we have a right to <em>hate our enemies, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mat_5:43</span>.) For the only method to which hypocrites can resort for avoiding the condemnation of themselves, is to turn away as far as they are able, that their life may not be tried by the judgment of the Law. </p></div>
