It consisted in this, that when he saw the present prosperous state of the wicked, and from it judged them to be happy, he had envied their condition. We are certainly under a grievous and a dangerous temptation, when we not only, in our own minds, quarrel with God for not setting matters in due order, but also when we give ourselves loose reins, boldly to commit iniquity, because it seems to us that we may commit it, and yet escape with impunity. The sneering jest of Dionysius the younger, a tyrant of Sicily, when, after having robbed the temple of Syracuse, he had a prosperous voyage with the plunder, is well known. <span class="cite-ref">(155)</span> “See you not,” says he to those who were with him, “how the gods favor the sacrilegious?” In the same way, the prosperity of the wicked is taken as an encouragement to commit sin; for we are ready to imagine, that, since God grants them so much of the good things of this life, they are the objects of his approbation and favor. We see how their prosperous condition wounded David to the heart, leading him almost to think that there was nothing better for him than to join himself to their company, and to follow their course of life. <span class="cite-ref">(156)</span> By applying to the ungodly the appellation of <em>foolish, </em>he does not simply mean that the sins which they commit are committed through ignorance or inadvertence, but he sets their folly in opposition to the fear of God, which is the principal constituent of true wisdom. <span class="cite-ref">(157)</span> The ungodly are, no doubt, crafty; but, being destitute of the fundamental principle of all right judgment, which consists in this, that we must regulate and frame our lives according to the will of God, they are foolish; and this is the effect of their own blindness. </p><p><strong>(154)</strong> The original word for <em>the foolish </em>signifies “men of no principle, wild, giddy, vain boasters.” Boothroyd renders it “the madly profane,” and Fry, “the vain-glorious.” </p><p><strong>(155)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">On scait assez par les histoires le brocard duquel usa anciennement un tyran de Sicile nomme Denis le jeune, quand apres avoir pille le temple de Syracuses, il se mit sur la mer, et veit qu’il avoit fort bon vent pour naviger</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(156)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et suyvre a leur train</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(157)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Laquelle est le fondement et le comble de sagesse</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “Which is the foundation and the cope-stone of wisdom. </p></div>
