<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Many will say to me </em>Christ again summons hypocrites to his judgment-seat, as we showed a little ago from Luke. So long as they hold a place in his Church, they both flatter themselves and deceive others. He therefore declares, that a day is coming, when he will cleanse his barn, and separate the chaff and straw from the pure wheat. <em>To prophesy in the name of Christ </em>is, to discharge the office of teacher by his authority, and, as it were, under his direction. <em>Prophecy </em>is here, I think, taken in a large sense, as in the fourteenth chapter of the Epistle to the Corinthians. He might have simply used the word <em>preach, </em>but purposely employed the more honorable appellation, in order to show more clearly, that an outward profession is nothing, whatever may be its brilliancy in the eyes of men. <em>To do wonderful works in the name of Christ </em>is nothing else than to perform miracles by his power, authority, command, and direction: for, though the word <span class="lang el-gr">ὁμολογήσω</span>, <em>powers, </em>is sometimes confined to one class of miracles, yet in this and many other passages it denotes every kind of miracles. </p></div>
