<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>For I greatly desire to see you </em>He might, indeed, while absent, have confirmed their faith by his doctrine; but as advice is better taken from one present, he had a desire to be with them. But he explains what his object was, and shows that he wished to undertake the toil of a journey, not for his own, but for their advantage. — <em>Spiritual gifts </em><span class="cite-ref">(34)</span> he calls those which he possessed, being either those of doctrine, or of exhortation, or of prophesy which he knew had come to him through God’s favor. He has here strikingly pointed out the use of gifts by the word, <em>imparting</em>: for different gifts are distributed to each individual, that all may in kindness mutually assist one another, and transfer to others what each one possesses. See <span class="bvs">Rom_12:3</span></p><p><em>To confirm you</em>, <em>etc. </em>He modifies what he had said of imparting, lest he should seem to regard them such as were yet to be instructed in the first elements of religion, as though they were not hitherto rightly taught in Christ. He then says, that he wished so to lend his aid to them, that they who had for the most part made a proficiency, might be further assisted: for a confirmation is what we all want, until Christ be fully formed in us.

Some, such as [<span class="bvs">Chalmers </span>] and [<span class="bvs">Haldane </span>], have supposed that a miraculous power is intended, which the Apostles alone conveyed, such as the power of speaking with tongues: but most Commentators agree in the view here given. The phrase is not found in any other place<span class="lang el-gr">: χάρισμα, </span> in the plural number, is used to designate miraculous powers. <span class="bvs">1Co_12:9</span>; and<span class="lang el-gr">τὰ πνευματικά </span> mean the same, <span class="bvs">1Co_14:1</span>. But here, no doubt, the expression includes any gift or benefit, whether miraculous or ordinary, which the Apostle might have been made the means of conveying. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
