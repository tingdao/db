<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>But he that lacketh these things. </em>He now expresses more clearly that they who profess a naked faith are wholly without any true knowledge. He then says that they go astray like the blind in darkness, because they do not see the right way which is shewn to us by the light of the gospel. <span class="cite-ref">(151)</span> This he also confirms by adding this reason, because such have forgotten that through the benefit of Christ they had been cleansed from sin, and yet this is the beginning of our Christianity. It then follows, that those who do not strive for a pure and holy life, do not understand even the first rudiments of faith. </p><p>But Peter takes this for granted, that they who were still rolling in the filth of the flesh had forgotten their own purgation. For the blood of Christ has not become a washing bath to us, that it may be fouled by our filth. He, therefore, calls them old sins, by which he means, that our life ought to be otherwise formed, because we have been cleansed from our sins; not that any one can be pure from every sin while he lives in this world, or that the cleansing we obtain through Christ consists of pardon only, but that we ought to differ from the unbelieving, as God has separated us for himself. Though, then, we daily sin, and God daily forgives us, and the blood of Christ cleanses us from our sins, yet sin ought not to rule in us, but the sanctification of the Spirit ought to prevail in us; for so Paul teaches us in <span class="bvs">1Co_6:11</span>, “And such were some of you; but ye are washed,” <em>etc. </em></p><p><strong>(151)</strong> “He is blind, (<em>manu palpans </em>) stroking with the hand,” is Calvin's; the <em>Vulgate </em>is <em>manu tentans </em>, “feeling with the hand:” but the original word means, “closing the eyes,” according to the Greek grammarians, <em>Hesychius </em>and <em>Suidas</em>: “He is blind, closing his eyes.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
