<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21</strong><em>If our heart condemns not </em>I have already explained that this refers not to <em>hypocrites </em>nor to the gross despisers of God. For how muchsoever the reprobate may approve of their own lives, yet <em>the Lord</em>, as Solomon says, <em>weigheth their hearts</em>. (<span class="bvs">Pro_16:2</span>.) This balance of God, by which he tries men, is such, that no one can boast that he has a clean heart. The meaning, then, of the Apostle’s words is, that then only we come in calm confidence into God’s presence, when we bring with us the testimony of a heart conscious of what is right and honest. That saying of Paul is indeed true, that by faith, which relies on the grace of Christ, an <em>access </em>to God with confidence is opened to us, (<span class="bvs">Eph_3:12</span>;) and also, that peace is given us by faith, that our consciences may stand peaceably before God. (<span class="bvs">Rom_5:1</span>.) But there is not much difference between these sentences; for Paul shews the cause of confidence, but John mentions only an inseparable addition, which necessarily adheres to it, though it be not the cause. </p><p>Here, however, arises a greater difficulty, which seems to leave no confidence in the whole world; for who can be found whose heart reproves him in nothing? To this I answer, that the godly are thus reproved, that they may at the same time be absolved. For it is indeed necessary that they should be seriously troubled inwardly for their sins, that terror may lead them to humility and to a hatred of themselves; but they presently flee to the sacrifice of Christ, where they have sure peace. Yet the Apostle says, in another sense, that they are not condemned, because however deficient they may confess themselves to be in many things, they are still relieved by this testimony of conscience, that they truly and from the heart fear God and desire to submit to his righteousness. All who possess this godly feeling, and at the same time know that all their endeavors, how muchsoever they come short of perfection, yet please God, are justly said to have a calm or a peaceful heart, because there is no inward compunction to disturb their calm cheerfulness. </p></div>
