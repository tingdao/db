<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Sing unto Jehovah. </em>The better to testify his gratitude, David calls upon all the saints to join with him in singing the praises of God; and under one class he describes the whole body. As he had been preserved beyond all expectation, and by this instance had been instructed concerning God’s continual and infinite goodness towards all the godly, he breaks forth into this exhortation, in which he includes the general deliverance of the whole church as well as his own. He rehearses not only what God had been to himself, but also how bountifully and promptly he is accustomed to assist his people. In short, confirmed by one particular instance he turns his thoughts to the general truth. The meaning of the Hebrew term <span class="lang he-il">חסידים</span>, <em>chasidim, </em>which we have translated <em>meekness, </em>by which David often describes the faithful, has been already shown in the sixteenth Psalm. Their heavenly adoption ought to excite them to the exercise of beneficence, that they may imitate their Father’s disposition, </p><p>“who maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,” (<span class="bvs">Mat_5:45</span>.) </p><p>There is nothing in which men resemble God more truly than in doing good to others. <em>The memorial of his holiness, </em>in the second clause of the verse, may refer to the tabernacle; as if David had exhorted all the children of God to go before the ark of the covenant, which was the memorial of God’s presence. The Hebrew letter <span class="cite-ref">(627)</span><span class="lang he-il">ל</span>, <em>lamed, </em>often denotes a place. I readily subscribe, however, to their opinion, who think that <em>memorial </em>signifies the same thing as <em>name; </em>for God has assuredly rendered himself worthy of remembrance by his works, which are a bright representation of his glory, the sight of which should stir us up to praise him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(627)</span><span class="lang he-il">לזכר</span><em>, lezeker, at the memorial. </em></p></div></div>
