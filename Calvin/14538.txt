<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>For innumerable evils have compassed me on all sides </em>This phrase, in the original, denotes more than can be expressed in an English translation; for he says, <span class="lang he-il">עלי</span><em>alay, upon me, </em>meaning by this, that he was not only beset on all sides, but that also an accumulation of evils pressed upon his head. He, however, does not now complain of being punished unjustly, or above his desert, but rather confesses plainly that it is the just recompense of his sins which is rendered to him. For although the word <span class="lang he-il">עון</span>, <em>avon, </em>which we have rendered <em>iniquity, </em>signifies also <em>the punishment of iniquity, </em>(as we have elsewhere seen more than once;) yet we must take into consideration the derivation of the word. <span class="cite-ref">(95)</span> Accordingly, since David calls the afflictions which he endures the fruit or effect of his transgressions, there is implied in this a humble confession, from which we may ascertain with what reverence and meekness he submitted to the judgments of God, seeing that, when overwhelmed with an accumulation of miseries, he sets forth his sins in all their magnitude and aggravation, lest he should suspect God of undue severity. When we see David treated so severely, let us also learn, when we are oppressed with extreme afflictions, and are groaning under them, humbly to implore the grace and mercy of our Judge. Nor is it his design to show that he had been stupid or hardened, when he says that <em>his heart failed or forsook him. </em>His language means, that he was not only broken-hearted, but that he lay as if he had been dead. We must, however, understand this <em>fainting </em>or <em>failing of the heart </em>as referring to the sense of the flesh; for his perseverance in prayer is a certain proof that his faith was never altogether extinguished. But since he was, in so far as man was concerned, destitute of counsel, and was altogether without strength, it is not without cause that he says that his heart failed him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(95)</span> The word <span class="lang he-il">עוז</span>, <em>avon</em>, is derived from <span class="lang he-il">עוה</span>, <em>avah</em>, <em>he was crooked</em>, <em>oblique</em>; and hence the noun signifies iniquity, depravity, perverseness; but it is also put for the punishment due to iniquity. See volume 1, p. 507, note. </p></div></div>
