<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>Go, tell that fox </em>It is certain, that the person here spoken of is Herod Antipas. Though he had throughout the character of a <em>fox, </em>and was as remarkable for servility as for cunning, I do not think that the term, <em>fox, </em>is intended to refer generally to the cunning of his whole life, but rather to the insidious methods by which he labored to undermine the doctrine of the Gospel, when he did not venture to attack it openly. Christ tells him that, with all his craftiness, he will gain nothing by his schemes. “Whatever artifices he may devise,” says Christ, “<em>today and tomorrow </em>I will discharge the office which God has enjoined upon me; and when I shall have reached the end of my course, I shall then be offered in sacrifice.” That we may perceive more clearly the meaning of the words, Christ acknowledges, in the former part of his message, that on <em>the third </em>day—that is, within a very short time—he must die; and in this way shows, that he could not be deterred from his duty by any fear of death, to which he advanced boldly, with fixed purpose of mind. </p></div>
