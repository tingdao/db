<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>66.</strong><em>Teach me goodness of taste and acknowledge </em>After having confessed that he had found, by experience, the faithfulness of God to his promises, David here adds a request similar to what is contained in the 64<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, namely, that he may grow in right understanding; although the phraseology is somewhat different; for instead of <em>thy statutes, </em>as in that verse, he here uses <em>goodness of taste and knowledge. </em>As the verb <span class="lang he-il">טעם</span><em>taam, </em>signifies <em>to taste, </em>the noun which is derived from it properly denotes <em>taste </em>It is, however, applied to the mind. David, there is no doubt, prays that knowledge, accompanied with sound discretion and judgment, might. be imparted to him. Those who read, disjunctively, <em>goodness and taste, </em>mar the whole sentence. It is, however, necessary, in order to our arriving at the full meaning, that the latter clause should be added. He asserts that he <em>believed God’s commandments, </em>in other words, that he cheerfully embraced whatever is prescribed in the law; and thus he describes himself as docile and obedient. As it was by the guidance of the Holy Spirit that he became thus inclined to obedience, he pleads that another gift may be bestowed upon him — the gift of a sound taste and good understanding. Whence we learn, that these two things, right affection and good understanding, are indispensably necessary to the due regulation of the life. The prophet already believed God’s commandments; but his veneration for the law, proceeding from a holly zeal, led him to desire conformity to it, and made him afraid, and not without cause, of inconsiderately going astray. Let us then learn, that after God has framed our hearts to the obedience of his law, we must, at the same time, ask wisdom from him by which to regulate our zeal. </p></div>
