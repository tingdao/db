<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>He rebuked the winds </em>Mark relates also the words of Christ, by which, addressing the sea, he enjoins <em>silence, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">σιώπα</span>,) that is, <em>stillness </em>not that the lake had any perception, but to show that the power of his voice reached the elements, which were devoid of feeling. And not only the <em>sea and the winds, </em>which are without feeling, but wicked men also, with all their obstinacy, obey the commands of God. For when God is pleased to allay the tumults of war, he does not always soften the fierce minds of men, and mould them to obedience, but even while their rage continues, makes the arms to drop from their hands: And thus is fulfilled that declaration, </p><p>He maketh wars to cease to the ends of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in pieces, and burneth the chariots in the fire, (<span class="bvs">Psa_46:10</span>.) </p></div>
