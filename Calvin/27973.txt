<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>There is no respect of persons, etc. </em>He has hitherto generally arraigned all mortals as guilty; but now he begins to bring home his accusation to the Jews and to the Gentiles separately: and at the same time he teaches us, that it is no objection that there is a difference between them, but that they are both without any distinction exposed to eternal death. The Gentiles pretended ignorance as their defense; the Jews gloried in the honor of having the law: from the former he takes away their subterfuge, and he deprives the latter of their false and empty boasting. </p><p>There is then a division of the whole human race into two classes; for God had separated the Jews from all the rest, but the condition of all the Gentiles was the same. He now teaches us, that this difference is no reason why both should not be involved in the same guilt. But the word<em>person </em>is taken in Scripture for all outward things, which are wont to be regarded as possessing any value or esteem. When therefore thou readest, that God is no respecter of persons, understand that what he regards is purity of heart or inward integrity; and that he hath no respect for those things which are wont to be highly valued by men, such as kindred, country, dignity, wealth, and similar things; so that respect of persons is to be here taken for the distinction or the difference there is between one nation and another. <span class="cite-ref">(68)</span> But if any hence objects and says, “That then there is no such thing as the gratuitous election of God;” it may be answered, That there is a twofold acceptation of men before God; the first, when he chooses and calls us from nothing through gratuitous goodness, as there is nothing in our nature which can be approved by him; the second, when after having regenerated us, he confers on us his gifts, and shows favor to the image of his Son which he recognizes in us. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(68)</span> The word<span class="lang el-gr">προσωποληψία, </span> respect of persons, is found in three other places, <span class="bvs">Eph_6:9</span>; <span class="bvs">Col_3:25</span>; and <span class="bvs">Jas_2:1</span>; and in these the reference is to conditions in life. In <span class="bvs">Act_10:34</span>, the word is in another form<span class="lang el-gr">προσωπολήπτης, </span> a respecter of persons, and as a verb in <span class="bvs">Jas_2:9</span>. The full phrase is<span class="lang el-gr">πρόσωπον λαμβάνω, </span> as found in <span class="bvs">Luk_20:21</span>, and <span class="bvs">Gal_2:6</span>. It is a phrase peculiar to the Hebrew language, and means literally, <em>to lift up or regard faces, </em>that is, <em>persons, </em><span class="lang he-il">נשא פנים</span>. See <span class="bvs">Lev_19:15</span>; <span class="bvs">Deu_10:17</span>; <span class="bvs">2Ch_19:7</span></p><p>An argument has been hence taken to oppose the doctrine of election; but this is to apply to a particular thing what belongs entirely and exclusively to another. This belongs to the administration of justice, but election is the exercise of mercy. Even [<span class="bvs">Grotius </span>] admits, that God manifests a difference in bestowing benefits, but not in exercising Judgment. Indeed, in the present instance, with regard to the subject handled by the Apostle, there was a manifest difference; the Gentile had only the law of nature, but the Jew had a revealed law. Yet when brought to judgment there was to be no respect of persons, each was to be judged impartially according to the circumstances of his condition. And further, election does not proceed on the principle of showing respect of persons, that is, of regarding men according to their privileges or outward circumstances, or kindred or relation in life, or any thing in man; but its sole and exclusive ground or reason is the good pleasure of God. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
