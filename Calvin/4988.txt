<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And this land, which we possessed at that time. </em>In this passage Moses confirms his decision, that the possession of the country beyond Jordan should be insured to the Reubenites and Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh. For, since it had fallen to them exceptionally, the matter might be brought into controversy with posterity. Lest, then, any should disturb them, he again declares that they were the rightful possessors of that district. Moreover, inasmuch as the very gift of it might be called in question, since it was situated outside the bounds of the inheritance promised by God, Moses anticipates this objection also, asserting that God had not in vain given it to be possessed by His people. Hence it follows that the right of inhabiting it was conferred upon them. Lest, then, so unequal a partition should be made a subject of contention, he marks out their boundaries on every side, as though he set up the authority of God as a wall and rampart against any who should presume to invade it. </p><p>With reference to the names of the places, the Dead Sea is called the Sea of Salt, and the Lake of Genesera or Gennesareth, Chinnereth. As to the “outpourings of the hill,” translators are not agreed; for some consider Ashdoth-Pisgah to be the proper name of a city. <span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> I prefer, however, to take the word “outpourings” <em>(effusionum) </em>appellatively, not for fountains and streams, but for the root (of the hill) where the ground by a gentle descent seems in a manner to pour itself forth. We shall presently see that Pisgah was one of the summits of Mount Abarim. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(220)</span><span class="lang he-il">אשדת הפסגה</span><em>A.V. </em>“Ashdoth-Pisgah;”<em>marg., </em>“The springs of Pisgah, or, of the hill.” The <em>LXX</em>. in like manner only substitutes Greek letters for the Hebrew, treating both words as proper names. But when the same words occur at the close of the next chapter, our translators have placed their previous marginal translation in their text, and the <em>LXX. </em>instead of <span class="lang el-gr">Φασγὰ </span> have <span class="lang el-gr">τὴν λαξευτήν</span>, as though <span class="lang he-il">פסגה</span> were an appellative, from <span class="lang he-il">פסג</span> to cut. In construing <span class="lang he-il">אשדת</span> as a noun, from <span class="lang he-il">אשד</span> and rendering it <em>effusions, C. </em>followed <em>S.M., </em>as also in putting the <em>hill </em>for Pisgah. Our translators and Luther have agreed in rendering the former word <em>springs, </em>when it occurs in <span class="bvs">Jos_10:40</span>, and 12:8; whilst the <em>LXX. </em>and Diodati have treated it as a proper name in both those texts. —<em>W </em></p></div></div>
