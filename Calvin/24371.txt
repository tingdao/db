<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_5:6</span><em>Worshipped him </em><span class="cite-ref">(549)</span> The arrangement of the narrative may be thus stated. When the demoniacs came to meet him, Christ ordered <em>the unclean spirits to go out of them, </em>and then they prayed and entreated that he would not <em>torment them before the time </em>The <em>worship, </em>therefore, did not precede Christ’s words: nor did they complain that Christ gave them uneasiness, <span class="cite-ref">(550)</span> till he urged them to go out. We ought to be aware that they did not come of their own accord into the presence of Christ, but were drawn by a secret exercise of his authority. As they had formerly been accustomed to carry men off, in furious violence, to <em>the tombs, </em>so now a superior power compels them to appear reluctantly at the tribunal of their judge. </p><p>Hence we infer, that the whole of Satan’s kingdom is subject to the authority of Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(551)</span> For the devils, when Christ summons them to appear before him, are not more at their own disposal than were the wretched men whom their tyranny was wont to drive about in every direction. At length, by the secret power of Christ, they are dragged before him, that, by casting them out, he may prove himself to be the deliverer of men. Reluctantly too they <em>worship </em>him, and their rebellious complaints testify that their confession was not made from choice, but was drawn from them by force. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(549)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">S'enclina devant luy</span>;” — “kneeled down before him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(550)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et ils ne se sont point plainds que Christ les tormentast, sinon quand il les pressoit de sortir</span>;” — “and they did not complain that Christ tormented them, till he urged them to go out.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(551)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que tout le regne de Satan est tenu en bride sous la domination de Christ</span>;” — “that all the kingdom of Satan is kept in check under the government of Christ.” </p></div></div>
