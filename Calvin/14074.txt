<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Thou, O Jehovah. </em>Some think that the language of the Psalmist here is that of renewed prayer; and they, therefore, understand the words as expressive of his desire, and translate them in the optative mood, thus, <em>Do thou, O Jehovah, keep them </em><span class="cite-ref">(266)</span> But I am rather of opinion that David, animated with holy confidence, boasts of the certain safety of all the godly, of whom God, who neither can deceive nor lie, avows himself to be the guardian. At the same time, I do not altogether disapprove of the interpretation which views David as renewing his supplications at the throne of grace. Some give this exposition of the passage, <em>Thou wilt keep them, </em>namely, <em>thy words; </em><span class="cite-ref">(267)</span> but this does not seem to me to be suitable. <span class="cite-ref">(268)</span> David, I have no doubt, returns to speak of the poor, of whom he had spoken in the preceding part of the psalm. With respect to his changing the number, (for, he says first, <em>Thou wilt keep them, </em>and, next, <em>Thou wilt preserve him </em><span class="cite-ref">(269)</span> it is a thing quite common in Hebrew, and the sense is not thereby rendered ambiguous. These two sentences, therefore, <em>Thou wilt keep them, </em>and <em>Thou wilt preserve him, </em>signify the same thing, unless, perhaps, we may say that, in the second, under the person of one man, the Psalmist intends to point out the small number of good men. To suppose this is not unreasonable or improbable; and, according to this view, the import of his language is, Although only one good man should be left alive in the world, yet he would be kept in perfect safety by the grace and protection of God. But as the Jews, when they speak generally, often change the number, I leave my readers freely to form their own judgment. This, indeed, cannot be controverted, that by the word <em>generation, </em>or <em>race, </em>is denoted a great multitude of ungodly persons, and almost the whole body of the people. As the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">דור</span>, <em>dor, </em>signifies as well the men who live in the same age, as the space of time itself, David, without doubt, here means that the servants of God cannot escape, and continue safe, unless God defend them against the malice of the whole people, and deliver them from the wicked and perverse men of the age in which they live. Whence we learn that the world, at that time, was so corrupt, that David, by way of reproach, puts them all, as it were, into one bundle. Moreover, it is of importance again to remember what we have already stated, that he does not here speak of foreign nations, but of the Israelites, and God’s chosen people. It is well to mark this carefully, that we may not be discouraged by the vast multitude of the ungodly, if we should sometimes see an immense heap of chaff upon the barn-floor of the Lord, while only a few grains of corn lie hidden underneath. And then, however small may be the number of the good, let this persuasion be deeply fixed in our minds, that God will be their protector, and that for ever. The word <span class="lang he-il">לעולם</span>,<em>leolam, </em>which signifies<em>for ever, </em>is added, that we may learn to extend our confidence in God far into the future, seeing he commands us to hope for succor from him, not only once, or for one day, but as long as the wickedness of our enemies continues its work of mischief. We are, however, from this passage, at the same time, admonished that war is not prepared against us for a short time only, but that we must daily engage in the conflict. And if the guardianship which God exercises over the faithful is sometimes hidden, and is not manifest in its effects, let them wait in patience until he arise; and the greater the flood of calamities which overflows them, let them keep themselves so much the more in the exercise of godly fear and solicitude. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(266)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que tu les gardes, Seigneur</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(267)</span> This is the view adopted by <em>Hammond</em>.
