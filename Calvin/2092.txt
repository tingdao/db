<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor</em>. He expresses the same thing in different ways; for although there is a wide difference between slaying a man presumptuously <span class="cite-ref">(32)</span> and with guile, yet Moses applies them both to a willful murder; for by <em>guile </em>he means a wicked disposition to injure, and by the word <em>presumptuous </em>he designates a violent assault, when a man in hate wantonly falls upon another. And surely truculence, and violence, and all cruelty is presumptuous, (<em>superba</em>;) for unless a man despised his brother, he would not assail him as an enemy. </p><p>Lest by overlooking murders they should defile the land, God commands that murderers should be torn away even from His altar, whereby He signifies that they are as unworthy of divine as of human aid. For, although the sanctity of the altar might afford an asylum for the protection of those who had transgressed through imprudence, or. error, yet it would have been wrong that impunity for crimes should have been derived from hence; because the sanctuary would have been thus converted into a den of thieves, and religion would have been subjected to gross profanation. Wherefore, although criminals embracing the altar should implore God’s aid, the Law commands them to be torn away from thence to punishment, because it would have been disgraceful to abuse God’s sacred name as affording license for sin. Hence it appears how great was the folly of old in supposing that churches were honored when they were made asylums for the encouragement of evil deeds. This, indeed, was derived from the ordinary custom of the heathen; but it was a foolish imitation thus to mix up God with idols in a spurious worship; although in this respect the Gentiles served their idols more purely and virtuously than the Christians <span class="cite-ref">(33)</span> served God; for they refused the right of asylum to the sacrilegious and impure, so that the temple of the Samothracians was no secure hiding-place even to Perseus, <span class="cite-ref">(34)</span> the king of Macedon. Livy records the following words, as having been spoken by a heathen, — “Since, at the commencement of all our sacrifices, those whose hands are not pure are enjoined to retire, will ye suffer your sanctuaries to be contaminated by the blood-stained person of a robber?” Let us, then, be ashamed of polluting our temples under the pretext of reverence for them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(32)</span> “<em>Superbire</em>, et <em>insidiari </em>longe differunt.” — Lat. “Ruer sup quelqu’un par <em>fierte et malice</em>, et <em>l </em>’<em>aguetter</em>. ” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(33)</span> “Ceux qui se glorifioyent du titre de Chrestiente;“ those who prided themselves in the name of Christians. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(34)</span> See Livy, lib. 45:5. The words quoted are from an address of a certain L. Atilius to the popular assembly of Samothracia. </p></div></div>
