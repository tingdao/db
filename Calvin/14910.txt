<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Thou, O God! shalt make a liberal rain to fall </em><span class="cite-ref">(19)</span><em>upon thine inheritance </em>Mention is made here of the continued course of favor which had been extended to the people from the time when they first entered the promised land. It is called <em>the inheritance of God, </em>as having been assigned over to his own children. Others understand by the inheritance spoken of in the verse, <em>the Church, </em>but this is not correct, for it is afterwards stated as being the place where the Church dwelt. The title is appropriately given to the land of Canaan, which God made over to them by right of inheritance. David takes notice of the fact, that, from the first settlement of the seed of Abraham in it, God had never ceased to make the kindest fatherly provision for them, sending his rain in due season to prepare their food. The words translated a <em>liberal rain, </em>read literally in the Hebrew <em>a rain of freenesses, </em>and I agree with interpreters in thinking that he alludes to the blessing as having come in the exercise of free favor, <span class="cite-ref">(20)</span> and to God, as having of his own unprompted goodness provided for all the wants of his people. Some read <em>a desirable rain; </em>others, <em>a rain flowing without violence, </em>or <em>gentle; </em>but neither of these renderings seems eligible. Others read <em>a copious </em>or <em>plentiful rain; </em>but I have already stated what appears to me to be the preferable sense. It was a proof, then, of his Divine liberality, that God watered the land seasonably with showers. There is clearly a reference to the site of Judea, which owed its fertility to dews and the rains of heaven. In allusion to the same circumstance, he speaks of <em>its being refreshed when weary. </em>The reason is assigned — because it had been given to his chosen people to dwell in. On no other account was it blessed, than as being the habitation of God’s Church and people. The more to impress upon the minds of the Jews their obligations to Divine goodness, he represents them as <em>pensioners </em>depending upon God for their daily food. He fed them upon the finest of the wheat, giving them wine, and honey, and oil in abundance — still he proportioned the communication of his kindness so as to keep them always dependent in expectation upon himself. Some, instead of reading, <em>Thou wilt prepare with thy goodness, etc., </em>render it, <em>Thou wilt prepare with rich food; </em>but, without absolutely objecting to this translation, I rather think that he adverts to the circumstance of God’s being led to provide for his people entirely by his own good pleasure. </p><p><strong>(19)</strong> Heb. <em>Shall shake out</em>, <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , from the clouds, <em>a liberal rain</em>. </p><p><strong>(20)</strong> Ainsworth reads, “a rain of liberalities.” Horsley, “a shower of unmerited kindnesses;” “literally,” says he, “<em>a plentiful rain</em>, rain being used here metaphorically.” </p></div>
