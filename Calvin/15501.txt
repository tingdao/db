<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>Jehovah reigns </em>The people, who were formerly called upon to rejoice, are now commanded to tremble. For as the Jews were encompassed by enemies, it was of the utmost importance that God’s power should be magnified among them, that they might know that, while under his guardianship, they would be constantly and completely safe from the hatred and fury of every foe. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">רגז</span>, <em>ragaz, </em>as we have elsewhere seen, sometimes signifies <em>to tremble, </em>at other times, <em>to be angry, </em>and, in short, denotes any strong emotion arising either from anger or fear. <span class="cite-ref">(115)</span> Accordingly, the prophet here intends that God, in the emancipation of his chosen people, should give such a palpable display of his power, as would strike all the nations with dismay, and make them feel how madly they had rushed upon their own destruction. For it is with regard to men that God is said to reign, when he exalts himself by the magnificent displays which he gives of his power; because, while the aid which he gives to them remains invisible, unbelievers act a more presumptuous part, just as if there were no God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(115)</span><span class="lang he-il">רגז</span>, <em>ragaz</em>, “denoting commotion either of the body or mind, imports in the latter acceptation particularly two things, <em>fear </em>and <em>anger</em>, those two principal emotions of the mind. In the sense of anger we have it in <span class="bvs">Gen_45:24</span>, where we render it <em>falling out </em>or <em>quarrelling</em>, and in <span class="bvs">2Kg_19:27</span>, where we render it <em>rage </em>So, <span class="bvs">Pro_29:9</span>, and in <span class="bvs">Gen_41:10</span>, the Hebrew <span class="lang he-il">קצף</span>, (affirmed of Pharaoh, viz., that) <em>he was wroth</em>, is by the Chaldee rendered <span class="lang he-il">רגז</span>. And this is much the more frequent acceptation of the word in the Old Testament.” — <em>Hammond </em>’<em>s note </em>on <span class="bvs">Psa_4:4</span>. On the text before us, after observing that Abu Walid explains this root as signifying in the Arabic <em>trembling </em>and <em>commotion</em>, arising sometimes from anger, sometimes from fear, and other causes, the same critic says, “Here the context may seem to direct the taking it in the notion of commotion simply, as that signifies <span class="lang el-gr">ἀκαταστασία</span>, <em>sedition </em>or <em>tumult of rebels </em>or other adversaries. And then the sense will be thus: ‘The Lord reigneth, let the people be moved,’<em>i e</em>. , Now God hath set up David in his throne, and peaceably settled the kingdom in him, in spite of all the commotions of the people. The LXX. render it to this sense, as <span class="bvs">Psa_4:4</span>, <span class="lang el-gr">ὀργιζέσθωσαν</span>, ‘let the people be angry or regret it as much as they will.’” The verb here, and the concluding verb of the verse, may be read in the future tense: “The people <em>or </em>nations shall tremble, and the earth shall be moved,” just as at the giving of the Law, “the people trembled,” and “the earth shook.” Thus the passage may be regarded as a prediction of the subjection of the heathen world to the dominion of Christ. </p></div></div>
