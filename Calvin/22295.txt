<div class="comment-content"><p>He then adds, <em>Tell it to your children, your children to their children, their children to the next generation. </em>In this verse the Prophet shows that the matter deserved to be remembered, and was not to be despised by posterity, even for many generations. It appears now quite clear that the Prophet threatens not what was to be, as some interpreters think; it would have been puerile: but, on the contrary, he expostulates here with the Jews, because they were so slothful and tardy in considering God’s judgments; and especially as it was a remarkable instance, when God employed not usual means, but roused, and, as it were, terrified men by prodigies. <em>Of this </em>then<em>tell: </em>for <span class="lang he-il">עליה</span><em>olie </em>means no other thing than ‘tell or declare this thing to your children;’ and further, <em>your children to their children. </em>When any thing new happens, it may be, that we are at first moved with some wonder; but our feeling soon vanishes with the novelty, and we disregard what at first caused great astonishment. But the Prophet here showed, that such was the judgment of God of which he speaks, that it ought not to have been overlooked, no, not even by posterity. <em>Let your children, </em>he says, <em>declare it </em>to those after them, and their children to the fourth generation: it was to be always remembered. </p></div>
