By this instance we are taught that the tortures of the saints, endured by them in behalf of the gospel, are a ground of confidence <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span> to us. It were indeed a dreadful spectacle, and such as might tend rather to dishearten us, did we see nothing but the cruelty and rage of the persecutors. When, however, we see at the same time the hand of the Lord, which makes his people unconquerable, <span class="cite-ref">(66)</span> under the infirmity of the Cross, and causes them to triumph, relying upon this, <span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> we ought to venture farther than we had been accustomed, having now a pledge of our victory in the persons of our brethren. The knowledge of this ought to overcome our fears, that we may speak boldly in the midst of dangers. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(65)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Confiance et asseurance</span>;” — “Confidence and assurance.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(66)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Courageux et inuincibles</span>;” — “Courageous and unconquerable.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(67)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Estans assuerez sur ceste main et puissance du Seigneur</span>;” — “Confidently relying upon this hand and power of the Lord.” </p></div></div>
