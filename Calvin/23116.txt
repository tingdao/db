<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here teaches us, that neither the priests nor the people would go unpunished, because they had mingled with the pollutions of the heathens, and profaned and violated the covenant of God. God then says, <em>Cut off </em>(the word means to scrape off or to blot out) <em>shall God the man who has done this, the mover</em>, or prompter, <em>as well as the respondent </em><span class="cite-ref">(230)</span><em>Jerome </em>renders the last words, the master and the disciple; and interpreters vary. Some indeed explain the terms allegorically, and apply them to the dead; but by the mover, I have no doubt, he understands every one who was in power, and could command others, and by the respondent the man who was subject to the authority of his master. The masters then prompted or roused, for it belonged to them to command; and the servants responded, for it was their duty to receive orders and to obey them. It is the same as though the Prophet had said, that God would punish this perfidy, without passing by any, so that he would spare neither the common people nor the chief men: and he also adds the priests, intimating, that the priests themselves would not be excepted. </p><p>In short, he denounces punishment on the Jews universally, and shows that however prevalent had this impiety become everywhere, and that though every one thought that whatever was commonly practiced was lawful, yet God would become an avenger, and would include in the same punishment both the masters and the servants, and would not exempt the priests, who considered themselves safe by peculiar privilege. The rest tomorrow. </p><p><strong>(230)</strong>   </p><p><em>Him that teacheth and him that answereth. </em>—Newcome </p><p><em>or</em>, </p><p><em>Him that passeth out and him that returneth. </em>—Ib. </p><p><em>Him that watcheth and him that answereth. </em>—Henderson </p><p><em>The teacher and the scholar. </em>—Drusius<em>and </em>Grotius </p><p>The most literal rendering is, — </p><p>The rouser and the respondent, <span class="lang he-il">ער ועגה</span></p><p>It seems to mean the leader in the faction and his assistant, the bold answer of his wickedness and his timid follower.
