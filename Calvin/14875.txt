<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Shout unto God, all the earth </em>The psalm begins with this general declaration, which is afterwards reduced to particulars. <span class="cite-ref">(467)</span> He addresses himself to the whole world, and from this it would seem evident, that he predicts the extent to which the kingdom of God should reach at the coming of Christ. In the second verse the call is repeated with increasing vehemency, to stir up to the praises of God, such as might otherwise be remiss in the service. <em>To sing the honor of his name, </em>is an expression sufficiently obvious; meaning, that we should extol his sacred name in a manner suitable to its dignity, so that it may obtain its due and deserved adoration. But the clause which follows is rather ambiguous. Some think that it conveys a repetition of the same idea contained in other words, and read, <em>set forth the glory of his praise. </em><span class="cite-ref">(468)</span> I prefer taking the Hebrew word signifying<em>praise </em>to be in the accusative case; rendering the words literally, <em>make a glory his praise. </em>And by this I understand him to mean, not as some do, that we should glory exclusively in his praises, <span class="cite-ref">(469)</span> but simply, that we highly exalt his praises, that they may be glorious. The Psalmist is not satisfied with our declaring them moderately, and insists that we should celebrate his goodness in some measure proportionably to its excellence. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(467)</span> “Generalis est praefatio, quam mox sequentur hypotheses.” —<em>Lat</em>. “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est une preface generale, dont les applications speciales suivent incontinent apres</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(468)</span> Hammond’s objection to this is, that if <span class="lang he-il">כבור</span>, <em>glory</em>, were in the construct state, governing the noun which follows, and giving this reading, <em>the glory of his</em>, <em>praise</em>, the vowel should be changed from <em>kamets</em>, to <em>segol </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(469)</span> This is Aben Ezra’s view.
