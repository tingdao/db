<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Finally. </em>Resuming his general exhortations, he again enjoins them to <em>be strong, </em>— to summon up courage and vigor; for there is always much to enfeeble us, and we are ill fitted to resist. But when our weakness is considered, an exhortation like this would have no effect, unless <em>the Lord </em>were present, and stretched out his hand to render assistance, or rather, unless he supplied us with all the power. Paul therefore adds, <em>in the Lord</em>. As if he had said, “‘You have no right to reply, that you have not the ability; for all that I require of you is, <em>be strong in the Lord. </em>” To explain his meaning more fully, he adds, <em>in the power of his might, </em>which tends greatly to increase our confidence, particularly as it shews the remarkable assistance which God usually bestows upon believers. If the Lord aids us by <em>his mighty power, </em>we have no reason to shrink from the combat. But it will be asked, What purpose did it serve to enjoin the Ephesians to be strong in the Lord’s mighty power, which they could not of themselves accomplish? I answer, there are two clauses here which must be considered. He exhorts them to be courageous, but at the same time reminds them to ask from God a supply of their own deficiencies, and promises that, in answer to their prayers, the power of God will be displayed. </p></div>
