<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah, then, <em>wrote in a book all the evil which was to come on Babylon, </em>even <em>all those words, </em>(he refers to the prophecies which we have seen;) <em>and Jeremiah said to Seraiah, </em><span class="cite-ref">(112)</span><em>etc</em>. Here the boldness of Jeremiah comes to view, that he hesitated not to command Seraiah to read this book when he came to Babylon and had seen it. To see it, is not mentioned here without reason, for the splendor of that city might have astonished Seraiah. Then the Prophet here seasonably meets the difficulty, and bids him to disregard the height of the walls and towers; and that however Babylon might dazzle the eyes of others, yet he was to look down, as from on high, on all that pomp and pride: <em>When thou enterest </em>the city, <em>and hast seen it, then read this book </em>The verb <span class="lang he-il">קרא</span><em>, kora, </em>means to call, to proclaim, and also to read. Then Seraiah must have read this book by himself; nor do I doubt but that the words ought to be so understood, as we shall see. It was not then necessary for Seraiah to have a pulpit, or in a public way to read the book to an assembled people; but it was sufficient to read it privately by himself, without any witnesses; and this may be gathered from the context. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(112)</span> That the connection may appear more evident, <span class="bvs">Jer_51:60</span> and the first sentence in <span class="bvs">Jer_51:61</span> ought to be put within a parenthesis; for “the word which Jeremiah commanded Seraiah,” mentioned in <span class="bvs">Jer_51:59</span>, is what follows, “When thou comest to Babylon,” etc. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
