<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Beguiling, </em>or <em>baiting</em>, <em>unstable souls. </em>By the metaphor of <em>baiting </em>he reminds the faithful to beware of their hidden and deceitful arts; for he compares their impostures to hooks which may catch the unwary to their destruction. By adding <em>unstable souls </em>he shews the reason for caution, that is, when we have not struck firm roots in faith and in the fear of the Lord: and he intimates at the same time, that they have no excuse who suffer themselves to be baited or lured by such flatteries; for this must have been ascribed to their levity. Let there be then a stability of faith, and we shall be safe from the artifices of the ungodly. </p><p><em>An heart they have exercised with covetous practices, </em>or, <em>with lusts</em>. Erasmus renders the last word, “rapines.” The word is of a doubtful meaning. I prefer “lusts.” As he had before condemned incontinence in their eyes, so he now seems to refer to the vices latent in their hearts. It ought not, however, to be confined to covetousness. By calling them <em>cursed </em>or execrable <em>children</em>, he may be understood to mean, that they were so either actively or passively, that is, that they brought a curse with them wherever they went, or that they deserved a curse. </p></div>
