<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_11:30</span><strong>.</strong><em>As Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites. </em>He declares that he will be <em>a sign </em>to them, as <em>Jonah </em>was to the inhabitants of Nineveh. But the word <em>sign </em>is not taken in its ordinary sense, as pointing out something, but as denoting what is widely removed from the ordinary course of nature. In this sense Jonah’s mission was miraculous, when he was brought out of the belly of the fish, as if from the grave, to call <em>the Ninevites </em>to repentance. <em>Three days and three nights </em>This is in accordance with a well-known figure of speech. <span class="cite-ref">(166)</span> As the <em>night </em>is an appendage to the <em>day, </em>or rather, as the day consists of two parts, light and darkness, he expresses a day by a day and a night, and where there was half a day, he puts down a whole day. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(166)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quant aux </span><em class="lang fr-fr">trois nuits, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">il y a ici (cornme on scait bien) une figure que les Grecs et Latins appellent Synecdoche</span>;” — “as to the <em>three nights, </em>there is here (as is well known) a figure which the Greek and Latin writers call Synecdoche.” </p></div></div>
