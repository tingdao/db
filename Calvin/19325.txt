<div class="comment-content"><p>He proceeds with his narrative; he says, that fruitful women had been weakened, not as we see to be often the case, for by frequent child — bearing we know the strength of women is diminished; but here he speaks of the strength which mothers derive from their children; for a numerous offspring is the support of mothers. She then who has many children seems strong, as she is by so many shields defended. As then mothers were wont to place much dependence on their offspring, he says that they were weakened as to their strength when they were bereaved of all their children, as though they had been barren. </p><p>He afterwards adds, that the <em>soul, </em>the people, <em>had expired; </em>for he speaks not here of women, but of the whole people. For it afterwards follows, <em>Set hath her sun while it was yet day; </em>that is, when prosperity seemed certain, God suddenly involved them in adversity, and as it were surrounded them with darkness, when they thought that prosperous fortune was slhining on them. He at last says, that they were <em>confounded and ashamed; </em>and at the same time he declares, that he would give all who remained to the sword before their enemies; as though he had said, “They have not yet suffered all the punishment allotted to them, for they are not subdued, though I have heavily and severely chastised them; as then they are incurable, the sword shall destroy the remainder; for my vengeance shall not cease to pursue them, until I shall utterly consume them. <span class="cite-ref">(137)</span></p><p><strong>(137)</strong> The whole passage, including the 7<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, 8<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, and 9<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verses (<span class="bvs">Jer_15:7</span>) presents difficulties as to the time intended. The verbs, from the middle of the 7<span class="cite-ref">th</span> to the last clause in verse the 9<span class="cite-ref">th</span>, are all in the past tense, and are so given in the <em>Septuagint, Vulgate</em>, and the <em>Targum</em>; but in the <em>Syriac </em>in the future tense. Our version is not uniform. It is better to give the tenses as they are, for the reference seems to be to God’s past judgments; and at the end of the 9<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, God speaks of what he would do, — </p><p><strong>7.</strong>And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land. I have bereaved, I have destroyed my people; From their ways have they not turned: </p><p><strong>8.</strong>Increased to me have their (people) widows More than the sand of the sea; I brought on them, on the mother of they youth, A disaster at mid-day; I caused to come upon her suddenly Tumult and terrors: </p><p><strong>9.</strong>Languish did she who gave birth to seven, Pant for breath did her soul, Set did her sun during the day time, Ashamed has she been and confounded: And the remainder of them to the sword will I give, In the presence of their enemies, saith Jehova. </p><p>As he speaks of bereavement, of widows, and of giving birth to seven, it seems evident, that “the mother of the youths,” or of young men. Whether mother is to be taken here metaphorically for Jerusalem, is another question; but I think otherwise. The loss of mothers as to their children is what is spoken of. And from having mentioned the case of mothers in their bereavement, the Prophet in the next verse refers to his own mother, and to his own unhappy condition, — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
