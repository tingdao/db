<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Salute Prisca </em><span class="cite-ref">(470)</span><em>and Aquila </em>The testimonies which he brings here in favor of some individuals, were partly intended for this end, that by honoring those who were faithful and worthy, faithfulness itself might be honored, and that they who could and would do more good than others, might have authority; and partly that they themselves might study to act in a manner corresponding to their past life, and not fail in their religious course, nor ever grow languid in their pious ardor. </p><p>It is a singular honor which he ascribes here to Prisca and Aquila, especially with regard to a woman. The modesty of the holy man does on this account more clearly shine forth; for he disdained not to have a woman as his associate in the work of the Lord; nor was he ashamed to confess this. She was the wife of Aquila, and <em>Luke </em>calls her Priscilla.

See <span class="bvs">Act_18:2</span>, and <span class="bvs">2Ti_4:19</span>, where she is also called Prisca.

It is somewhat singular, that the wife, not only here but in several other instances, though not in all, is mentioned before the husband. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
