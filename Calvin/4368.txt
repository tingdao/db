<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Wherefore, they that speak in proverbs. </em>That is, an old saying, or proverbial sentence remains, and is well known. The song, however, appears to have been composed in the character of those who, when prepared to engage in war, mutually exhorted each other, “Come into Heshbon,” i.e., run to the standard of king Sihon; hasten to his home, and his chief place of abode, in order that we may thence go forth to battle. These expressions, “build and prepare,” I interpret as being used for enlarge, adorn, and enrich; for it is probable that this city was not overthrown, but they foretell that the city would be renovated, when a larger dominion had been gained. And this is more fully confirmed by what immediately follows, when it is said that “a fire had gone forth from Heshbon,” which consumed Ar of Moab, and all its neighborhood. As to the “lords of the high places of Arnon,” some understand the priests who presided in the temples; others extend them to all the inhabitants in general; but, in my opinion, it will not be unsuitable to refer them to the idols themselves, since it appears from the next verse that the conquerors were so insolently elated, as not only to despise the men themselves, but their gods also; for when they say, “Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh,” there is no doubt but that they mockingly reproach them with the fact that they had been badly defended by the gods whom they worshipped. <span class="cite-ref">(132)</span> And, in point of fact, ungodly men, when in prosperity, uplift their horns to heaven, as if they would assail the divinity which was opposed to them. They, therefore, deride Chemosh, because he made “his sons” or worshippers to be fugitives or captives. </p><p>In the word <em>lantern </em><span class="cite-ref">(133)</span> he makes use of a common metaphor. Some follow the Chaldee interpreter, and render it <em>kingdom; </em>but it has a wider signification; for it includes all the component parts of a happy and prosperous state. <span class="cite-ref">(134)</span> The meaning, therefore, is, that their glory and all their wealth was annihilated. The cities of Dibon and Medeba are situated on the extreme borders, near the river Arnon, so that by these he designates all the intermediate plain. </p><p><strong>(132)</strong> “Par Chamos, qu’ils adoroyent comme leur patron;” by Chemosh, whom they worshipped as their patron. — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(133)</strong><span class="lang he-il">ונירם</span><em>vaniram: A. V., </em>“we have shot at them.” Our translators have regarded <span class="lang he-il">ניר</span>, the central syllable of this composite word, as the first future plural of <span class="lang he-il">ירה</span><em>be shot or cast; </em>and <em>S. M. </em>has noticed this explanation as more probably right than the one which he has adopted in his text, and which supposes <span class="lang he-il">ניר</span> to be a substantive, namely, a <em>lantern. </em>The Chaldee Paraphrast and the <em>V. </em>have regarded this substantive as a metaphor for the ruling power. If it had been a substantive, its place, in ordinary construction, should have been after the verb <span class="lang he-il">אבד</span><em>perished, </em>whereas it precedes that verb, which has Heshbon following it, in the proper position for its nominative. — <em>W </em></p><p><strong>(134)</strong> “Elle comprend les biens, l’honneur, le repos, et la reputation;” it comprehends goods, honor, repose, and reputation. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
