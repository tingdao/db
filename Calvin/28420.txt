<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>As a wise master-builder </em>It is a most apt similitude, and accordingly it is frequently met with in the Scriptures, as we shall see ere long. Here, however, the Apostle declares his fidelity with great confidence and fearlessness, as it required to be asserted in opposition not merely to the calumnies of the wicked, but also to the pride of the Corinthians, who had already begun to despise his doctrine. The more, therefore, they lowered him, so much the higher does he raise himself up, and speaking as it were from a pulpit of vast height, he declares <span class="cite-ref">(171)</span> that he had been the first <em>master-builder </em>of God among them in laying the foundation, and that he had with <em>wisdom </em>executed that department of duty, and that it remained that others should go forward in the same manner, regulating the superstructure in conformity with the rule of the foundation. Let us observe that these things are said by Paul <em>first </em>of all for the purpose of commending his doctrine, which he saw was despised by the Corinthians; and, <em>secondly</em>, for the purpose of repressing the insolence of others, who from a desire for distinction, affected a new method of teaching. These he accordingly admonishes to attempt nothing rashly in God’s building. Two things he prohibits them from doing: they must not venture to lay another foundation, and they must not raise a superstructure that will not be answerable to the foundation. </p><p><em>According to the grace </em>He always takes diligent heed not to usurp to himself a single particle of the glory that belongs to God, for he refers all thing’s to God, and leaves nothing to himself, except his having been an instrument. While, however, he thus submits himself humbly to God, he indirectly reproves the arrogance of those who thought nothing of throwing <em>the grace of God </em>into the shade, <span class="cite-ref">(172)</span> provided only they were themselves held in estimation. He hints, too, that there was nothing of the <em>grace </em>of the Spirit in that empty show, for which they were held in esteem, while on the other hand he clears himself from contempt, on the ground of his having been under divine influence. <span class="cite-ref">(173)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(171)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">I1 leur fait assavoir, et declare fort et ferme</span> :” — “He gives them to know, and declares strongly and firmly.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(172)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne faisoyent point de conscience d’amoindrir ou offusquer la grace de Dieu</span>;” — “Made no scruple of disparaging or obscuring the grace of God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(173)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Monstrant, quant a luy qu’il a este pousse et conduit de Dieu, il se defend et maintient contre tout mepris</span>;” — “Showing, as to himself, that he had been led on and conducted by God, he guards and defends himself against all contempt.” </p></div></div>
