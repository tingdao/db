<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Thy sons have fainted. </em>He describes more fully the lamentable and wretched condition of the Church, when he says that her children he prostrate. A mother cannot be visited with any grief more bitter than to have her children slain before her eyes, and not one or two of them, but so great a number as to fill the roads with the slaughter. </p><p><em>As a wild bull in a net. </em>The metaphor is taken from bears or other savage animals, by which he means that even the strongest of them have, as it were, been caught in snares. </p><p><em>Full of the indignation of Jehovah. </em>By this expression he distinctly states that none of these events are accidental, lest they should suppose that any of them has happened by chance, or lest they should accuse the Lord of cruelty for having punished them severely; because his judgment is just and righteous. This is what he means, when he says that this punishment has proceeded from <em>the rebuke </em>of the Lord. Yet we must bear in mind his object which I have already mentioned, that believers ought not to throw away the hope of grace, though innumerable calamities prompt and urge them to despair. </p></div>
