Nor does he follow the order of the events observed in the history; for he contents himself with showing, that the deliverance of the chosen people was the work of God. He again distinguishes between the power of God, and the ministry of Moses and Aaron. He indeed asserts that these men performed <em>miracles, </em>but these miracles proceeded from God, so that celestial power was not obscurely displayed by their instrumentality. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(223)</span> “<em>The words of his signs, </em>— <em>i.e., </em>declarations; which were afterwards confirmed by miracles.” — <em>Cresswell. </em>“In this phrase,” says Hammond, “<em>the words of his signs </em>or <em>prodigies, </em><span class="lang he-il">דברי</span>,<em>words, </em>seems to be somewhat more than a pleonasm. God had told them what signs they should use, to convince the people first, and then Pharaoh, of their mission; and so in each judgment God commands, and they show the sign; and God’s thus telling or speaking to them is, properly, <span class="lang he-il">דברי</span>, <em>words, </em>and the matter of these words expressed by <span class="lang he-il">אתותיו</span>, <em>signs </em>or <em>prodigies of his, </em>— viz., which as he directed, he would also enable them to do among them.” </p></div></div>
