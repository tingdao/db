<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet describes the felicity which shall be under the reign of Christ: and we know that whenever the Prophets set forth promises of a happy and prosperous state to God’s people, they adopt metaphorical expressions, and say, that abundance of all good things shall flow, that there shall be the most fruitful produce, that provisions shall be bountifully supplied; for they accommodated their mode of speaking to the notions of that ancient people; it is therefore no wonders if they sometimes speak to them as to children. At the same time, the Spirit under these figurative expressions declares, that the kingdom of Christ shall in every way be happy and blessed, or that the Church of God, which means the same thing, shall be blessed, when Christ shall begin to reign. </p><p>Hence he says, <em>Coming are the days, saith Jehovah, and the plowman shall draw nigh, </em>or <em>meet</em>, <em>the reaper </em>The Prophet no doubt refers to the blessing mentioned by Moses in <span class="bvs">Lev_26:5</span> for the Prophets borrowed thence their mode of speaking, to add more credit and authority to what they taught. And Moses uses nearly the same words, — that the vintage shall meet the harvest, and also that sowing shall meet the plowing: and this is the case, when God supplies abundance of corn and wine, and when the season is pleasant and favorable. We then see what the Prophet means, that is, that God would so bless his people, that he would suffer no lack of good things. </p><p><em>The plowman then shall come nigh the reaper; and the treader of grapes, the bearer of seed. </em>When they shall finish the harvest, they shall begin to plow, for the season will be most favorable; and then when they shall complete their vintage, they shall sow. Thus the fruitfulness, as I have said, of all produce is mentioned. </p><p>The Prophet now speaks in a hyperbolical language, and says<em>, Mountains shall drop sweetness, and all the hills shall melt, </em>that is, <em>milk shall flow down</em>. We indeed know that this has never happened; but this manner of speaking is common and often occurs in Scripture. The sum of the whole is, that there will be no common or ordinary abundance of blessings, but what will exceed belief, and even the course of nature, as the very mountains shall as it were flow down.
