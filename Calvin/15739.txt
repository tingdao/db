<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>Afterwards they are lessened </em>Ere I enter upon the consideration of the truths contained in this verse, I must make some brief verbal observations. Some make the word <span class="lang he-il">עוצר</span><em>, otser, </em>to signify <em>tyranny, </em>and certainly <span class="lang he-il">עצר</span><em>, atsar, </em>does signify to <em>bear rule. </em>But since it is used metaphorically for <em>anguish, </em>it appears to me that this is the meaning which is most accordant with the tenor of the passage. The last two words of the verse may be read as in the nominative case, as I have rendered them, or in the genitive, the <em>anguish of misery and sorrow </em>This lection appears to me preferable, <em>through the anguish of misery, </em><span class="cite-ref">(289)</span><em>and through sorrow. </em></p><p>We come now to notice shortly the main things in the passage. And as we had formerly a description of the changes which these districts underwent in relation to the nature of the soil, so now we are informed that mankind do not for ever continue in the same condition; because they both decrease in number, and lose their place and property by being reduced by wars or by civil commotions, or by other casualties. Therefore, whether they are wasted by the pestilence, or are defeated in battle, or are cut off by intestine broils, it is manifest that both their rank and condition undergo alteration. And what is the occasion of this change, but that God withdraws his grace, which hitherto formed the hidden spring from which all their prosperity issued? And as there are a thousand casualties by which cities may be ruined, the prophet brings forward one species of change of all others the most palpable and remarkable. And since God’s hand is not observed in that which relates to persons living in comparative obscurity, he brings into view princes themselves, whose name and fame will not permit any memorable event which befalls them to remain in obscurity. For it seems that the world is made on their account. When God, therefore, hurls them from their lofty estate, then men, aroused as it were from their slumber, are prepared to regard his judgments. Here, too, the mode of address which is employed must be attended to; in saying, that <em>God poured contempt upon princes, </em>it is as if it was his pleasure, so long as they retained their dignity, that honor and respect should be paid to them. The words of Daniel are well known, </p><p>“O king, God hath put the fear of thee in the very fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the earth,” (<span class="bvs">Dan_2:8</span>) </p><p>And assuredly, though princes may clothe themselves with power, yet that inward honor and majesty which God has conferred upon them, is a greater safeguard than any human arm. Nor even would a single village hold out for the space of three days, did not God, by his invisible and invincible agency, put a restraint upon the hearts of men. Hence, whenever God renders princes contemptible, their magnificent power must of necessity be subverted. This is a fact corroborated by history, that mighty potentates, who have been the terror and dread of the whole world, when once denuded of their dignity and power, have become the sport even of their own dependants. And inasmuch as such a striking revolution as this should be regarded as a wonderful display of God’s power, yet such is the obtuseness of our minds, that we will not acknowledge his overruling providence. As a contrast to these reverses, the prophet afterwards shows, that the poor and ignoble are exalted, and their houses increased, and that those who were held in no estimation, suddenly increase in wealth and power. In these things men would assuredly recognize the providence of God, were it not that the perversity of their minds rendered them insensate. </p><p><strong>(289)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par angoisse de mal et par douleur</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
