<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Naphtali</em>. Some think that in the tribe of Naphtali fleetness is commended; I rather approve another meaning, namely, that it will guard and defend itself by eloquence and suavity of words, rather than by force of arms. It is, however, no despicable virtue to soothe ferocious minds, and to appease excited anger, by bland and gentle discourse; or if any offense has been stirred up, to allay it by a similar artifice. He therefore assigns this praise to the sons of Naphtali, that they shall rather study to fortify themselves by humanity, by sweet words, and by the arts of peace, then by the defense of arms. He compares them to a hind let loose, which having been taken in hunting, is not put to death, but is rather cherished with delicacies. <span class="cite-ref">(213)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(213)</span> As the word <span class="lang he-il">אילה</span>, rendered hind, sometimes means a tree, it is supposed by some, that it should be so translated here. <em>Bochart </em>suggests this translation: </p><p>“Naphtali is a spreading oak, <LineBreak />Producing beautiful branches.” </p><p><em>Dr. A. Clarke </em>strenuously defends this version, and says, “perhaps no man who understands the genius of the Hebrew language will attempt to dispute its propriety.” Yet perhaps the received translation is not to be so easily disposed of. It may be granted that <em>Bochart’s </em>figure is more beautiful; but it will be difficult to show that his translation is equally literal and correct. <em>Caunter </em>suggests another rendering: </p><p><em>“Naphtali is a deer roaming at liberty, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>He shooteth forth noble branches,” </em>—<em>or antlers. </em></p><p>— <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
