<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>He died once to sin, etc. </em>What he had said — that we, according to the example of Christ, are for ever freed from the yoke of death, he now applies to his present purpose, and that is this — that we are no more subject to the tyranny of sin, and this he proves from the designed object of Christ’s death; for he died that he might destroy sin. </p><p>But we must observe what is suitable to Christ in this form of expression; for he is not said to die to sin, so as to cease from it, as the words must be taken when applied to us, but that he underwent death on account of sin, that having made himself <span class="lang el-gr">ἀντίλυτρον</span>, a ransom, he might annihilate the power and dominion of sin. <span class="cite-ref">(190)</span> And he says that he died <em>once</em>, not only because he has by having obtained eternal redemption by one offering, and by having made an expiation for sin by his blood, sanctified the faithful for ever; but also in order that a mutual likeness may exist between us. For though spiritual death makes continual advances in us, we are yet said properly to die only once, that is, when Christ, reconciling us by his blood to the Father, regenerates us at the same time by the power of his Spirit. </p><p><em>But that he lives</em>, <em>etc. </em>Whether you add<em>with </em>or <em>in </em>God, it comes to the same meaning; for he shows that Christ lives a life subject to no mortality in the immortal and incorruptible kingdom of God; a type of which ought to appear in the regeneration of the godly. We must here remember the particle of likeness, <em>so</em>; for he says not that we shall now live in heaven, as Christ lives there; but he makes the new life, which after regeneration we live on earth, similar to his celestial life. When he says that we ought to <em>die to sin</em>, according to his example, we are not to suppose it to be the same kind of death; for we die to sin, when sin dies in us, but it was otherwise with Christ; by dying it was that he conquered sin. But he had just said before, that we believe that we shall have life in common with him, he fully shows by the word <em>believing </em>that he speaks of the grace of Christ: for if he only reminded us of a duty, his mode of speaking would have been this, “Since we die with Christ, we ought also to live with him.” But the word believing denotes that he treats here of doctrine which is based on the promises; as though he had said, that the faithful ought to feel assured that they are through the kindness of Christ dead as to the flesh, and that the same Christ will preserve them in newness of life to the end. But the future time of the verb <em>live</em>, refers not to the last resurrection, but simply denotes the continued course of a new life, as long as we peregrinate on the earth. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(190)</span> This difference may be gathered from the general tenor of the whole passage; for his death and our death are said to have a <em>likeness</em>, and not to be same. And farther, in mentioning our death in this connection, in the next verse, he changes his phraseology; it is<span class="lang el-gr">νεκροὺς </span> and not <span class="lang el-gr">εἶναι, </span> which means those deprived of life — the lifeless. “The dead (<span class="lang el-gr">νεκροὺς</span>) in trespasses and sins,” are those who have no spiritual life; and to be dead <em>to </em>sin is not to have life for sin, to be freed from its ruling power. See <span class="bvs">Rom_6:18</span></p><p>It is usual with the Apostle to adopt the same form of words in different senses, which can only be distinguished by the context or by other parts of Scripture, as it has been noticed in a note on <span class="bvs">Rom_4:25</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
