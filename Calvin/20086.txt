<div class="comment-content"><p>Here Jeremiah uses another figure, that the weeping would be everywhere heard in the ascent to Luhith. It is probable, and it appears from the Prophet’s words, that this city was situated on a high place. He then says, that men would go up with weeping <em>in the ascent to Luhith</em>; literally, In (or with) <em>weeping shall weeping ascend </em>But some read as though it were written <span class="lang he-il">בכה</span>, <em>beke</em>, weeping; nor is there a doubt but that the verb <span class="lang he-il">יעלה</span>, <em>iole</em>, refers to a person. But Jeremiah seems to have mentioned weeping twice in order to show that men would not only weep in one place, but during the long course of their ascent, as though he had said, “They who shall be near the city shall weep, and they in the middle of their course, and those at the foot of the mountain;” that is, there shall be weeping in every place. We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet. </p><p>He afterwards says, <em>In the descent to Horonaim </em>It hence appears that this city was situated in a low place or on a plain; and therefore I know not why they say that one part of it was higher than the other. It might indeed be that it had a hill in it; but the place was in a level country, and had mountains around it, as we learn from the Prophet’s words, <em>In the descent to Horonaim the enemies shall hear a cry of distress </em>By saying that enemies would hear a cry, <span class="cite-ref">(6)</span> he means that the citizens of Horonaim and their neighbors would become frantic through grief. For fear restrains weeping, and when any one sees an enemy near, the very sight of him checks him, so that he dares not openly to show his grief; and then shame also restrains tears as well as sighings, for an enemy would deride our weepings in our misery. There is no doubt then, but that the Prophet here amplifies the grievousness of their sorrow, when he says, that though the citizens of Horonaim had enemies before their eyes, they would yet break forth with weeping and loud crying, and that the reproach and derision of enemies would not restrain them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(6)</span> The word <em>enemies </em>is given only by the <em>Vulg.; </em>the other versions render it “distress.” The literal rendering of the verse is, — </p><p>For <em>in </em>the ascent to Luhith, <LineBreak />With weeping ascends weeping; <LineBreak />For in the descent to Heronaim, <LineBreak />The distress of the cry of ruin have they heard. </p><p>This version materially corresponds with <span class="bvs">Isa_15:5</span>. Weeping ascending with weeping, shews that all wept as they ascended. “The distress of the cry” is a Hebraism for distressing cry — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
