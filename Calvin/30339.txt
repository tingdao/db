<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>Ye lust, </em>or <em>covet, and have not</em>. He seems to intimate that the soul of man is insatiable, when he indulges wicked lusts; and truly it is so; for he who suffers his sinful propensities to rule uncontrolled, will know no end to his lust. Were even the world given to him, he would wish other worlds to be created for him. It thus happens, that men seek torments which exceed the cruelty of all executioners. For that saying of Horace is true: </p><p>The tyrants of Sicily found no torment greater than envy. <span class="cite-ref">(129)</span></p><p>Some copies have <span class="lang el-gr">φονεύετε</span>, “ye kill;” but I doubt not but that we ought to read, <span class="lang el-gr">φθονεῖτε</span>, “ye envy,” as I have rendered it; for the verb, to kill, does in no way suit the context. <span class="cite-ref">(130)</span><em>Ye fight</em>: he does not mean those wars and fightings, which men engage in with drawn swords, but the violent contentions which prevailed among them. They derived no benefit from contentions of this kind, for he affirms that they received the punishment of their own wickedness. God, indeed, whom they owned not as the author of blessings, justly disappointed them. For when they contended in ways so unlawful, they sought to be enriched through the favor of Satan rather than through the favor of God. One by fraud, another by violence, one by calumnies, and all by some evil or wicked arts, strove for happiness. They then sought to be happy, but not through God. It was therefore no wonder that they were frustrated in their efforts, since no success can be expected except through the blessings of God alone. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(129)</span>Invidia Siculi non invenere tyranni Majus tormentum. — EPIST. Lib. I. 2:58. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(130)</span> There is no MS. nor version in favor of <span class="lang el-gr">φθονεῖτε</span>. When it is said, “ye kill,” the meaning is, that they did so as to the hatred or envy they entertained, for hatred is the root of murder, and arises often from envy. What has evidently led <em>Calvin </em>and others to conjecture a mistake here, has been the difficulty arising from the order of the words, “Ye kill and ye envy;” but this order is wholly consonant with the style of Scripture, where often the greater evil or good is mentioned first, and then that which precedes or leads to it. It is the same here as though the copulative, <em>and</em>, were rendered causatively, “ye kill because ye envy.” Envy is murder in the sight of God. </p><p>The language of the whole passage is highly metaphorical. He calls their contentions “wars and fightings;” for the whole tenor of the passage is opposed to the supposition that he refers to actual wars. He adopts a military term as to inward lusts or ambitious desires, that they “carried on war” in their members; the expedition for their contests was prepared within, mustered in their hearts. Then the character of this war is more plainly defined, “Ye covet,” not, ye lust; “ye kill,” or commit murder, for “ye envy;” when ye cannot attain your objects, “ye wage war and fight,” that is, ye wrangle and quarrel. Avarice and ambition were the two prevailing evils, but especially avarice; and avarice too for the purpose of gratifying the lusts and propensities of their sinful nature, as it appears from the third verse. </p></div></div>
