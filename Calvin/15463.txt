<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Harden not your heart, as in Meribah </em>The Psalmist, having extolled and commended the kindness of God their Shepherd, takes occasion, as they were stiffnecked and disobedient, to remind them of their duty, as his flock, which was to yield a pliable and meek submission; and the more to impress their minds, he upbraids them with the obstinacy of their fathers. The term <span class="lang he-il">מריבה</span><em>, Meribah, </em>may be used appellatively to mean <em>strife </em>or <em>contention; </em>but as the Psalmist evidently refers to the history contained in <span class="bvs">Exo_17:2</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(58)</span> I have preferred understanding it of the place — and so of <span class="lang he-il">מסה</span><em>, Massah. </em><span class="cite-ref">(59)</span> In the second clause, however, the place where the temptation happened may be thought sufficiently described under the term <em>wilderness, </em>and should any read, <em>according to the day of temptation </em>(instead of <em>Massah</em>)<em>in the wilderness, </em>there can be no objection. Some would have it, that Massah and Meribah were two distinct places, but I see no ground to think so; and, in a matter of so little importance, we should not be too nice or curious. He enlarges in several expressions upon the hardness of heart evinced by the people, and, to produce the greater effect, introduces God himself as speaking. <span class="cite-ref">(60)</span> By hardness of heart, he no doubt means, any kind of contempt shown to the word of God, though there are many different kinds of it. We find that when proclaimed, it is heard by some in a cold and slighting manner; that some fastidiously put it away from them after they had received it; that others proudly reject it; while again there are men who openly vent their rage against it with despite and blasphemy. <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> The Psalmist, in the one term which he has employed, comprehends all these defaulters, the careless — the fastidious — such as deride the word, and such as are actuated in their opposition to it by frenzy and passion. Before the heart can be judged soft and pliable to the hearing of God’s word, it is necessary that we receive it with reverence, and with a disposition to obey it. If it carry no authority and weight with it, we show that we regard him as no more than a mere man like ourselves; and here lies the hardness of our hearts, whatever may be the cause of it, whether simply carelessness, or pride, or rebellion. He has intentionally singled out the odious term here employed, to let us know what an execrable thing contempt of God’s word is; as, in the Law, <em>adultery </em>is used to denote all kinds of fornication and uncleanness, and <em>murder </em>all kinds of violence, and injury, hatreds, and enmities. Accordingly, the man who simply treats the word of God with neglect, and fails to obey it, is said here to have a hard and stony heart, although he may not be an open despiser. The attempt is ridiculous which the Papists have made to found upon this passage their favorite doctrine of the liberty of the will. We are to notice, in the first place, that all men’s hearts are naturally hard and stony; for Scripture does not speak of this as a disease peculiar to a few, but characteristic in general of all mankind, (<span class="bvs">Eze_36:26</span>.) It is an inbred pravity; still it is voluntary; we are not insensible in the same manner that stones are, <span class="cite-ref">(62)</span> and the man who will not suffer himself to be ruled by God’s word, makes that heart, which was hard before, harder still, and is convinced as to his own sense and feeling of obstinacy. The consequence by no means follows from this, that softness of heart — a heart flexible indifferently in either direction, is at our command. <span class="cite-ref">(63)</span> The will of man, through natural corruption, is wholly bent to evil; or, to speak more properly, is carried headlong into the commission of it. And yet every man, who disobeys God therein, hardens himself; for the blame of his wrong doing rests with none but himself. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(58)</span> This remarkable part of Jewish history is alluded to in other places, and for various purposes. Sometimes to reproach the Israelites on account of their sins, as in <span class="bvs">Deu_9:22</span>, “And at Massah ye provoked the Lord to wrath;” sometimes to warn them against falling into the like sins, as in <span class="bvs">Deu_6:16</span>, “Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God as ye tempted him in Massah;” and, at other times, as an instance of the faithfulness of the Levites who clave to God in these circumstances of trial, <span class="bvs">Deu_33:8</span>, “And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(59)</span> In our English Bible it is, “in the provocation — in the day of temptation.” But the most eminent critics agree with Calvin in thinking that it is better to retain the terms <em>Meribah </em>and <em>Massah </em>than to translate them. The places called by these names were so designated from the Israelites provoking and tempting God at them; and the retaining of the proper names gives more effect and liveliness to the allusion. See <span class="bvs">Psa_81:7</span>, volume 3, page 316, n. 2. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(60)</span> Mant and Walford suppose that it is at the second part of verse 7, “To-day, if ye will hear his voice,” where God is introduced as speaking. “By an almost imperceptible transition,” remarks the former critic, “the person is here [last clause of verse 7<span class="cite-ref">th</span>] changed; Jehovah becomes the speaker; and with a corresponding change of topic, the Ode, which had commenced with a spiritual exhortation to exult in the blessings of the Gospel, concludes with a solemn, affectionate, and impressive admonition of the danger of disobedience to it; leaving the warning upon the mind with an abruptness peculiarly well calculated to excite attention and to produce the desired effect.” Dimock conjectures, that, as God is introduced as speaking in the last clause of the 7<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, we should read with Mudge, <span class="lang he-il">בקולי</span>, for <span class="lang he-il">בקלו</span>, (or, as 37 MSS. and two others at first, <span class="lang he-il">בקולו</span>,) “Oh that you may hear <em>my voice </em>this day: that you may not harden your hearts,” etc. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(61)</span> “Ab aliis frigide audiri, et contemptim; ab aliis fastidiose respui; ab aliis superbe rejici; ab aliis etiam furiose non sine probro et blasphemia proscindi.” — <em>Lat</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(62)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combien qu’une telle perversite nous soit naturelle, toutesfois pource qu’elle est volontaire, et que nous ne sommes pas insensibles comme les pierres</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(63)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ne s’ensuit pas neantmoins qu’il soit en nostre puissance d’amollir nostre coeur, ou de le flechir en l’une et l’autre part</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
