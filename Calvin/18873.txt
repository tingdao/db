<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>And I will tread down the peoples. </em>From the preceding statement he draws the conclusion, that God’s wrath is sufficiently powerful to destroy the wicked, without calling for the assistance of others; and he does so in order that the Jews may not be deterred from cherishing favorable hopes by the strength that is arrayed against them. </p><p><em>And will make them drunk. </em>The expression, “make drunk,” must here be taken in a different sense from what it formerly had in some passages. We have seen that sometimes we are made drunk, when God strikes us with fury or madness, (<span class="bvs">Isa_29:9</span>,) or with a spirit of giddiness, (<span class="bvs">Isa_19:14</span>,) or, in a word, “gives us up to a reprobate mind.” (<span class="bvs">Rom_1:28</span>.) But here it means nothing else than “to fill,” and to strike even to satiety, or, as we commonly say, (<em class="lang fr-fr">tout leur saoul </em>,) “to their heart’s content;” a metaphor which the prophets frequently employ. </p><p><em>And will cast down their strength to the earth</em>. That is, though they think that they are invincible, yet I will cast down and destroy them. The meaning may be thus summed up. “The Jews, when they are afflicted, must not call in question their salvation, as if God hated them, and must not be amazed at the chastisements which they endure, as if they happened by chance; for other nations, by whom they are now oppressed, shall be punished, there shall be a revolution of affairs, and they shall not escape who chant a triumph before the time. He produces as an example the Edomites, because they were nearer and better known than others, and were also the most injurious. </p></div>
