<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>And beginning at Moses. This </em>passage shows us in what manner Christ is made known to us through the Gospel. It is when light is thrown on the knowledge of him by the Law and the Prophets. For never was there a more able or skillful teacher of the Gospel than our Lord himself; and we see that he borrows from <em>the Law and the Prophets </em>the proof of his doctrine. If it be objected that he began with easy lessons, that the disciples might gradually dismiss <em>the Prophets, </em>and pass on to the perfect Gospel, this conjecture is easily refuted; for we shall afterwards find it stated, that all the apostles had <em>their understanding opened, </em>not to be wise without the assistance of the Law, but <em>to understand the Scriptures. </em>In order that Christ may be made known to us through the Gospel, it is therefore necessary that Moses and the Prophets should go before as guides, to show us the way. It is necessary to remind readers of this, that they may not lend an ear to fanatics, who, by suppressing <em>the Law and the Prophets, </em>wickedly mutilate the Gospel; as if God intended that any testimony which he has ever given respecting his Son should become useless. </p><p>In what manner we must apply to Christ those passages respecting him which are to be found in every part of <em>the Law and the Prophets, </em>we have not now leisure to explain. <span class="cite-ref">(315)</span> Let it suffice to state briefly, that there are good reasons why Christ is called <em>the end of the law, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_10:4</span>.) For however obscurely and at a distance Moses may exhibit Christ in shadows, rather than in a full portrait, (<span class="bvs">Heb_10:1</span>,) this, at least, is beyond dispute, that unless there be in the family of Abraham one exalted Head, under whom the people may be united in one body, the covenant which God made with the holy fathers will be nullified and revoked. Besides, since God commanded that the tabernacle and the ceremonies of the law should be adjusted to a heavenly pattern, (<span class="bvs">Exo_25:40</span>; <span class="bvs">Heb_8:5</span>,) it follows that the sacrifices and the other parts of the service of the temple, if the reality of them is to be found nowhere else, would be an idle and useless sport. <span class="cite-ref">(316)</span> This very argument is copiously illustrated by the apostle, (<span class="bvs">Heb_9:1</span>;) <em>for, </em>assuming this principle, that the visible ceremonies of the law are shadows of spiritual things, he shows that in the whole of the legal priesthood, in the sacrifices, and in the form of the sanctuary, we ought to seek Christ. </p><p><em>Bucer, </em>too, somewhere throws out a judicious conjecture, that, amidst this obscurity, the Jews were accustomed to pursue a certain method of interpreting Scripture which had been handed down to them by tradition from the fathers. But that I may not involve my inquiries in any uncertainty, I shall satisfy myself with that natural and simple method which is found universally in all the prophets, who were eminently skilled in the exposition of the Law. From the Law, therefore, we may properly learn Christ, if we consider that the covenant which God made with the fathers was founded on the Mediator; that the sanctuary, by which God manifested the presence of his grace, was consecrated by his blood; that the Law itself, with its promises, was sanctioned by the shedding of blood; that a single priest was chosen out of the whole people, to appear in the presence of God, in the name of all, not as an ordinary mortal, but clothed in sacred garments; and that no hope of reconciliation with God was held out to men but through the offering of sacrifice. Besides, there is a remarkable prediction, that the kingdom would be perpetuated in <em>the tribe of Judah, </em>(<span class="bvs">Gen_49:10</span>.) The prophets themselves, as we have hinted, drew far more striking portraits of the Mediator, though they had derived their earliest acquaintance with him from Moses; for no other office was assigned to them than to renew the remembrance of the covenant, to point out more clearly the spiritual worship of God, to found on the Mediator the hope of salvation, and to show more clearly the method of reconciliation. Yet since it had pleased God to delay the full revelation till the coming of his Son, the interpretation of them was not superfluous. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(315)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Cela passeroit la mesure de ce present oeuvre</span>;” — “that would exceed the limits of the present work.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(316)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Un jeu d’enfans</span>;” — “a game for children.” </p></div></div>
