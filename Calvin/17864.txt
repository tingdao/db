<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>For he hath said, By the strength of my hand I have done it. </em>The Prophet again repeats the highly blasphemous words which the Assyrian uttered; for he ascribes to his <em>power </em>and <em>wisdom </em>all the victories which he obtained. By <em>strength of hand </em>he means vast armies collected out of various nations. Yet at the same time he boasts of being a warlike king, as those blusterers are wont to claim the praise of everything that was done under their direction, though they were enjoying the luxury and ease of a retired life. Afterwards he boasts that he was <em>cautious </em>and <em>wary</em>, to use an ordinary phrase of our own, (<em class="lang fr-fr">J’ay este bien entendu et expert </em>,) <em>I was very skillful and clever</em>. But there can be no doubt whatever that he bestows this honorable appellation on the tricks and dishonest cunning by which he had gained advantage over his neighbors. For what are the stratagems of kings and princes? To disturb the peace by indirect methods, to invent pretences for quarrels, to sow the seeds of discord, and, in a word, by their artifices to level all distinctions. </p><p><em>I have removed the boundaries of the nations. </em>This means, “I have extended the boundaries of my dominion, and have added other countries to my territories, so as to <em>remove their boundary </em>and limit.” Just as if we were to say that the King of France <em>removed the boundaries </em>of Brittany, Burgundy, Aquitaine, Provence, and other countries, when he united them to his own kingdom. He likewise adds, “that nothing was so secret or concealed as not to become his prey;” as if he had said that by his sagacity he drew the neighboring countries into his nets, fished their treasures, and brought into his possession all that lay concealed. </p></div>
