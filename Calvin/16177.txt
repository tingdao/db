<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Praise ye the name of Jehovah </em>Though this Psalm begins almost in the same manner with the preceding, the Psalmist would not appear to be addressing the Levites exclusively, but the people generally, since the reasons given for praising God are equally applicable to all God’s children. No mention is made of night watching, or of their standing constantly in the Temple. But indeed, as it was the special duty of the priests to take the lead in this devotional exercise, to give out, if we might use such an expression, and sing the praises of God before the people, there is no reason why we should not suppose that they are primarily addressed, and stirred up to their duty. We need only to examine the words more closely in order to be convinced that the people are included as next in order to the priests. <span class="cite-ref">(156)</span> For the Psalmist addresses the servants of God who <em>stand in the temple, </em>then those who are <em>in the courts, </em>whereas no notice was taken of the courts in the former Psalm. Mention seems to be made of <em>courts </em>in the plural number, because the priests had their court; and then there was another common to all the people, for by the law spoken of, (<span class="bvs">Lev_16:17</span>,) they were prohibited from entering the sanctuary. To prevent any feeling of disgust which might arise from the very frequent repetition of this exhortation to the praises of God, it is only necessary to remember, as was already observed, that there is no sacrifice in which he takes greater delight than the expression of our gratitude. Thus, (<span class="bvs">Psa_50:14</span>,) </p><p>“Sacrifice unto the Lord thanksgiving, <LineBreak />and pay your vows to the Most High;” </p><p>and, (<span class="bvs">Psa_116:12</span>,) </p><p>“What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.” </p><p>Particular attention is to be paid to those passages of Scripture which speak in such high terms of that worship of God which is spiritual; otherwise we may be led, in the exercise of a misguided zeal, to spend our labor upon trifles, and in this respect imitate the example of too many who have wearied themselves with ridiculous attempts to invent additions to the service of God, while they have neglected what is of all other things most important. This is the reason why the Holy Spirit so repeatedly inculcates the duty of praise. It is that we may not undervalue, or grow careless in this devotional exercise. It implies, too, an indirect censure of our tardiness in proceeding to the duty, for he would not reiterate the admonition were we ready and active in the discharge of it. The expression in the end of the verse — <em>because it is sweet, </em>admits of two meanings — that the name of God is sweet, as in the previous clause it was said that God is good — or, that it is a sweet and pleasant thing to sing God’s praises. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">נעים</span><em>naim, </em>properly signifies <em>beautiful </em>or <em>comely, </em>and this general signification answers best. <span class="cite-ref">(157)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(156)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et quand on advisera de bien pres aux mots, on y trouvera que le peuple est adjoint</span>, etc.”—<em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(157)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Signifie proprement chose bien seante ou belle: et ce sens general convient mieux</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
