<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>For if I do this thing willingly </em>By <em>reward </em>here is meant what the Latins term <em>operae pretium </em>, recompense for labor, <span class="cite-ref">(495)</span> and what he had previously termed <em>glorying </em>Others, however, interpret it otherwise — as meaning that a <em>reward </em>is set before all who discharge their duty faithfully and heartily. But, for my part, I understand the man who <em>does this thing willingly, </em>to be the man who acts with such cheerfulness, that, being intent upon edifying, as his one object of desire, he declines nothing that he knows will be profitable to the Church; as, on the other hand, he terms those <em>unwilling</em>, who in their actings submit, indeed, to necessity, but act grudgingly, because it is not from inclination. For it always happens that the man who undertakes any business with zeal, is also prepared of his own accord to submit to everything, which, if left undone, would hinder the accomplishment of the work. Thus Paul, being one that acted <em>willingly</em>, did not teach in a mere perfunctory manner, but left nothing undone that he knew to be fitted to promote and further his doctrine. <em>This </em>then was his <em>recompense for labor</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(496)</span> and <em>this </em>his ground of g<em>lorying </em>— that he did with readiness of mind forego his right in respect of his applying himself to the discharge of his office willingly and with fervent zeal. </p><p><em>But if unwillingly, a dispensation is committed to me. </em>In whatever way others explain these words, the natural meaning, in my opinion, is this — that God does not by any means approve of the service done by the man who performs it grudgingly, and, as it were, with a reluctant mind. Whenever, therefore, God has enjoined anything upon us, we are mistaken, if we think that we have discharged it aright, when we perform it <em>grudgingly</em>; for the Lord requires that his servants be <em>cheerful</em>, (<span class="bvs">2Co_9:7</span>,) so as to delight in obeying him, and manifest their cheerfulness by the promptitude with which they act. In short, Paul means, that he would act in accordance with his calling, only in the event of his performing his duty willingly and cheerfully. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(495)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce que nous appelons chef-d’oeuvre</span>;” — “What we call a masterpiece.” The idiomatic phrase, <em>operae pretium </em>, is ordinarily employed by the classical writers to mean — something <em>of importance</em>, or <em>worthwhile</em>. Thus <em>Livy</em>, in his Preface, says: “facturusne operae pretium sim;” — “whether I am about to do a work of importance,” and <em>Cicero </em>(Cat. 4. 8) says: “Operae pretium est;” — “It is <em>worth while</em>. ” Calvin, however, seems to make use of the phrase here in a sense more nearly akin to its original and literal signification — <em>recompense for labor </em>— <em>what </em>amply rewarded the self-denial that he had exercised — consisting in the peculiar satisfaction afforded to his mind in reflecting on the part that he had acted. The term made use of by him in his French Translation — <em class="lang fr-fr">chef-d </em><span class="lang fr-fr">’</span><em class="lang fr-fr">oeuure </em> (<em>masterpiece</em>) corresponds with the Latin phrase <em>operae pretium </em> in this respect, that a<em>masterpiece </em>is a work, which the successful artist, or workman, sets a <em>value </em>upon, and in which he feels <em>satisfaction</em>, as <em>amply recompensing </em>the pains bestowed. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(496)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Son chef-d’oeuure</span>;” — “His masterpiece.” </p></div></div>
