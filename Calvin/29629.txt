<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>Having put on the breastplate</em>. He adds this, that he may the more effectually shake us out of our stupidity, for he calls us as it were to arms, that he may shew that it is not a time to sleep. It is true that he does not make use of the term <em>war; </em>but when he arms us with a <em>breastplate </em>and a <em>helmet</em>, he admonishes us that we must maintain a warfare. Whoever, therefore, is afraid of being surprised by the enemy, must keep awake, that he may be constantly on watch. As, therefore, he has exhorted to vigilance, on the ground that the doctrine of the gospel is like the light of day, so he now stirs us up by another argument — that we must wage war with our enemy. From this it follows, that idleness is too hazardous a thing. For we see that soldiers, though in other situations they may be intemperate, do nevertheless, when the enemy is near, from fear of destruction, refrain from gluttony <span class="cite-ref">(596)</span> and all bodily delights, and are diligently on watch so as to be upon their guard. As, therefore, Satan is on the alert against us, and tries a thousand schemes, we ought at least to be not less diligent and watchful. <span class="cite-ref">(597)</span></p><p>It is, however, in vain, that some seek a more refined exposition of the names of the kinds of armor, for Paul speaks here in a different way from what he does in <span class="bvs">Eph_6:14</span> for there he makes <em>righteousness </em>the <em>breastplate</em>. This, therefore, will suffice for understanding his meaning, that he designs to teach, that the life of Christians is like a perpetual warfare, inasmuch as Satan does not cease to trouble and molest them. He would have us, therefore, be diligently prepared and on the alert for resistance: farther, he admonishes us that we have need of arms, because unless we be well armed we cannot withstand so powerful <span class="cite-ref">(598)</span> an enemy. He does not, however, enumerate <em>all the parts of armor</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">πανοπλίαν</span>,) but simply makes mention of two, the <em>breastplate </em>and the <em>helmet</em>. In the mean time, he omits nothing of what belongs to spiritual armor, for the man that is provided with <em>faith</em>, <em>love</em>, and <em>hope</em>, will be found in no department unarmed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(596)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et yurognerie</span>;” — “And drunkenness.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(597)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour le moins ne deuons—nous pas estre aussi vigilans que les gendarmes</span> ?” — “Should we not at least be as vigilant as soldiers are?” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(598)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si puissant et si fort</span>;” — “So powerful and so strong.” </p></div></div>
