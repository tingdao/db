<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>When we were come to Syracuse. </em>Luke prosecuteth the residue of the course of their sailing, that they arrived first in Sicilia. And after that they set a compass<span class="cite-ref">(668)</span> by reason of the tempest and raging of the sea, and sailed over into Italy. And as that haven whereof Luke speaketh in this place is the most famous haven of all Sicilia, so is it farther from the coast of Italy than is that of Messina, over against which is Rhegium, whereof he maketh mention. And it is in the country of the Brutians, as is Puteoli, a city of Campania. But forasmuch as the brethren kept Paul at Puteoli seven days, by this we gather how favorably and gently the centurion handled Paul. Neither do I doubt but that the holy man would have made him a faithful promise that he would always return in due time. But he was persuaded of his uprightness, so that he was not afraid that he would deceive him. And now we gather out of this place, that the seed of the gospel was then sown abroad, seeing there was some body of the Church even at Puteoli. </p><p><strong>(668)</strong></p><p>“ Oblique... trajecerint,” they made an indirect passage. </p></div>
