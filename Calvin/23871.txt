<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>44.</strong><em>And he who shall fall on this stone. </em>Christ confirms more fully the former statement, that he suffers no loss or diminution when he is rejected by the wicked, because, though their obstinacy were like a stone or like iron, yet by his own hardness he will break them, and therefore he will be the more highly glorified in their destruction. He perceived in the Jews an astonishing obstinacy, and therefore it was necessary that this kind of punishment should be described to them in an alarming manner, that they might not flatter themselves, while they thus dashed against him. This doctrine partly instructs us to give ourselves up gently, with a mild and tractable heart, to the dominion of Christ, and partly fortifies us against the obstinacy and furious attacks of the wicked, for whom there awaits a dreadful end. </p><p>Those persons are said to <em>fall upon </em>Christ, who rush forward to destroy him; not that they occupy a more elevated position than he does, but because their madness carries them so far, that they endeavor to attack Christ as if he were below them. But Christ tells them that all that they will gain by it is, that by the very conflict they will be <em>broken. </em>But when they have thus proudly exalted themselves, he tells them that another thing will happen, which is, that they will be <em>bruised </em>under the <em>stone, </em>against which they so insolently dashed themselves. </p></div>
