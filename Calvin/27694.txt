<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>And the city was moved. </em>We see in this place the vanity of the common people, which count Paul a condemned man before ever they hear him. Whereas the city is moved about godliness,<span class="cite-ref">(490)</span> “it is no marvel; but this is a point of perverse zeal and mad rashness, in that they set themselves against Paul before they know his matter. For in this corruption of nature frowardness is joined with foolishness, so that those will readily, of their own accord, make haste to maintain an evil cause who can hardly be moved with many exhortations to do well. This is a hard case, that the whole world should be armed against us at a sudden, through the persuasion of a few; but seeing it pleaseth the Lord it should be so, let every one of us prepare himself by this, and such like examples, to suffer all manner [of] assaults, and to bear and abide all brunts. </p><p><strong>(490)</strong></p><p>“ Quod tumultuatur civitas in negotio pietatis,” that the city is in a tumult in a matter relating to godliness. </p></div>
