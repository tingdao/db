<div class="comment-content"><p>He confirms, as I have said, what he had declared in the last verse, tie had said, that there would be the ruin of the whole people: for the same purpose he now adds, <em>Destroying I will destroy them </em>The verb <span class="lang he-il">אסף</span>, <em>asaph, </em>properly means “to collect, “but metaphorically, “to destroy;” as we say in our language, <em>Trousser; Je les trousserai tous ensemble. </em>And hence it more fully appears, that the Prophet explains what he had said, that destruction was nigh them all, so that none would remain, that is, with regard to the people as a body, as a community; for God ever preserved a remnant. We have, indeed, said elsewhere, and we shall have to notice the same thing often again, that the prophets, regarding the people as a body, threatened them all with destruction; but when they addressed the elect, and the faithful, they added a modification: <em>Destroying I will </em>then <em>destroy them </em></p><p>He afterwards shews the manner: No <em>grapes </em>shall be on <em>the vines, </em>and <em>no figs on the fig </em>—<em>trees </em>The word for “fig” means the fruit as well as the tree, as it is well known. And that he might more fully set forth God’s vengeance, he says, that the very leaves would wither. The meaning is, that God would soon come as an avenger, however securely the Jews might be resting in their sins: and he shews the kind of vengeance that awaited them, — that God would deprive them of all sustenance and support; by mentioning a part for the whole, he includes everything necessary for life. He speaks not of wine, and of corn, and of oil; but by figs and grapes, as I have said, he comprehends every kind of sustenance; and even the leaves would wither and fall. </p><p>In the second place, he adds, <em>Even, what I shall give them shall pass away from them </em>Some apply this to the fruit in the granaries and cellars, as though he had said, “Even if they should have provisions in their storehouses and cellars, and be furnished with plenty, all this shall yet avail them nothing, for it shall be all taken away; for to pass away has often this meaning; and the <span class="lang he-il">מ</span>, <em>mem</em>, affixed, is the same as though it was <span class="lang he-il">מהם</span>, <em>meem</em>, from them. Others render the words, “they shall pass over them;” but this is too strained. They refer to the precepts granted to the Jews, which they had rendered void or neglected: but this cannot suit the passage. And as to the first explanation, it seems to me too limited. I therefore take this to be the meaning, — “Even if the grapes and figs come to maturity, yet what they shall consider as already prepared shall be taken away.” The Prophet then means, that there would be various ways by which the Jews would be reduced to penury and want; for either the enemies would rob them of their grapes and figs, or he himself would send sterility; or, when they thought their provisions secured to them, they would not yet be allowed to enjoy them. This is the import of the whole. <span class="cite-ref">(227)</span> It follows — </p><p><strong>(227)</strong> The verse may be thus rendered, — </p><p><strong>13.</strong>I will gather their ingathering, saith Jehovah: No grapes <em>shall be </em>on the vine, And no figs on the fig-tree, Even the leaf <em>shalt </em>fade away; For I will give <em>these </em>to those <em>who </em>shall pass through them. </p><p>God threatens the Jews with the deprivation of the fruits of the earth. He would gather their fruits by means of their enemies, such as would pass through them; and there would be no limits for them. As to the last line, it is a common thing in Hebrew to leave out the relative “who” before a verb in the future tense. So it is in <em>Welsh </em>— </p><p>(lang. cy) Canys rhoddav y <em>rhain </em>iddynt hwy a dramwyant trwyddynt. </p><p>The most literal and the most suitable to the context is this rendering. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
