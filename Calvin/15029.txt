<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>They become insolent, and wickedly talk of extortion. </em>Some take the verb <span class="lang he-il">ימיקו</span>, <em>yamicu, </em>in an active transitive sense, and explain it as meaning, that the wicked soften, that is to say, render others pusillanimous, or frighten and intimidate them. <span class="cite-ref">(170)</span> But as the idiom of the language admits also of its being understood in the neuter sense, I have adopted the interpretation which agreed best with the scope of the passage, namely, that the wicked, forgetting themselves to be men, and by their unbounded audacity trampling under foot all shame and honesty, dissemble not their wickedness, but, on the contrary, loudly boast of their extortion. And, indeed, we see that wicked men, after having for some time got every thing to prosper according to their desires, cast off all sham and are at no pains to conceal themselves when about to commit iniquity, but loudly proclaim their own turpitude. “What!” they will say, “is it not in my power to deprive you of all that you possess, and even to cut your throat?” Robbers, it is true, can do the same thing; but then they hide themselves for fear. These giants, or rather inhuman monsters, of whom David speaks, on the contrary not only imagine that they are exempted from subjection to any law, but, unmindful of their own weakness, foam furiously, as if there were no distinction between good and evil, between right and wrong. If, however, the other interpretation should be preferred, That the wicked intimidate the simple and peaceable by boasting of the great oppressions and outrages which they can perpetrate upon them, I do not object to it. When the poor and the afflicted find themselves at the mercy of these wicked men, they cannot but tremble, and, so to speak, melt and dissolve upon seeing them in possession of so much power. With respect to the expression, <em>They speak from on high, </em><span class="cite-ref">(171)</span> implies, that they pour forth their insolent and abusive speech upon the heads of all others. As proud men, who disdain to look directly at any body, are said, in the Latin tongue, <em>despicere, </em>and in the Greek, <em>Katablepein, </em>that is, <em>to look down; </em><span class="cite-ref">(172)</span> so David introduces them as speaking from on high, because it seems to them that they have nothing in common with other men, but think themselves a distinct class of beings, and, as it were, little gods. <span class="cite-ref">(173)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(170)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Exposans que les meschans amolissent, c’est a dire, rendent lasches les autres, c’est a dire, les espouantent et intimident</span>.” — <em>Fr </em><span class="lang he-il">ימיקו</span>, <em>yamicu</em>, is rendered by Vatablus, Cocceius, Gejer, and Michaelis, “They cause to consume or melt away.” “They melt or dissolve others,” says Dr Gill, “they consume them, and waste their estates by their oppression and violence; they make their hearts to melt with their threatening and terrifying words; or they make them dissolute in their lives by keeping them company.” Mudge reads, “They behave corruptly;” and Horsley, “They are in the last stage of degeneracy.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(171)</span> The original word, <span class="lang he-il">ממרום</span>, <em>memmarom</em>, for<em>from on high</em>, is translated by our English version <em>loftily </em>But Musculus, Junius, Tremellius, Piscator, Mudge, Horsley, and others read with Calvin, <em>from on high They speak from on high</em>, “as if they were in heaven and above all creatures, and even God himself; and as if what they said were oracles, and to be received as such without any scruple and hesitation.
