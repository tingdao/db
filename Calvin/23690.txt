<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona. </em>As </p><p>this is life eternal, to know the only true God, <LineBreak />and him whom he hath sent, Jesus Christ, (<span class="bvs">Joh_17:3</span>,) </p><p>Christ justly pronounces him to be <em>blessed </em>who has honestly made such a confession. This was not spoken in a peculiar manner to Peter alone, but our Lordâ€™s purpose was, to show in what the only happiness of the whole world consists. That every one may approach him with greater courage, we must first learn that all are by nature miserable and accursed, till they find a remedy in Christ. Next, we must add, that whoever has obtained Christ wants nothing that is necessary to perfect happiness, since we have no right to desire any thing better than the eternal glory of God, of which Christ puts us in possession. </p><p><em>Flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee. </em>In the person of one man Christ reminds all that we must ask faith from the Father, and acknowledge it to the praise of his grace; for the special illumination of God is here contrasted with <em>flesh and blood. </em>Hence we infer, that the minds of men are destitute of that sagacity which is necessary for perceiving the mysteries of heavenly wisdom which are hidden in Christ; and even that all the senses of men are deficient in this respect, till God opens our eyes to perceive his glory in Christ. Let no man, therefore, in proud reliance on his own abilities, attempt to reach it, but let us humbly suffer ourselves to be inwardly taught by <em>the Father of Lights</em>, (<span class="bvs">Jas_1:17</span>,) that his Spirit alone may enlighten our darkness. And let those who have received faith, acknowledging the blindness which was natural to them, learn to render to God the glory that is due to Him. </p></div>
