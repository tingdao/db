<div class="comment-content"><p>Although God seems here to promise some mitigation of his wrath, there is no doubt that he expresses what we formerly saw, namely, that such should be the destruction of the nation that there would be no need to return again to punish them. When, therefore, he says<em>, I will make my indignation rest upon thee</em>, it means that he would satiate himself with vengeance for all their crimes: so that the consumption of the people is here called the rest of Godâ€™s indignation, as if he had said, When I have utterly reduced you to nothing, then my indignation against thee shall rest. In the same way he afterwards adds, <em>and my indignation shall depart from thee</em>. But I cannot finish today. </p></div>
