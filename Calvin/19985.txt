<div class="comment-content"><p>He then says that he faithfully related to them what God had commanded, <em>Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me </em>By this circumstance he shews that they were more bound to obey; for if God had sent his Prophet to them,’ they ought to have obeyed his voice; but when they of their own accord <em>came to </em>him and prayed for a favor, and wished God’s will to be made known to them, they became doubly culpable when they refused the answer given them in God’s name. And he adds, <em>That I might prostrate, </em>or make to fall, <em>your prayer before God </em>We have stated what is meant by this mode of speaking; but there is a difference to be noticed, for he had been requested sup-pliantly to ask God; and he says here that he had not only prayed, but had presented the prayer of the whole people, because he acted for the public; and then he was a middle person between God and the people. On this account he says, that he had been <em>seat </em>to present the prayer of the people to God, for he asked nothing for himself, but acted for them all, and asked God to answer the people. </p></div>
