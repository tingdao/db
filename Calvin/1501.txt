<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf</em>. Some of the Jews think the Benjamites are here condemned; because, when they had suffered lusts to prevail, like lawless robbers, among them, they were at length cut down and almost destroyed by a terrible slaughter, for having defiled the Leviteâ€™s wife. Others regard it as an honorable encomium, by which Saul, or Mordecai was adorned, who were both of the tribe of Benjamin. The interpreters of our own age most inaptly apply it to the apostle Paul, who was changed from a wolf into a preacher of the Gospel. Nothing seems to me more probable than that the disposition and habits of the whole tribe is here delineated; namely, that they would live by plunder. <em>In the morning they would seize and devour the prey, </em>in the evening they would divide the spoil; by which words he describes their diligence in plundering. </p></div>
