<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>Thou knowest that all that are in Asia have forsaken me </em>Those apostasies which he mentions might have shaken the hearts of many, and given rise, at the same time, to many suspicions; as we commonly look at everything in the worst light. Paul meets scandals of this kind with courage and heroism, that all good men may learn to abhor the treachery of those who had thus deserted the servant of Christ, when he alone, at the peril of his life, was upholding the common cause; and that they may not on that account give way, when they learn that Paul is not left destitute of divine assistance. </p><p><em>Of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes </em>He names two of them, who were probably more celebrated than the rest, that he may shut the door against their slanders; for it is customary with revolters and deserters from the Christian warfare, <span class="cite-ref">(151)</span> in order to excuse their own baseness, to forge as many accusations as they can against the good and faithful ministers of the gospel. “Phygellus and Hermogenes,” knowing that their cowardice was justly reckoned infamous by believers, and that they were even condemned as guilty of base treachery, would not have hesitated to load Paul with false accusations, and impudently to attack his innocence. Paul, therefore, in order to take away all credit from their lies, brands them with the mark which they deserve. </p><p>Thus also, in the present day, there are many who, because they are not here admitted into the ministry, or are stripped of the honor on account of their wickedness, <span class="cite-ref">(152)</span> or because we do not choose to support them while they do nothing, or because they have committed theft or fornication, are compelled to fly, and forthwith wander through France and other countries, and, by throwing upon us all the accusations <span class="cite-ref">(153)</span> that they can, borrow from them an attestation of their innocence. And some brethren are so silly as to accuse us of cruelty, if any of us paints such persons in their true colors. But it were to be wished that all of them had their forehead marked with a hot iron, that they might be recognized at first sight. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(151)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car c’est la coustume des apostats, et de ceux qui Laissent la vocation de Christ</span>.” — “For it is customary with apostates, and with those who forsake the calling of Christ.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(152)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pource qu’on les en depose a cause de leur mesehancete et vie scandaleuse</span>.” — “Because they are deposed on account of their wickedness and scandalous life.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(153)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tous les blasphemes et accusations qu’ils peuvent</span>.” — “All the blasphemies and accusations that they can.” </p></div></div>
