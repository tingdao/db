<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>You shall die in your sins. </em>Having formerly employed the singular number, <em>in your sin</em>, he now resorts to the plural number,<em>in your sins; </em>but the meaning is the same, except that in the former passage he intended to point out that unbelief is the source and cause of all evils. Not that there are no other sins but unbelief, <span class="cite-ref">(223)</span> or that it is unbelief alone which subjects us to the condemnation of eternal death before God, as some men too extravagantly talk; but because it drives us away from Christ, and deprives us of his grace, from which we ought to expect deliverance from all our sins. That the Jews reject the medicine with obstinate malice, is their mortal disease; and hence it arises that the slaves of Satan do not cease to heap up sins on sins, and continually to bring down upon themselves fresh condemnations. And, therefore, he immediately adds, — </p><p><em>If you do not believe that I am. </em>For there is no other way for lost men to recover salvation, but to betake themselves to Christ. The phrase, <em>that I am</em>, is emphatic; for, in order to make the meaning complete, we must supply all that the Scripture ascribes to the Messiah, and all that it bids us expect from him. But the sum and substance is — the restoration of the Church, the commencement of which is the light of faith, from which proceed righteousness and a new life. Some of the ancient writers have deduced from this passage the Divine essence of Christ; but that is a mistake, for he speaks of his office towards us. This statement is worthy of observation; for men never consider sufficiently the evils in which they are plunged; and though they are constrained to acknowledge their destruction, yet they neglect Christ, and look around them, in every direction, for useless remedies. Wherefore we ought to believe that, until the grace of Christ be manifested to deliver us, nothing but a boundless mass of all evils reigns perpetually in us. <span class="cite-ref">(224)</span></p><p><strong>(223)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Non pas qu’il n’y a point d’autres pechez que l’incredulite</span>.” </p><p><strong>(224)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’y a qu’un amas infini de tous maux qui regne continuellement en nous</span>.” </p></div>
