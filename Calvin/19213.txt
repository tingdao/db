He then required from those despised exiles an open and a bold confession, as though he had said, “Even though ye are now in the most miserable bondage, and though the Chaldeans disdainfully oppress you, as if ye were slaves, yet proclaim the glory of God and shrink not from an open confession of your religion, and say to them, in contempt of all their idols, <em>perish must your gods from the earth and from under heaven, for they have not made heaven nor the earth.” </em>We now understand the meaning of the Prophet. But the rest I shall defer until tomorrow. </p></div>
