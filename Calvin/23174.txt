<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Having assembled the priests </em>Though deep silence prevailed respecting Christ in the Hall of Herod, yet, as soon as the <em>Magi </em>have thrown out the mention of a <em>King, </em>predictions are remembered, which formerly lay in oblivion. Herod instantly conjectures, that the <em>King, </em>about whom the <em>Magi </em>inquire, is the <em>Messiah </em>whom God had formerly promised, (<span class="bvs">Dan_9:25</span>.) Here again it appears, that Herod is seriously alarmed, when he puts such earnest inquiries; and no wonder. All tyrants are cowards, and their cruelty produces stronger alarm in their own breasts than in the breasts of others. Herod must have trembled more than others, because he perceived that he was reigning in opposition to God. </p><p>This new investigation shows, that the contempt of Christ, before the arrival of the <em>Magi, </em>must have been very deep. At a later period, the scribes and high priests labored with fury to corrupt the whole of the Scripture, that they might not give any countenance to Christ. But on the present occasion they reply honestly out of the Scripture, and for this reason, that Christ and his Gospel have not yet given them uneasiness. And so all ungodly persons find no difficulty in giving their assent to God on general principles; but when the truth of God begins to press them more closely, they throw out the venom of their rebellion. </p><p>We have a striking instance of this, in our own day, among the Papists. They freely own, that he is the only-begotten Son of God, clothed with our flesh, and acknowledge the one person of God-man, as subsisting in the two natures. But when we come to the power and office of Christ, a contest immediately breaks out; because they will not consent to take a lower rank, and much less to be reduced to nothing. In a word, so long as wicked men think that it is taking nothing from themselves, they will yield to God and to Scripture some degree of reverence. But when Christ comes into close conflict with ambition, covetousness, pride, misplaced confidence, hypocrisy, and deceit, they immediately forget all modesty, and break out into rage. Let us therefore learn, that the chief cause of blindness in the enemies of truth is to be found in their wicked affections, which change light into darkness. </p></div>
