<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>That this also which is written must be accomplished in me. </em>This adverb <em>also </em>is emphatic; for Christ means, that he had not <em>yet </em>discharged every part of his office, till he had been ranked with ungodly and wicked men, as if he had been one of their class. But that their minds might not be too much disturbed by the baseness of such a transaction, he quotes a prediction of Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_53:12</span>) which, it is certain, cannot be explained but as referring to the Messiah. Now since it is there said that he was to be <em>reckoned among transgressors, </em>such a spectacle, however atrocious, ought not to alarm believers, or to alienate them from Christ, who could not have been their Redeemer in any other way than by taking upon himself the shame and disgrace of a wicked man. For nothing is better adapted to remove grounds of offense, when we are alarmed by any strange occurrence, than to acknowledge that it so pleases God, and that whatever takes place by his appointment is not done rashly, or without a good reason; more especially when that which is made evident by the event itself was anciently predicted. Since, then, the disciples ought to expect a Redeemer such as God had formerly promised, and since Isaiah had expressly declared, that in order that he might deliver us from the guilt of offenses the punishment must be <em>laid on him, </em>(<span class="bvs">Isa_53:5</span>,) this ought to be sufficient for abating the horror of the disciples, and for preventing them from entertaining less esteem for Christ. </p><p><em>For those things which relate to me have an end. </em>By these words, immediately added, he means that the prophets spoke nothing in vain. For this Greek phrase, <span class="lang el-gr">τέλος ἔχει</span>, <em>have an end; </em>means that they are accomplished, or put in effect. Now when every thing that the prophets spoke is verified by the event, it ought rather to contribute to strengthen our faith, than to strike us with alarm or anxiety. But while Christ encourages and comforts the disciples by this single argument, that all the predictions <em>must be accomplished, </em>the very procedure of the divine purpose contains within itself no ordinary ground of confidence, which is, that Christ was subjected to the condemnation which we deserved, and <em>was reconciled among transgressors, </em>that we, who are <em>transgressors, </em>and loaded with crimes, might be presented by him to the Father as righteous. For we are reckoned pure and free from sins before God, because the Lamb, who was pure and free from every blemish, was placed in our room, as we shah have occasion to state again under the next chapter. </p></div>
