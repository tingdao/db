<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>But followers, </em>or <em>imitators, etc. </em>To sloth he opposes imitation; it is then the same thing as though he said, that there was need of constant alacrity of mind; but it had far more weight, when he reminded them, that the fathers were not made partakers of the promises except through the unconquerable firmness of faith; for examples convey to us a more impressive idea of things. When a naked truth is set before us, it does not so much affect us, as when we see what is required of us fulfilled in the person of Abraham. But Abraham’s example is referred to, not because it is the only one, but because it is more illustrious than that of any other. For though Abraham had this faith in common with all the godly; yet it is not without reason that he is called the father of the faithful. It is, then, no wonder that the Apostle selected him from all the rest, and turned towards him the eyes of his readers as to the clearest mirror of faith. </p><p><em>Faith and patience, etc. </em>What is meant is, a firm faith, which has patience as its companion. For faith is what is, chiefly required; but as many who make at first a marvelous display of faith, soon fail, he shows, that the true evidence of that faith which is not fleeting and evanescent, is endurance. By saying that the <em>promises </em>were obtained by <em>faith, </em>he takes away the notion of merits; and still more clearly by saying, that they came by “inheritance”; for we are in no other way made heirs but by the right of adoption. <span class="cite-ref">(104)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(104)</span> The word for “patience” is properly long-suffering, or forbearance, <span class="bvs">Rom_2:4</span>; but it is used here in the same sense of patient expectation, as the participle clearly means in verse 15. </p><p>As to “inherit,” the present, as Grotius says, is used for the past tense — “who inherited,” or rather, “became heirs to the promises.” They did not really possess them, as we find in <span class="bvs">Heb_11:13</span>, but heired them, as we may say; they died in faith and became entitled to them. The word “promises” is used here as well as in chapter 11; for many things were included in what God had promised to the fathers, but chiefly the Messiah and the heavenly inheritance. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
