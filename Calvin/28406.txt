<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world </em>He heightens by contrast the certainty of which he had made mention. “The Spirit of revelation,” says he, “which we have received, is not of the world, so as to be merely creeping upon the ground, so as to be subject to vanity, or be in suspense, or vary or fluctuate, or hold us in doubt and perplexity. On the contrary, it is from God, and hence it is above all heavens, of solid and unvarying truth, and placed above all risk of doubt.” </p><p>It is a passage that is most abundantly clear, for refuting that diabolical doctrine of the Sophists as to a constant hesitancy on the part of believers. For they require all believers to be in doubt, whether they are in the grace of God or not, and allow of no assurance of salvation, but what hangs on moral or probable conjecture. In this, however, they overthrow faith in two respects: for <em>first </em>they would have us be in doubt, whether we are in a state of grace, and then afterwards they suggest a <em>second </em>occasion of doubt — as to final perseverance. <span class="cite-ref">(120)</span> Here, however, the Apostle declares in general terms, that the <em>elect </em>have the Spirit given them, by whose testimony they are assured that they have been adopted to the hope of eternal salvation. Undoubtedly, if they would maintain their doctrine, they must of necessity either take away the Spirit of God from the elect, or make even the Spirit himself subject to uncertainty. Both of these things are openly at variance with Paul’s doctrine. Hence we may know the nature of faith to be this, that conscience has from the Holy Spirit a sure testimony of the good-will of God towards it, so that, resting upon this, it does not hesitate to invoke God as a Father. Thus Paul lifts up our faith above the world, that it may look down with lofty disdain upon all the pride of the flesh; for otherwise it will be always timid and wavering, because we see how boldly human ingenuity exalts itself, the haughtiness of which requires to be trodden under foot by the sons of God through means of an opposing haughtiness of heroical magnanimity. <span class="cite-ref">(121)</span></p><p><em>That we may know the things that are given us by Christ. </em>The word <em>know </em>is made use of to express more fully the assurance of confidence. Let us observe, however, that it is not acquired in a natural way, and is not attained by the mental capacity, but depends entirely on the revelation of the Spirit. The things that he makes mention of as <em>given by Christ </em>are the blessings that we obtain through his death and resurrection — that being reconciled to God, and having obtained remission of sins, we know that we have been adopted to the hope of eternal life, and that, being sanctified by the Spirit of regeneration, we are made new creatures, that we may live to God. In <span class="bvs">Eph_1:18</span>, he says what amounts to the same thing — </p><p>“That ye may know what is the hope of your calling.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(120)</span> The reader will find this subject treated of at greater length in the <em>Institutes</em>, volume 2, p. 143. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(121)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Fondee en vne magnanimite heroique</span>;” — “Founded upon a heroical magnanimity.” </p></div></div>
