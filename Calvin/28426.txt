<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Know ye not</em>, <em>etc. </em>Having admonished the teachers as to their duty, he now addresses himself to the pupils — that they, too, may take heed to themselves. To the teachers he had said, “You are the master-builders of the house of God.” He now says to the people, “You are <em>the temples of God. </em>It is your part, therefore, to take care that you be not, in any way defiled.” Now, the design <span class="cite-ref">(190)</span> is, that they may not prostitute themselves to the service of men. He confers upon them distinguished honor in speaking thus, but it is in order that they may be made the more reprehensible; for, as God has set them apart as a <em>temple </em>to himself, he has at the same time appointed them to be guardians of his <em>temple </em>It is sacrilege, then, if they give themselves up to the service of men. He speaks of all of them collectively as being one <em>temple of God</em>; for every believer is a <em>living stone</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Pe_2:5</span>,) for the rearing up of the building of God. At the same time they also, in some cases, individually receive the name of <em>temples </em>We shall find him a little afterwards (<span class="bvs">1Co_6:19</span>) repeating the same sentiment, but for another purpose. For in that passage he treats of chastity; but here, on the other hand, he exhorts them to have their faith resting on the obedience of Christ alone. The interrogation gives additional emphasis; for he indirectly intimates, that he speaks to them of a thing that they knew, while he appeals to them as witnesses. </p><p><em>And the Spirit of God. </em>Here we have the reason why they are <em>the temple of God </em>Hence <em>and </em>must be understood as meaning <em>because </em><span class="cite-ref">(191)</span> This is customary, as in the words of the poet — “Thou hadst heard it, <em>and </em>it had been reported.” “For this reason,” says he, “are ye the <em>temples of God</em>, because He dwells in you by his Spirit; for no unclean place can be the habitation of God.” In this passage we have an explicit testimony for maintaining the divinity of the Holy Spirit. For if he were a creature, or merely a gift, he would not make us <em>temples of God</em>, by dwelling in us. At the same time we learn, in what manner God communicates himself to us, and by what tie we are bound to him — when he pours down upon us the influence of his Spirit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(190)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De cest aduertissement</span>;” — “Of this caution.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(191)</span> Audieras, <em>et </em>fama fitit.
