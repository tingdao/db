But it is easy to reconcile them. The Lord, perceiving that Mary was too eager to embrace and kiss his fleet, orders her to retire; because it was proper to correct the superstition, and to point out the design of his resurrection, which Mary was withheld from perceiving, partly by an earthly and carnal affection, and partly by foolish zeal. Yet at first the Lord permitted her to touch <em>his feet, </em>that nothing might be wanting to give her a full conviction; and, therefore, Matthew immediately adds, that <em>they worshipped the Lord, </em>which was a proof that they fully recognized him. </p></div>
