You must not then strive to please those to whom nothing is pleasing but evil. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(438)</span> The<span class="lang el-gr">γὰρ </span> in this verse is considered by [<span class="bvs">Griesbach </span>] as wholly spurious; and [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] has left it out. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
