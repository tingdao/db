<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>He who doth not take up his cross </em>From particular cases he proceeds to general views, and informs us that we cannot be reckoned his disciples unless we are prepared to endure many afflictions. If we are vexed and tormented by the thought, that the gospel should set us at variance with our father, or our wife, or our children, let us remember this condition, that Christ subjects all his disciples to <em>the cross </em>Yet let us also bear in mind this consolation, that, in <em>bearing the cross, </em>we are the companions of Christ, â€” which will speedily have the effect of allaying all its bitterness. The reprobates are not less firmly bound to their <em>cross, </em>and cannot with their most violent struggles shake it off; but as to those who are out of Christ the cross is accursed, a mournful end awaits them. Let us therefore learn to connect these two things, that believers must bear the cross in order to follow their Master; that is, in order to conform to his example, and to abide by his footsteps like faithful companions. </p></div>
