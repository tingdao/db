<div class="comment-content"><p>The translation of some, <em>Many say </em>OF <em>my soul, </em>does not give the true meaning of this passage. The letter <span class="lang he-il">ל</span> lamed is indeed sometimes used as meaning <em>of </em>in Hebrew, but David here intended to express something more, namely, that his heart was in a manner pierced with the mockery of his enemies. The word <em>soul, </em>therefore, in my opinion, here signifies the seat of the affections. And it has a corresponding meaning in a passage which we shall meet with in another Psalm, (<span class="bvs">Psa_35:3</span>,) “Say to my soul, I am thy salvation.” David thus teaches us by his own example, that although the whole world, with one voice, should attempt to drive us to despair, instead of listening to it, we ought rather to give ear to God alone, and always cherish within us the hope of the salvation which he hath promised; and as the ungodly use their endeavors to destroy our souls, we ought to defend them by our prayers. With respect to the word <em>Selah, </em>interpreters are not agreed. Some maintain it is a mark of affirmations and has the same signification as truly or amen. Others understand it as meaning <em>for ever. </em>But as <span class="lang he-il">סלל</span><em>Selal, </em>from which it is derived, signifies <em>to lift up, </em>we incline to the opinion of those who think it denotes the lifting up of the voice in harmony in the exercise of singing. At the same time, it must be observed, that the music was adapted to the sentiment, and so the harmony was in unison with the character or subject-matter of the song; just as David here, after having complained of his enemies for shamefully laughing to scorn his hope, as if the protection of God would be of no avail to him, fixes the attention on this blasphemy, which severely wounded his heart, by the use of the word <em>Selah; </em>and as a little after, when he has added a new ground of confidence with regard to the safety of his person, he repeats the same word. </p></div>
