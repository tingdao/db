<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>I will be glad and rejoice in thy goodness. </em>Here is inserted a thanksgiving, although many are rather of opinion that David’s prayer is suspended, and that he makes a vow, when he shall be delivered from present danger. But as no condition is annexed, I am rather inclined to think that stopping all at once in the middle of his prayer, he promises himself a deliverance, for which he will have abundant matter for giving thanks. Nor is it to be wondered at that different feelings are mingled in the psalms in which David has set forth his own temptations, as well as the resistance which his faith made to them, considering also that when he sung the praises of God, after having already obtained deliverance from him, he embraces different periods in his song, as he here says, <em>that God had regarded his affliction, intimating </em>by this the effect of the assistance which God had afforded him. And that he may the better confirm this, he adds, <em>that he had not been delivered into the hands of his enemies: </em>in which words there is an implied antithesis, namely, that when he was encompassed on every side by severe afflictions, he was marvellously delivered by God. This is also farther intimated by the following sentence, <em>Thou hast set my feet in a large place, </em><span class="cite-ref">(642)</span> which denotes a sudden and unexpected change. </p><p><strong>(642)</strong> “There is a contrast in the expression between the straits to which he had been confined, and the freedom which was now bestowed upon him.” —<em>Walford. </em></p></div>
