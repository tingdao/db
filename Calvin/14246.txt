<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>He who is clean of hands, and pure of heart. </em>Under the purity of the hands and of the heart, and the reverence of God’s name, he comprehends all religion, and denotes a well ordered life. True purity, no doubt, has its seat in the heart, but it manifests its fruits in the works of the hands. The Psalmist, therefore, very properly joins to a pure heart the purity of the whole life; for that man acts a ridiculous part who boasts of having a sound heart, if he does not show by his fruits that the root is good. On the other hand, it will not suffice to frame the hands, feet, and eyes, according to the rule of righteousness, unless purity of heart precede outward continence. If any man should think it absurd that the first place is given to the hands, we answer without hesitation, that effects are often named before their causes, not that they precede them in order, but because it is sometimes advantageous to begin with things which are best known. David, then, would have the Jews to bring into the presence of God pure hands, and these along with an unfeigned heart. <em>To lift up</em>, or <em>to take his soul</em>, I have no doubt is here put for to swear. It is, therefore, here required of the servants of God, that when they swear, they do it with reverence and in good conscience, <span class="cite-ref">(545)</span> and, under one particular, by synecdoche, is denoted the duty of observing fidelity and integrity in all the affairs of life. That mention is here made of oaths, appears from the words which immediately follow, <em>And hath not sworn deceitfully</em>, which are added as explanatory of what goes before. As, however, there is a twofold reading of the Hebrew word for soul, that is to say, as it may be read, <em>my soul</em>, or <em>his soul</em>, on account of the point <em>hirek</em>, some Jewish commentators read, <em>Who hath not lifted up my soul to vanity</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(546)</span> and understand the word <em>my </em>as spoken of God, an exposition which I reject as harsh and strained. It is a manner of speaking which carries in it great emphasis, for it means, that those who swear offer their souls as pledges to God. Some, however, may perhaps prefer the opinion, that <em>to lift up the soul</em>, is put for <em>to apply it to lying</em>, an interpretation to the adoption of which I have no great objection, for it makes little difference as to the sense. A question may here be raised — it may be asked, why David does not say so much as one word concerning faith and calling upon God. The reason of this is easily explained. As it seldom happens that a man behaves himself uprightly and innocently towards his brethren, unless he is so endued with the true fear of God as to walk circumspectly before him, David very justly forms his estimate of the piety of men towards God by the character of their conduct towards their fellow-men. For the same reason, Christ (<span class="bvs">Mat_23:23</span>) represents judgment, mercy, and faith, as the principal points of the law; and Paul calls “charity” at one time “the end of the law,” (<span class="bvs">1Ti_1:5</span>) and at another “the bond of perfection” (<span class="bvs">Col_3:14</span>.) </p><p><strong>(545)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par ainsi il est yci requis des serviteurs de Dieu, que quand ils jurent, ce soit avec reverence et en bonne conscience</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(546)</strong> The textual reading is <span class="lang he-il">נפשו</span>, <em>naphshiv, his soul; </em>the marginal reading is <span class="lang he-il">נפשו</span><em>, naphshi, my soul. </em>But the textual reading, from its clearness and simplicity, is, without doubt, the correct one. “The points,” says <em>Hammond</em>, “direct to render <span class="lang he-il">נפשת</span><em>my soul, </em>and so the interlinear reads <em>anilmain roeare, my soul </em>or <em>life, </em>as if it were making God the speaker of this verse, and then it is God’s life or soul. But the text writing <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> not <span class="lang he-il">י</span>, and the context agreeing with it, the punctuation must, in reason, give place; and, accordingly, all the ancient interpreters appear to have read it <span class="lang he-il">נפשו</span><em>, his soul, </em>meaning by that <em>his own soul, </em>or the <em>soul of the swearer.” </em></p></div>
