<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13</strong><em>This their way is foolishness </em>As this verse has been variously rendered, I shall briefly, before giving my own sense of it, state the views which have been taken by others. As the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">כסל</span><em>, kesel, </em>which I have translated <em>foolishness, </em>occasionally means <em>the kidneys, </em>some refine upon the term, and consider it to be here taken for <em>fat; </em>as if this imagination of theirs were, so to speak, fat which stupified and rendered their senses obtuse. But this reading is too forced to bear examination. Others read, <em>This their way is their folly; </em><span class="cite-ref">(226)</span> that is, the reason why they pursue such a line of conduct is, that they are destitute of sound judgment; for, were they not utterly devoid of it, and did they possess one spark of intelligence, would they not reflect upon the end for which they were created, and direct their minds to higher objects? I rather conceive the Psalmist simply to mean, that the event proves them to be wholly destitute of wisdom, in placing their happiness upon earthly objects, and brands them, notwithstanding all the pretensions they make to foresight and shrewdness, with ridicule and contempt. And this he states, to show in a more aggravated light the madness of their posterity, who will not be instructed by the fate of their predecessors. The last clause of the verse has also been variously rendered, and I may state the views which have been taken of it by others. The Hebrew verb <span class="lang he-il">רצה</span>, <em>ratsah, </em>which I have translated <em>to acquiesce, </em>they render, <em>to walk, </em>and the noun <span class="lang he-il">פי</span>, <em>phi, </em>translated <em>mouth </em>or <em>sayings, </em>they take to mean <em>a measure, </em>thus understanding the Psalmist to say, that the children walked by the same rule with their fathers; and they change the letter <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, <em>beth, </em>into <span class="lang he-il">כ</span><em>, caph, </em>the mark of similitude which is sufficiently common in the Hebrew language. This view of the passage comes near to the proper meaning of it. Some conceive that there is an allusion to the beasts of the field; but this is improbable. It seems best to understand with others that the word mouth denotes <em>principles </em>or <em>sayings; </em>and the verb <span class="lang he-il">רצה</span>, <em>ratsah, </em>may be taken in its more ordinary and most generally received sense, which implies consent or complacency. I have therefore translated it <em>to acquiesce. </em>The boasted confidence of the ungodly proving vain in the issue, and exposing them justly to ridicule, it argues a monstrous infatuation in their posterity, with this example before their eyes, to set their affections upon the same trifles, and to feel and express themselves exactly in the same manner as those who went before them. If men reflect at all upon the judgments which God executes in the world, we might expect that they would particularly consider his dealings with their immediate predecessors, and when, wholly insensible to the lessons which should be learned from their fate, they precipitate themselves into the same courses, this convincingly demonstrates their brutish folly. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(226)</span> “<span class="lang he-il">כסל למו</span> is literally, <em>folly to them</em>; <em>i e</em>. , though this their way (the worldling’s trust in his wealth), seem to them a piece of special wisdom, yet in the event it proves otherwise; it becomes perfect folly to them when they come to discern their frustrations.” —<em>Hammond </em></p></div></div>
