<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Whether we are afflicted. </em>From the circumstance that before the clause <em>our hope of you is steadfast, </em>there is introduced the connecting particle <em>and, </em>Erasmus has conceived the idea, that some word must be understood to correspond with those words — <em>for your consolation and salvation </em>— in this way, <em>whether we are afflicted, </em>IT IS<em>for your consolation. </em>I think it, however, more probable, that the connecting particle <em>and </em>is used here as meaning: <em>Thus also, </em>or <em>in both cases. </em>He had already stated, that he received consolation in order that he might communicate it to others. Now he goes a step farther, and says, that he has a <em>steadfast hope, </em>that they <em>would be partakers of the consolation </em>Besides, some of the most ancient Greek manuscripts introduce immediately after the first clause this statement — <em>and our hope of you is steadfast. </em><span class="cite-ref">(227)</span> This reading removes all ambiguity. For when it is introduced in the middle, we must necessarily refer it to the latter clause, equally as to the former. At the same time, if any one wishes to have a complete sentence in each clause, by supplying some verb, there will be no great harm in this, and there will be no great difference as to the meaning. For if you read it as one continued statement, you must, at the same time, explain the different parts in this manner — that the Apostle is afflicted, and is refreshed with consolation for the advantage of the Corinthians; and that he entertains, therefore, the hope, <span class="cite-ref">(228)</span> that they will be at length partakers of the same consolation, with what is in reserve for himself. For my own part, I have adopted the way that I have judged the more suitable. </p><p>It is, however, to be observed, that the word <em>afflicted </em>here refers not merely to outward misery, but also to that of the mind, so as to correspond with the opposite term <em>comforted. </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">παρακαλεῖσθαι</span>) Thus the meaning is, that the person’s mind is pressed down with anxiety from a feeling of misery. <span class="cite-ref">(229)</span> What we render <em>consolation, </em>is in the Greek <span class="lang el-gr">παράκλησις</span>, — a term which signifies also <em>exhortation. </em>If, however, you understand that kind of consolation, by which a person’s mind is lightened of grief, and is raised above it, you will be in possession of Paul’s meaning. For example, Paul himself would well-nigh have fallen down dead under the pressure of so many afflictions, had not God encouraged him, by raising him up by means of his consolation. Thus, too, the Corinthians derive strength and fortitude of mind from his sufferings, <span class="cite-ref">(230)</span> while they take comfort from his example. Let us now sum up the whole matter briefly. As he saw that his afflictions were made by some an occasion of holding him in contempt, with the view of calling back the Corinthians from an error of this nature, <span class="cite-ref">(231)</span> he shows in the first place that he ought to be in high esteem among them, in consideration of advantage redounding to themselves; and then afterwards he associates them with himself, that they may reckon his afflictions to be in a manner their own. “Whether I suffer afflictions, or experience consolation, it is all for your benefit, and I cherish an assured hope, that you will continue to enjoy this advantage.” <span class="cite-ref">(232)</span></p><p>For such were Paul’s afflictions, and his consolations also, that they would have contributed to the edification of the Corinthians, had not the Corinthians of their own accord deprived themselves of the advantage redounding from it. He, accordingly, declares his confidence in the Corinthians to be such, that he entertains the assured hope that it will not be vain, that he has been afflicted, and has received consolation for their advantage. The false apostles made every effort to turn to Paul’s reproach everything that befell him. Had they obtained their wish, the afflictions which he endured for their salvation, had been vain and fruitless; they would have derived no advantage from the consolations with which the Lord refreshed him. To contrivances of this nature he opposes his present confidence. His afflictions tended to promote the comfort of believers, as furnishing them with occasion of confirmation, on their perceiving that he suffered willingly, and endured with fortitude so many hardships for the sake of the gospel. For however we may acknowledge that afflictions ought to be endured by us for the sake of the gospel, we, nevertheless, tremble through a consciousness of our weakness, and think ourselves not prepared for it. <span class="cite-ref">(233)</span> In that case, we should call to mind the examples of the saints, which should make us more courageous. </p><p>On the other hand, his personal consolation flowed out to the whole Church, inasmuch as they concluded, <span class="cite-ref">(234)</span> that God who had sustained and refreshed him in his emergency, would, in like manner, not be wanting to them. Thus their welfare was promoted in both ways, and this is what he introduces as it were by way of parenthesis, when he says — <em>which is made effectual in the endurance, </em>etc. For he wished to add this clause, by way of explanation, that they might not think that they had nothing to do with the afflictions which he alone endured. Erasmus takes the participle <span class="lang el-gr">γουμένης</span> in an active sense, <span class="cite-ref">(235)</span> but a passive signification is more suitable, <span class="cite-ref">(236)</span> as Paul designed simply to explain in what respect everything that befell him was for their <em>salvation. </em>He says, accordingly, that he suffers, indeed, alone, but that his sufferings are of use for promoting their <em>salvation </em>— not as though they were expiations or sacrifices for sins, but as edifying them by confirming them. Hence he conjoins consolation and salvation, with the view of pointing out the way in which their salvation was to be accomplished. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(227)</span> Dr. Bloomfield, who gives to this reading of the passage his decided preference, says of it: “The evidence in its favor is exceedingly strong; while that for the common reading is exceedingly weak.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(228)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il ha certain espoir</span>;” — “That he has a sure hope.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(229)</span> “<span class="lang el-gr">θλίψις</span> ”, says Dr. Bloomfield, in his Notes on <span class="bvs">Mat_24:9</span>, “properly signifies compression, and figuratively constraint, oppression, affliction, and persecution.” — Ed. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(230)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Voyans les passions du sainct Apostre</span>;” — “Beholding the sufferings of the holy Apostle.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(231)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin d’oster aux Corinthiens ceste mauuaise fantasie</span>;” — “With the view of ridding the Corinthians of this wicked fancy.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(232)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Iusques en la fin</span>;” — “Until the end.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(233)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et ne pensons point estre assez forts</span>;” — “And do not think that we are sufficiently strong.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(234)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les fideles recueilloyent de là, et s’asseuroyent</span>;” — “Believers inferred from this, and assured themselves.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(235)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Traduisant, Qui oeuure ou besongne</span>;” — “Rendering it, Which works or labors.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(236)</span> Dr. Bloomfield, in his Notes on <span class="bvs">1Th_2:13</span>, explains <span class="lang el-gr">ἐνεργεῖται</span>, to mean — “<em>is made effectual</em>, ” or “shews itself in its effects,” and adds: “This view I find supported by the opinion of Schott, who maintains that <span class="lang el-gr">ἐνεργεῖσθαι</span>, is never in the New Testament used as a <em>middle </em>form, with an active sense; but always (especially in St. Paul’s writings) as a <em>passive</em>. Indeed, Bp. Bull, Exam. p. 9, goes yet farther, and asserts, that it is scarcely ever so used, even in the <em>Classical </em>writers (I believe he might have said never) but always in a passive sense.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
