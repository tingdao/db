<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>For I did not reckon it desirable. </em>As <span class="lang el-gr">κρίνειν</span>, in Greek, has often the same meaning as <span class="lang el-gr">εκλεγειν</span>, that is to choose out anything as precious, <span class="cite-ref">(104)</span> there is, I think, no person of sound judgment but will allow that the rendering that I have given is a probable one, provided only the construction admits of it. At the same time, if we render it thus — “No kind of knowledge did I hold in esteem,” there will be nothing harsh in this rendering. If you understand something to be supplied, the sentence will run smoothly enough in this way — “Nothing did I value myself upon, as worth my knowing, or on the ground of knowledge.” At the same time I do not altogether reject a different interpretation — viewing Paul as declaring that he esteemed nothing as knowledge, or as entitled to be called knowledge, except Christ alone. Thus the Greek preposition <span class="lang el-gr">ανδ</span>, would, as often happens, require to be supplied. But whether the former interpretation is not disapproved of, or whether this latter pleases better, the substance of the passage amounts to this: “As to my wanting the ornaments of speech, and wanting, too, the more elegant refinements of discourse, the reason of this was, that I did not aspire at them, nay rather, I despised them, because there was one thing only that my heart was set upon — that I might preach Christ with simplicity.” </p><p>In adding the word <em>crucified, </em>he does not mean that he preached nothing respecting Christ except the cross; but that, with all the abasement of the cross, he nevertheless preached Christ. It is as though he had said: “The ignominy of the cross will not prevent me from looking up to him <span class="cite-ref">(105)</span> from whom salvation comes, or <em>make </em>me ashamed to regard all my wisdom as comprehended in him — in him, I say, whom proud men despise and reject on account of the reproach of the cross.” Hence the statement must be explained in this way: “No kind of knowledge was in my view of so much importance as to lead me to desire anything but Christ, <em>crucified though he was</em>. ” This little clause is added by way of enlargement (<span class="lang el-gr">αὔξησιν</span>,) with the view of galling so much the more those arrogant masters, by whom Christ was next to despised, as they were eager to gain applause by being renowned for a higher kind of wisdom. Here we have a beautiful passage, from which we learn what it is that faithful ministers ought to teach, what it is that we must, during our whole life, be learning, and in comparison with which everything else must be “counted as dung.” (<span class="bvs">Phi_3:8</span>.) </p><p><strong>(104)</strong> Xenophon uses <span class="lang el-gr">κρινω</span> in the sense of <em>choosing out</em>, or <em>preferring</em>: in Mem. 4. 4, sec. 16, <span class="lang el-gr">ουχ ὁπως τους αυτους χορους κρινωσιν οἱ πολιται</span> — not that the citizens should prefer the dances.” See also Menander, prefer the same line 245, edit. Cleric. In the New Testament we find <span class="lang el-gr">κρινω</span> used in the sense of <em>esteeming</em>, in <span class="bvs">Rom_14:5</span>. — <em>Ed </em></p><p><strong>(105)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne fera point que ie n’aye en reuerence et admiration</span>;” — “Will not prevent me from holding in reverence and admiration.” </p></div>
