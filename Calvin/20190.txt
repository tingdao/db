<div class="comment-content"><p>Here, in the first place, Jeremiah asks in astonishment how it happened that <em>the hammer of the whole earth was broken, </em>when it had before broken all nations. God afterwards gives an answer, even because “I am he who have taken Babylon.” The question availed to rouse the people to a greater attention. We neglect God’s judgments or are blind to them, even because we do not carefully consider them; for little things often excite us, when that which God works in an unusual manner is deemed by us as nothing. As then our apathy as to the works of God is so great, it is necessary to stimulate us. And this is what is done now by Jeremiah, when he says in astonishment, <em>How? </em>for he intimates that to cut down Babylon would be incredible, for no one could have thought that that monarchy could have ever fallen; for it had arrived to the highest <em>eminence, </em>and was surrounded on all sides by so many fortresses, that no danger could be feared. In short, all thought that Babylon could not be endangered without a concussion of heaven and earth. </p><p>Then the Prophet here wonders at a thing unusual, and says, <em>How is the hammer of all the earth broken and shattered to pieces? </em><span class="cite-ref">(64)</span> and then, <em>How has Babylon become a waste among the nations? </em>for it had subjugated to itself not only the neighboring nations, but the remotest parts of the earth. And in this manner he animated the faithful to entertain hope, lest they should despond, for the power of that monarchy was terrible. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(64)</span> The first verb, <span class="lang he-il">גדע</span>, means to cast off as well as to cut off; the breaking is expressed by the following verb.
