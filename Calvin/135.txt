<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work</em>. In the Hebrew languages the etymology of the verb <span class="lang he-il">נחם</span> (<em>nacham</em>) does not correspond with the noun <span class="lang he-il">נוח</span> (<em>noach</em>,) unless we call the letter <span class="lang he-il">ם</span> (<em>mem</em>) superfluous; as sometimes, in composition, certain letters are redundant. <span class="lang he-il">נוח</span><em>Noach </em>signifies to <em>give rest</em>, but <span class="lang he-il">נחם</span><em>nacham </em>to <em>comfort</em>. The name Noah is derived from the former verb. Wherefore, there is either the transmutation of one letter into another, or only a bare <em>allusion</em>, when Lamech says, “This same shall comfort us concerning our work.” <span class="cite-ref">(257)</span> But as to the point in hand, there is no doubt that he promises to himself an alleviation, or solace, of his labors. But it is asked, whence he had conceived such hope from a son whose disposition he could not yet have discerned. The Jews do not judge erroneously in declaring Lamech’s expression to be a prophecy; but they are too gross in restricting to agriculture what is applicable to all those miseries of human life which proceed from the curse of God, and are the fruits of sin. I come, indeed, to this conclusion; that the holy fathers anxiously sighed, when, being surrounded with so many evils they were continually reminded of the first origin of all evils, and regarded themselves as under the displeasure of God. Therefore in the expression, the toil of our hands, there is the figure <em>synecdochee</em>; because under one kind of toil he comprises the whole miserable state into which mankind had fallen. For they undoubtedly remembered what Moses has related above, concerning the labourious, sad, and anxious life to which Adam had been doomed: and since the wickedness of man was daily increasing, no mitigation of the penalty could be hoped for, unless the Lord should bring unexpected succor. It is probable that they were very earnestly looking for the mercy of God; for their faith was strong, and necessity urged them ardently to desire help. But that the name was not rashly given to Noah, we may infer hence, that Moses expressly notes it as a thing worthy to be remembered. Certainly some meaning was couched under the names of other patriarchs; yet he passes by the reason why they were so called, and only insists upon this name of Noah. Therefore the contentious reader is not to be allowed hence to pronounce a judgment, that there was something peculiar in Noah, which did not suit others before him. I have, then, no doubt that Lamech hoped for something rare and unwonted from his son; and that, too, by the inspiration of the Spirit. Some suppose him to have been deceived, inasmuch as he believed that Noah was the Christ; but they adduce no rational conjecture in support of the opinion. It is more probable, that, seeing something great was promised concerning his son, he did not refrain from mixing his own imagination with the oracle; as holy men are also sometimes wont to exceed the measure of revelation, and thus it comes to pass, that they neither touch heaven nor earth. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(257)</span> See Schindler’s Lexicon, sub voce <span class="lang he-il">נחם</span>, No. III and also, sub voce <span class="lang he-il">נוח</span>, as a proper name, where he derives the latter word from the former, “litera<span class="lang he-il">ם</span>abjecta, aut, quod consolatio sit quies, recreatio.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
