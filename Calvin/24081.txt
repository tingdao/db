<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_26:26</span><strong>.</strong><em>And while they were eating, Jesus took bread. </em>I do not understand these words to mean that with the paschal supper was mixed this new and more excellent supper, but rather that an end was then put to the former banquet. This is still more clearly expressed by Luke, when he says that, Christ <em>gave the cup after that he had supped; </em>for it would have been absurd that one and the same mystery should be broken off by an interval of time. And therefore I have no doubt that, in immediate succession, after having distributed the bread, he added the cup; and what Luke relates particularly respecting the cup, I regard as including also the bread. <em>While they were eating, </em>therefore, Christ took bread, to invite them to partake of a new supper. <span class="cite-ref">(190)</span> The <em>thanksgiving </em>was a sort of preparation and transition to consider the mystery. Thus when the supper was ended, they tasted the sacred <em>bread </em>and <em>wine; </em>because Christ had previously aroused them from their indifference, that they might be all alive to so lofty a mystery. And, indeed, the nature of the case demands that this clear testimony of the spiritual life should be distinguished from the ancient shadow. </p><p><em>Jesus took bread. </em>It is uncertain if the custom which is now observed among the Jews was at that time in use: for the master of the house breaks off a portion of a common loaf, hides it under the table-cloth, and afterwards distributes a part of it to, each member of the family. But as this is a human tradition not founded on any commandment of God, we need not toil with excessive eagerness to investigate its origin; and it is possible that it may have been afterwards contrived, by a trick of Satan, for the purpose of obscuring the mystery of the Lord’s Supper. And even if this ceremony was at that time in use among the Jews, Christ followed the ordinary custom in such a manner as to draw away the minds of his followers to another object, by changing the use of the <em>bread </em>for a different purpose. This, at least, ought to be considered as beyond all controversy, that Christ, at this time, abolished the figures of the Law, and instituted a new Sacrament. </p><p><em>When he had given thanks. </em>Matthew and Mark employ the word <span class="lang el-gr">εὐλογήσας</span><span class="cite-ref">(191)</span><em>(having blessed;) </em>but as Luke employs, instead of it, the word <span class="lang el-gr">εὐχαριστήσας</span><em>(having given thanks,) </em>there can be no doubt as to the meaning; and as they afterwards use the word <em>thanksgiving </em>in reference to <em>the cup, </em>they expound with sufficient clearness the former term. So much the more ridiculous is the ignorance of the Papists, who express the <em>blessing </em>by the sign of the cross, as if Christ had practiced some kind of exorcising. But we must recollect what I lately noticed, that this <em>thanksgiving </em>is connected with a spiritual mystery. While it is true that believers are commanded to give thanks to God, because he supports them in this fading life, Christ did not merely refer to ordinary eating, but directed his view to the holy action, in order to thank God for the eternal salvation of the human race. For if the food which descends into the belly ought to persuade and arouse us to praise the fatherly kindness of God, how much more powerfully does it excite and even inflame, us to this act of piety, when he feeds our souls spiritually? </p><p><em>Take, eat. </em>That I may not be too tedious, I shall only explain briefly what is the nature of our Lord’s institution, and what it contains; and, next, what is its end and us so far as it may be learned from the Evangelists. And, first of all, it strikes us, that Christ instituted a <em>supper, </em>which the disciples partake in company with each other. Hence it follows, that it is a diabolical invention, that a man, separating himself from the rest of the company, eats his supper apart. For what two things could be more inconsistent than that the bread should be distributed among them all, and that a single individual should swallow it alone? Although then the Papists boast, that in their masses they have the substance of the Lord’s Supper, yet it is evident from the nature of the case, that whenever they celebrate private masses, they are so many trophies erected by the devil for burying the Lord’s Supper. </p><p>The same words teach us what sort of sacrifice it is that Christ recommends to us in the Supper. He bids his disciples <em>take; </em>and therefore it is himself alone that offers. What the Papists contrive, as to Christ’s offering himself in the Supper, proceeded from an opposite author. And certainly it is a strange inversion, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀναστροφὴ</span>,) when a mortal man, who is commanded to <em>take </em>the body of Christ, claims the office of offering it; and thus a priest, who has been appointed by himself, sacrifices to God his own Son. I do not at present inquire with how many acts of sacrilege their pretended offering abounds. It is sufficient for my purpose, that it is so far from approaching to Christ’s institution, that it is directly opposed to it. </p><p><em>This is my body. </em>As to the opinion entertained by some, that by those words the bread was <em>consecrated, </em>so as to become the symbol of the flesh of Christ, I do not find fault with it, provided that the word <em>consecrated </em>be understood aright, and in a proper sense. So then, the <em>bread, </em>which had been appointed for the nourishment of the body, is chosen and sanctified by Christ to a different use, so as to begin to be spiritual food. And this is the <em>conversion </em><span class="cite-ref">(192)</span> which is spoken of by the ancient doctors <span class="cite-ref">(193)</span> of the Church. But we must at the same time hold, that bread is not <em>consecrated </em>by whispering and breathing, but by the clear doctrine of faith. And certainly it is a piece of magic and sorcery, when the <em>consecration </em>is addressed to the dead element; for <em>the bread </em>is made not to itself, but to us, a symbol of the body of Christ. In short, <em>consecration </em>is nothing else than a solemn testimony, by which the Lord appoints to us for a spiritual use an earthly and corruptible sign; which cannot take place, unless his command and promise are distinctly heard for the edification of faith; from which again it is evident, that the low whispering and breathing of the Papists are a wicked profanation of the mystery. Now if Christ consecrates the bread, when he declares to us that it is <em>his body, </em>we must not suppose that there is any change of the substance, but must only believe that it is applied to a new purpose. And if the world had not been long ago so bewitched by the subtlety of the devil, that, when the monster of transubstantiation had once been introduced, it will not now admit any light of true interpretation on these words, it would be superfluous to spend any more time in investigating their meaning. </p><p>Christ declares that <em>the bread is his body. </em>These words relate to a sacrament; and it must be acknowledged, that a sacrament consists of a visible sign, with which is connected the thing signified, which is the reality of it. It must be well known, on the other hand, that the name of the thing signified is transferred to the sign; and therefore, no person who is tolerably well acquainted with Scripture will deny that a sacramental mode of expression ought to be taken metonymically. <span class="cite-ref">(194)</span> I pass by general figures, which occur frequently in Scripture, and only say this: whenever an outward sign is said to be that which it represents, it is universally agreed to be an instance of metonymy. If <em>baptism </em>be called <em>the laver of regeneration, </em>(Titus in. 5;) if <em>the rock, </em>from which water flowed to the Fathers in the wilderness, be called <em>Christ, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_10:4</span>;) if <em>a dove </em>be called <em>the Holy Spirit, </em>(<span class="bvs">Joh_1:32</span>;) no man will question but the signs receive the name of the things which they represent. How comes it, then, that persons who profess to entertain a veneration for the words of the Lord will not permit us to apply to the Lord’s Supper what is common to all the sacraments? </p><p>They are delighted with the plain and literal sense. Why then shall not the same rule apply to all the sacraments? Certainly, if they do not admit that <em>the Rock </em>was actually <em>Christ, </em>the calumny with which they load us is mere affectation. If we explain that <em>the bread </em>is called <em>his body, </em>because it is the symbol of <em>his body, </em>they allege that the whole doctrine of Scripture is overturned. For this principle of language has not been recently forged by us, but has been handed down by Augustine on the authority of the ancients, and embraced by all, that the names of spiritual things are improperly ascribed to signs, and that all the passages of Scripture, in which the sacraments are mentioned, ought to be explained in this manner. When we bring forward a principle which has been universally admitted, what purpose does it serve to raise a loud clamor, as if it were something new and strange? But let obstinate people cry out as they please, all men of sound judgment and modesty will admit, that in these words of Christ there is a sacramental form of expression. Hence it follows, that <em>the bread </em>is called <em>his body, </em>because it is a symbol of the body of Christ. </p><p>Now there are two classes of men that rise up against us. The Papists, deceived by their transubstantiation, maintain that what we see is not <em>bread, </em>because it is only the appearance that remains without the reality. But their absurd fancy is refuted by Paul, who asserts that </p><p>the bread which we break is the communion of the body of Christ, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_10:16</span>.) </p><p>Besides, their notion is at variance with the very nature of a sacrament, which will not possess all that is essential to it, if there be not a true outward symbol. For whence shall we learn that our souls feed on the flesh of Christ, if what is placed before our eyes be not <em>bread, </em>but an empty form? Besides, what will they say about the other symbol? For Christ does not say, <em>This is my blood, </em>but, <em>this cup is the new testament in my blood. </em>According to their view, therefore, not only the <em>wine, </em>but also the materials of which <em>the cup </em>is composed, must be transubstantiated into <em>blood. </em>Again, the words related by Matthew — <em>I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine </em>— plainly show that what he delivered to the disciples to drink was <em>wine; </em>so that in every way the ignorance of the Papists is fully exposed. </p><p>But there are others who reject the figure, and, like madmen, unsay what they had just said. According to them, <em>bread </em>is truly and properly <em>body; </em>for they disapprove of transubstantiation, as wholly devoid of reason and plausibility. But when the question is put to them, if Christ be <em>bread </em>and <em>wine, </em>they reply that the <em>bread </em>is called <em>body, </em>because under it and along with it the <em>body </em>is received in the Lord’s Supper. But from this reply it may be readily concluded, that the word <em>body </em>is improperly applied to the <em>bread, </em>which is a sign of it. And since those men have constantly in their mouth, that Christ spoke thus in reference to a sacramental union, it is strange that they do not consider what they say. For what is the nature of a sacramental union between a thing and its sign? Is it not because the Lord, by the secret power of his Spirit, fulfills what he promises? So then those later instructions about the letter are not less absurd than the Papists. </p><p>Hitherto I have pointed out the simple exposition of the words of our Lord. But now I must add, that it is not an empty or unmeaning sign which is held out to us, but those who receive this promise by faith are actually made partakers of his flesh and blood. For in vain would the Lord command his people to eat <em>bread, </em>declaring that <em>it is his body, </em>if the effect were not truly added to the figure. Nor must it be supposed that we dispute this point, whether it is in reality, or only by signification, that Christ presents himself to be enjoyed by us in the Lord’s Supper; for, though we perceive nothing in it but bread, yet he does not disappoint or mock us, when he undertakes to nourish our souls by his flesh. The true eating of the flesh of Christ, therefore, is not only pointed out by the sign, but is likewise exhibited in reality. </p><p>But there are three mistakes against which it is here necessary to be on our guard; first, not to confound the spiritual blessing with the sign; secondly, not to seek Christ on earth, or under earthly elements; thirdly, not to imagine any other kind of <em>eating </em>than that which draws into us the life of Christ by the secret power of the Spirit, and which we obtain by faith alone. First, as I have said, let us always keep in view the distinction between the sign and the thing signified, if we do not wish to overturn every thing; for otherwise we shall derive no advantage from the sacrament, if it do not, according to the measure of our small capacity, lead us from the contemplation of the earthly element to the heavenly mystery. And therefore, whoever will not distinguish the <em>body </em>of Christ from the <em>bread, </em>and the <em>blood </em>from the <em>wine, </em>will never understand what is meant by the Lord’s Supper, or for what purpose believers use these symbols. </p><p>Secondly, we must attend to the proper method of seeking Christ; that is, our minds must not be fixed on the earth, but must ascend upwards to the heavenly glory in which he dwells. For the body of Christ did not, by clothing itself with an incorruptible life, lay aside its own nature; and hence it follows that it is finite. <span class="cite-ref">(195)</span> But he has now ascended above the heavens, that no gross imagination may keep us occupied with earthly things. And certainly, if this mystery is heavenly, nothing could be more unreasonable than to draw down Christ to the earth, when, on the contrary, he calls us upwards to himself. </p><p>The last point which, I said, claimed our attention, is the kind of <em>eating. </em>We must not dream that his substance passes, in a natural manner, into our souls; but we cat his flesh, when, by means of it, we receive life. For we must attend to the analogy or resemblance between <em>bread </em>and <em>flesh, </em>which teaches us, that our souls feed on Christ’s <em>own flesh </em>in precisely the same manner as <em>bread </em>imparts vigor to our bodies. The <em>flesh </em>of Christ, therefore, is spiritual nourishment, because it gives life to us. Now it gives life, because the Holy Spirit pours into us the life which dwells in it. And though the act of <em>eating the flesh </em>of Christ is different from believing on him, yet we ought to know that it is impossible to feed on Christ in any other way than by faith, because the eating itself is a consequence of faith. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(190)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’un noveau souper, c’est, à scavoir de la Cene</span>;” — “of a new supper, that is, of the Lord’s Supper.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(191)</span> In the Greek text, Calvin appears to have followed the ordinary reading, <span class="lang el-gr">εὐλογήσας,</span> instead of <span class="lang el-gr">εὐχαριστήσας,</span> for which there appears to be a preponderance of authorities. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(192)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La conversion ou changement</span>;” — “the conversion, or change.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(193)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les anciens docteurs</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(194)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par une figure qui s’appele metonymie; c’est à dire, transmutation de nom</span>;” — “by a figure which is called metonymy; that is, the putting of one name for another.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(195)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Dont s’ensuit qu’il n’est past infini, mais consiste en quelque certain lieu</span>;” — “whence it follows that it is not infinite, but remains in some particular spot.” </p></div></div>
