<div class="comment-content"><p>The letters of the alphabet are tripled in this chapter, which I had omitted to mention. In the first two chapters each verse begins with the successive letters of the alphabet, except that in the last chapter there is one instance of inversion, for Jeremiah has put <span class="lang he-il">פ</span>, <em>phi</em>, before <span class="lang he-il">ע</span>, <em>oin; </em>or it may be that the order has been changed by the scribes; but this is uncertain. Here then, as I have said, each letter is thrice repeated. Then the first, the second, and the third verse begins with <span class="lang he-il">א</span><em>aleph; </em>and the fourth begins with <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, <em>beth</em>, and so he goes on to the end. <span class="cite-ref">(174)</span></p><p>He confirms here the last verse, for lie shews the cause or the manner of his afflictions, for he had been led into darkness and not into light. This kind of contrast has not the same force in other languages as it has in Hebrew. But when the Hebrews said that they were in darkness and not in the light, they amplified that obscurity, as though they had said that there was not even a spark of light in that darkness, it being so thick and obscure. This is what the Prophet now means. And we know what is everywhere understood in Scripture by darkness, even every kind of Lamentation: for the appearance of light exhilarates us, yea, the serenity of heaven cheers and revives the minds of men. Then darkness signifies all sorts of adversities and the sorrow which proceeds from them. He afterwards adds, — </p><p><strong>(174)</strong> The verses in this chapter are needlessly multiplied. It would have been better had each verse contained a letter, for the length of this chapter is the same with the two foregoing; the only difference is, that the lines, or alternate lines, begin with the same letter three times, as follows, — </p><p><span class="lang he-il">א</span> I am the man who hath seen affliction, <LineBreak />Through the rod of his indignation; <LineBreak /><span class="lang he-il">א</span> Me hath he led and caused to walk <LineBreak />In darkness, and not in light; <LineBreak /><span class="lang he-il">א</span> Surely against me he turns, <LineBreak />Upset me does his hand all the day. </p><p>The three next lines, or alternate lines, begin with <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>, and so on to the end of the alphabet — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
