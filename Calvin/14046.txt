<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>The ungodly, in the pride of his countenance, etc </em>Others translate the words, <em>The ungodly man, by reason of the violence of his anger, </em>or, <em>in the pride which he displays, does not inquire after God. </em>But this partly perverts the meaning, and partly weakens the force of what David intended to express. In the first place, the word <em>inquire, </em>which is here put absolutely, that is, without any noun which it governs, is, according to this translation, improperly limited to God. David simply means, that the ungodly, without examination, permit themselves to do any thing, or do not distinguish between what is lawful and unlawful, because their own lust is their law, yea, rather, as if superior to all laws, they fancy that it is lawful for them to do whatever they please. The beginning of well-doing in a man’s life is inquiry; in other words, we can only begin to do well when we keep ourselves from following, without choice and discrimination, the dictates of our own fancy, and from being carried away by the wayward propensities of our flesh. But the exercise of inquiring proceeds from humility, when we assign to God, as is reasonable, the place of judge and ruler over us. The prophet, therefore, very properly says, that the reason why the ungodly, without any regard or consideration, presume to do whatever they desire, is because, being lifted up with pride, they leave to God nothing whatever of the prerogative of a judge. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">פף</span>, <em>aph, </em>which we have translated <em>countenance, </em>I have no doubt is here taken in its proper and natural signification, and not metaphorically for <em>anger; </em>because haughty persons show their effrontery even by their countenance. </p><p>In the second clause, the prophet more severely, or, at least, more openly, accuses them, declaring that all their wicked imaginations show that they have no God. <em>All his devices say, There is no God </em><span class="cite-ref">(200)</span> By these words I understand, that through their heaven-daring presumption, they subvert all piety and justice, as if there were no God sitting in heaven. Did they truly believe that there is a God, the fear of the judgment to come would restrain them. Not that they plainly and distinctly deny the existence of a God, but then they strip him of his power. Now, God would be merely like an idol, if, contented with an inactive existence, he should divest himself of his office as judge. Whoever, therefore, refuse to admit that the world is subject to the providence of God, or do not believe that his hand is stretched forth from on high to govern it, do as much as in them lies to put an end to the existence of God. It is not, however, enough to have some cold and unimpressive knowledge of him in the head; it is only the true and heartfelt conviction of his providence which makes us reverence him, and which keeps us in subjection <span class="cite-ref">(201)</span> to him. The greater part of interpreters understand the last clause as meaning generally, that all the thoughts of a wicked man tend to the denial of a God. In my opinion, the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">מזמות</span>, <em>mezimmoth, </em>is here, as in many other places, taken in a bad sense for cunning and wicked thoughts, <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span> so that the meaning, as I have noticed already, is this: Since the ungodly have the hardihood to devise and perpetrate every kind of wickedness, however atrocious, it is from this sufficiently manifest, that they have cast off all fear of God from their hearts. </p><p><strong>(200)</strong> The sentence in the Hebrew text is elliptical, and hence it has been variously translated. Literally it is, “No God all his thoughts.” The Syriac version renders it, “There is no God in all his thoughts.” The Septuagint reads, <span class="lang el-gr">Οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ θεὸς ἐνώπιον αὐτου</span>, “God is not before him.” <em>Mudge </em>renders it, “No God is all his wicked politics;” <em>Horsley</em>, “No God is the whole of his philosophy.” and <em>Fry</em>, “There is no Elohim is all his thought.” </p><p><strong>(201)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui nous le fait avoir en reverence et nous tient le subjets</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(202)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour meschantes et malicieuses pensees</span>.” — <em>Fr. </em>“Wicked and malicious thoughts.” </p></div>
