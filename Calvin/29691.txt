<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13</strong><em>And you, brethren</em>. Ambrose is of opinion that this is added lest the rich should, in a niggardly spirit, refuse to lend their aid to the poor, because he had exhorted them to <em>eat every one his own bread</em>. And, unquestionably, we see how many are unbefittingly ingenious in catching at a pretext for inhumanity. <span class="cite-ref">(724)</span> Chrysostom explains it thus — that indolent persons, however justly they may be condemned, must nevertheless be assisted when in want. I am simply of opinion, that Paul had it in view to provide against an occasion of offense, which might arise from the indolence of a few. For it usually happens, that those that are otherwise particularly ready and on the alert for beneficence, become cool on seeing that they have thrown away their favors by misdirecting them. Hence Paul admonishes us, that, although there are many that are undeserving, <span class="cite-ref">(725)</span> while others abuse our liberality, we must not on this account leave off helping those that need our aid. Here we have a statement worthy of being observed — that however ingratitude, moroseness, pride, arrogance, and other unseemly dispositions on the part of the poor, may have a tendency to annoy us, or to dispirit us, from a feeling of weariness, we must strive, nevertheless, never to leave off aiming at doing good. </p><p><strong>(724)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Enuers les poures</span>;” — “Towards the poor.” </p><p><strong>(725)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne meritent point qu’on leur face du bien</span>;” — “Do not deserve that any should do them good.” </p></div>
