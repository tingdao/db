<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>From whom took he counsel? </em>The Prophet expresses the same thing in many ways; that we may know that nothing is more foolish than man, <span class="cite-ref">(115)</span> when he ventures to lift himself up into heaven, to examine or judge by his own ability the works of God. In these words, therefore, Isaiah intended to repress more and more the insolence and rashness of men. Paul quotes this proof for the same purpose, to deter us from judging of the unsearchable counsel of God; for God does not wish us to inquire concerning his wisdom but in a sober and becoming manner. (<span class="bvs">Rom_11:34</span>.) There is one difference, that Paul affirms that the spiritual mystery of the gospel cannot be fathomed by the human understanding, while the Prophet pronounces a commendation, in general terms, on the providence of God. But on both points we ought to learn humility, and to bring all our senses captive to obedience. All the reason or understanding that we have is mere darkness, till we have been enlightened by Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(115)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que l’homme est plus beste que los bestes mesmes</span>.” “That man is more a beast than the beasts themselves.” </p></div></div>
