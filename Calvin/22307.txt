<div class="comment-content"><p>It now follows, <em>Alas the day! for nigh is the day of Jehovah. </em>Here the Prophet, as it was at first stated, threatens something worse in future than what they had experienced. He has hitherto been showing their torpidity; now he declares that they had not yet suffered all their punishments, but that there was something worse to be feared, except they turned seasonably to God. And he now exclaims, as though the day of Jehovah was before his eyes, and he calls it the day of Jehovah, because in that day God would stretch-forth his hand to execute judgment; for while he tolerates men or bears with their sins, he seems not to rule in the world. And though this mode of speaking is common enough in Scripture, it ought yet to be carefully noticed; for all seem not to understand that God calls that his own day, when he will openly shine forth and appear as the judge of the world: but as long as he spares us, his face seems to be hidden from us; yea, he seems not to govern the world. The Prophet therefore declares here that the day of the Lord was at hand; for it cannot be, but that the Lord must at length rise up and ascend his throne to punish men, though for a time he may connive at them. But the interjection, expressive of grief, intimates that the judgment, of which the Prophet speaks, was not to be despised, for it would be dreadful; and he wished to strike terror into the Jews, for they were too secure. And he says, <em>The day is nigh, </em>that they might not procrastinate, as they were wont to do, from day to day: for though men be touched by God’s judgments they yet even desire time to be prolonged to them, and they come very tardily to God. Hence the Prophet, that he might correct this their great slothfulness, says that the day was nigh. </p><p>He adds, <span class="lang he-il">כשד משדי יבוא</span><em>kashed meshadi ibu </em>‘as a desolation from the Almighty will it come.’ The word <span class="lang he-il">שדי</span><em>shadi </em>signifies a conqueror; but it proceeds from the verb <span class="lang he-il">שדד</span><em>shadad</em>; and this in Hebrew means “to desolate,” or “to destroy.” The powerful and the conqueror is called <span class="lang he-il">שדי</span><em>shadi</em>; and hence they call God <span class="lang he-il">שדי</span><em>shadi</em>, on account of his power. Some derive it from udder: then they call God <span class="lang he-il">שדי</span><em>shadi </em>as though Scripture gave him this name, because from him flows all abundance of good things as from a fountain. But I rather refer this name to his strength and power, for the Jews, we know, gloried in the name of God as one armed to defend their safety. Whenever then the Prophets said that God was <span class="lang he-il">שדי</span><em>shadi</em>, the people laid hold on this as a ground for false confidence, “God is almighty, we are then secure from all evils.” But yet this confidence was not founded on the promises: and it was, we know, an absurd and profane presumption to have thus abused the name of God. Since then the Jews foolishly pricked themselves on this, that God had adopted them for his people, the prophet says here, “There will come a desolation from the Almighty;” that is, “God is Almighty, but ye are greatly deceived in thinking that your safety is secured by his power; for he will, on the contrary, be opposed to you, inasmuch as ye have provoked his wrath.” It follows — </p></div>
