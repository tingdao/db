<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And that they might not be as their fathers, a rebellious and provoking generation. </em>The Psalmist here shows still more distinctly how necessary this sermon was, from the circumstance that the Jews were exceedingly prone to revolt from God, if they were not kept in subjection by powerful restraints. He takes it as a fact, which could not be questioned, that their hearts were in no respect better than the hearts of their fathers, whom he affirms to have been a treacherous, rebellious, crooked and disobedient race. They would, therefore, immediately backslide from the way of God, unless their hearts were continually sustained by stable supports. The experience of all ages shows that what Horace writes concerning his own nation is true every where: — </p><p><em>“ </em><em>Ætas parenturn, pejor avis, tulit </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Nos nequiores, mox daturos </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Progeniem vitiosiroem </em><em>.” </em><em><LineBreak /></em>Odes, <em>Book III. Ode vi. </em></p><p><em>“The age that gave our fathers birth, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Saw them their noble sires disgrace: </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>We, baser still, shall leave on earth </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>The still increasing guilt of our degenerate race.” </em><em><LineBreak /></em>Boscawen’Translation. </p><p>What then would be the consequence, did not God succor the world which thus proceeds from evil to worse? As the prophet teaches the Jews from the wickedness and perverseness of their fathers, that they stood in need of a severe discipline to recall them from the imitation of bad examples, we learn from this, how great the folly of the world is, in persuading itself that the example of the fathers is to be regarded as equivalent to a law, which ought, in every case, to be followed. He does not here speak of all people without distinction, but of the holy and chosen race of Abraham; nor does he rebuke a small number of persons, but almost the whole nation, among whom there prevailed excessive obstinacy, as well as perverse forgetfulness of the grace of God, and perfidious dissimulation. He does not mention merely the fathers of one age, but he comprehends a period stretching back into a remote antiquity, that persons may not take occasion to excuse themselves in committing sin, from the length of time during which it has prevailed. We must therefore make a wise selection from amongst the fathers of those whom it becomes us to imitate. It being a work of great difficulty to remove the disposition to this perverse imitation of the fathers, towards whom the feeling of reverence is naturally impressed on the minds of their successors, the prophet employs a multiplicity of terms to set forth the aggravated wickedness of the fathers, stigmatising them as chargeable with apostasy, provocation, treachery, and hypocrisy. These are very weighty charges; but it will be evident from the sequel that they are not exaggerated. The word <span class="lang he-il">הכין</span><em>, hechin, </em>which I have rendered <em>directed, </em>is by some translated <em>established, </em>but in my opinion, the meaning rather is, that God’s ancient people always turned aside from God into crooked by-paths. Also, in what follows, instead of reading <em>whose spirit was not faithful towards God, </em>some read <em>whose spirit leaned not upon God. </em><span class="cite-ref">(315)</span> But it is better to follow the former interpretation, That they were not faithfully and steadfastly devoted to God, although they had solemnly sworn allegiance to him. The Papists make use of this passage as an argument to prove that man has the power of bending his own heart, and directing it either to good or evil as he pleases; but this is an inference from it which cannot stand examination for a single moment. Although the prophet justly blames those who have not directed their heart aright, his object is not expressly to speak of what men can do of themselves. It is the special work of God to turn to himself the hearts of men by the secret influence of his Holy Spirit. It does not however follow from this, that they will be exempted from blame, when their own lust and depravity draw them away from God. Moreover, from the sins which are here reproved, we should learn in what way he would have us to obey and serve him. In the first place, we must lay aside all obstinacy and take his yoke upon us; <span class="cite-ref">(316)</span> and, secondly, we must clothe ourselves with the spirit of meekness, bring the affections of the heart to the obedience of God, and follow after uprightness, and that not with the fervor of a mere transient impulse, but with unfeigned and unwavering steadfastness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(315)</span> “The Syriac version reads, ‘And confided not in the God of its spirit,’ translating <span class="lang he-il">נאמנה</span>, [the word which Calvin renders ‘was faithful,’] by a masculine verb; and this indeed the sense will very well bear, and the change of genders is not unusual, and God is frequently known by that title, ‘the God of the spirits of all flesh.’ See <span class="bvs">Num_16:22</span>.” — <em>Hammond </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(316)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Premierement il faut que nous ostions toute obstination, avant que nous puissions avoir les cols propres pour recevoir son joug</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. In the first place, we must lay aside all obstinacy before we can bend our necks to receive his yoke. </p></div></div>
