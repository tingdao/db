<div class="comment-content"><p>A kind of theft is here condemned which is severely punished by the laws of Rome; <span class="cite-ref">(105)</span> for that every one’s property may be secure, it is necessary that the land-marks set up for the division of fields should remain untouched, as if they were sacred. He who fraudulently removes a landmark is already convicted by this very act, because he disturbs the lawful owner in his quiet possession of the land; <span class="cite-ref">(106)</span> whilst he who advances further the boundaries of his own land to his neighbor’s loss, doubles the crime by the deceptive concealment of his theft. Whence also we gather that not only are those thieves, who actually carry away their neighbor’s property, who take his money out of his chest, or who pillage his cellars and granaries, but also those who unjustly possess themselves of his land. </p><p><strong>(105)</strong> “In the digests there is a vague law, <em>de termino moto</em>, <em>Digestor</em>.
