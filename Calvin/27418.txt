<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>The multitude was divided. </em>The most troublesome part of the tragedy<span class="cite-ref">(9)</span> followeth now, for the city is divided into two parts; and at length Paul and Barnabas (being enforced by the uproar of the people) depart unto another place. If it be demanded what was the original of the discord, assuredly it flowed from the gospel, to which, notwithstanding, there is nothing more contrary than to cause discord; but the forwardness of men causeth that the gospel, which ought to be the bond of unity, is (so soon as it cometh abroad) the occasion of tumults. Wherefore, so soon as any schism ariseth, before we condemn those who seem to be the authors, it behoveth us wisely to consider who ought to bear the blame. We hear here that one city was divided,<span class="cite-ref">(10)</span> whereby some were brought unto Christ. The Spirit of God pronounceth this to the praise, and not the shame, of Paul and Barnabas. The same rule must we observe at this day, lest the gospel be burdened with false envy, if it bring not men together<span class="cite-ref">(11)</span> unto God, but the wicked rage against it. It is assuredly a miserable matter to see division among men. But as the unity is accursed which doth separate us all from God, so it were better that a few should depart an hundred times from all the whole world, and, in the mean season, come in favor again with God, than that disagreeing with him continually, they should have peace with the world.<span class="cite-ref">(12)</span></p><p><strong>(9)</strong></p><p>“ Catastrophe,” the catastrophe. </p><p><strong>(10)</strong></p><p>“ Schismate,” by a schism. </p><p><strong>(11)</strong></p><p>“ Omnes pariter,” all alike. </p><p><strong>(12)</strong></p><p>“ Mundi pac.” </p></div>
