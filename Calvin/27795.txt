Wherefore, he did not doubt but that many of his friends would willingly bestow cost to redeem him.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(594)</span></p><p>“ Liberationes redimendae,” of purchasing deliverance. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(595)</span></p><p>“ Ut sagaces sunt et acuti qui jus habent venale,” as those judges who act ve-nally are sagacious and acute </p><p><span class="cite-note">(596)</span></p><p>“ Aliquid procul de ipso subodoratum esse,” he had some distant idea of what kind of a person he was. </p></div></div>
