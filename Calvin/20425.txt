When, therefore, the tongue of a child clave to his mouth, it seemed to be in a manner beyond nature. Among other calamities, then, the Prophet names this, that <em>infants pined away with thirst, </em>and also that <em>children sought bread </em>in vain. He speaks not in the latter instance of sucklings, but. of children three or four years old. Then he says that they <em>sought </em>or asked for bread, but that there was no one to give. <span class="cite-ref">(210)</span></p><p>He describes here the famine of the city, of which he had predicted, when he declared that it would be better with the slain than with the people remaining alive, for a harder conflict with famine and want would await the living. But this was not believed. Now, then, the Prophet upbraids the Jews with their former perverseness. He afterwards adds, — </p><p><strong>(210)</strong> The verbs here are in the past tense, and not in the present, as in our version, — </p><p>Cleave did the tongue of the suckling <LineBreak />To his palate through thirst; <LineBreak />Children asked bread, <LineBreak />A breaker, none <em>was </em>to them. </p><p>— <em>Ed </em></p></div>
