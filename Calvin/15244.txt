<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>For, behold! thy enemies are tumultuous. </em>As an argument for enforcing the prayer of the preceding verse, it is affirmed that the faithful are oppressed both by the impetuous violence and the crafty policy of their enemies, which, to all human appearance, rendered their escape from death utterly hopeless. When it is said that <em>they are tumultuous </em>and <em>lift up the head, </em>the meaning is, that relying upon their own power, they behave themselves insolently and proudly. By this conduct on the part of their enemies, the minds of the people of God are greatly depressed, and the only way in which they can obtain relief, is by making their moan to Him whose continual work it is to repress the proud. When, therefore, the saints implore his aid, it is their ordinary course to lay before him the perverseness of their enemies. It is worthy of notice, that those who molest the Church are called <em>the enemies of God. </em></p><p>It affords us no small ground of confidence that those who are our enemies are also God’s enemies. This is one of the fruits of his free and gracious covenant, in which he has promised to be an enemy to all our enemies, — a promise for which there is good cause, when it is considered that the welfare of his people, whom he has taken under his protection, cannot be assailed without an injury being, at the same the done to his own majesty. Meanwhile, let us live at peace with all men, as much as in us lies, and let us endeavor to practice uprightness in our whole deportment, that we may be able confidently to appeal to God, that when we suffer at the hands of men, we suffer wrongfully. The pride and violent assaults of our enemies may be combined with craftiness. But when such is the case, it becomes us to yield to God the honor which belongs to him, by resting satisfied that He can succor us; for to break the proud who foam out their rage, and to take the crafty in their own craftiness, is work which He has been accustomed to perform in all ages. To keep us from thinking that we are abandoned to the snares and traps of our enemies, the prophet here seasonably sets before us a consideration calculated to administer the highest consolation and hope, when he calls us <em>God’s hidden ones </em>This expression is understood by some as meaning that the aid and protection which God extends to us, is not apparent to the eye of sense and reason; just as it is said elsewhere of the life of the people of God, that it is <em>hid, </em>(<span class="bvs">Col_3:3</span>.) But this interpretation is too forced, and altogether inconsistent both with the scope of the passage and the natural construction of the words. The design of them is simply to teach that we are hidden under the shadow of God’s wings; for although to outward appearance we lie open, and are exposed to the will of the wicked and the proud, we are preserved by the hidden power of God. <span class="cite-ref">(432)</span> Accordingly, it is said in another Psalm, (27:5,) </p><p>“In the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_27:5</span>) </p><p>It is, however, at the same time to be observed, that none are hid under the keeping and protection of God but those who, renouncing all dependence on their own strength, betake themselves with fear and trembling to Him. Such as under the influence of a flattering belief in the sufficiency of their own strength to resist, boldly enter the conflict, and, as if devoid of all fear, wax wanton, will ultimately suffer the consequences which result from inadequate resources. <span class="cite-ref">(433)</span> We will then best consult our own safety by taking shelter under the shadow of the Almighty, and, conscious of our own weakness, committing our salvation to him, casting it, so to speak, into his bosom. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(432)</span> The Hebrew word translated <em>thy hidden ones</em>, primarily means a <em>treasure</em>, and is so taken in <span class="bvs">Psa_17:14</span>. Accordingly, it is here rendered by Mudge, and French and Skinner, “thy treasured ones:” that is, thy peculiar people: those whom thou hast hitherto protected and kept in perfect safety, as in a place of security and secrecy. The Septuagint reads, <span class="lang el-gr">κατὰ τῶν ἁγίων σου</span>, “against thy saints.” The word is also sometimes put for the sanctuary, as in <span class="bvs">Eze_7:22</span>. Some therefore think that the temple, and the treasures contained in it, are intended. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(433)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils sentiront a la fin a leur grande honte, qu’ils estoyent desnuer de toute vertu</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “Will at length find, to their great shame, that they were destitute of all power.” </p></div></div>
