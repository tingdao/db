<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet speaks first without a figure, then he illustrates the simple truth by a metaphor. He says that there was <em>no one to undertake the cause </em>of the people; as though he had said, that they were destitute of every aid. This was, indeed, in a measure already evident; but so supine was the security of the people, that they daily formed for themselves some new hopes. Then Jeremiah declared what had already in part happened and was still impending; and thus he proved the folly of the people, who still flattered themselves while they were involved in evils almost without a remedy. “Thou seest,” he says, “that there is no one to stretch forth a hand to thee, or who is ready to help thee; and yet thou thinkest that thou wilt soon be free: whence is this vain expectation?” He then comes to a metaphor, <em>There is no one to apply medicine for thy healing </em>In one sentence he includes the whole first chapter of Isaiah, who handles the subject, but explains more fully his meaning. There is, however, nothing obscure when the Prophet says that there was no one to heal the evils of the people. <span class="cite-ref">(10)</span></p><p>We must ever bear in mind his object, that is, that the people were too easily deceived, when they hoped to return shortly to their own country. But we may hence gather a general truth, — that men never understand the favor of God until they are subdued by many and severe reproofs: for they always shun God’s judgment, and then they become blind to their own sins, and foolishly flatter themselves. And, further, when they only in words confess that they have sinned, they think that they have done abundantly enough. They ought therefore to be urged to the practice and duty of repentance. It afterwards follows — </p><p><strong>(10)</strong> According to <em>Calvin, </em>the verse reads thus, — </p><p>No one undertakes thy cause; For a cure, medicines and healing thou hast not. </p><p>This division is made by the <em>Sept., </em>though not by the other versions, nor the <em>Targ. Venema </em>adopts it. The word <span class="lang he-il">מזור</span>, rendered above “cure,” means evidently a wound. It only occurs here, and <span class="bvs">Oba_1:7</span>, and twice in <span class="bvs">Hos_5:13</span>, where it is rendered “wound.” It comes from <span class="lang he-il">זור</span>, in the sense of compressing or binding up; but the noun taken passively, signifies what is compressed or bound up, and that is a wound. Then the literal rendering would be — </p><p>None <em>is </em>pleading thy cause; As to the wound, medicatives, binding up, none to thee; </p><p><em>or in other words, </em>— </p><p>As to the wound, thou hast no medicatives, no binding up. </p><p>The word <span class="lang he-il">רפאות</span> means medicatives or medicaments, rather than medicines, as it designates here, and in most places, outward applications to wounds and bruises. The order, as in the foregoing verse, is reversed, the medicaments are put before the binding up. See <span class="bvs">Eze_30:21</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
