<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>140.</strong><em>Thy word is exceedingly refined. </em>In this verse he intimates that the cause of his zeal was the love which he bore to heavenly doctrine. For to be displeased with or severely to condemn the contempt of divine truth, unless we are bound to it by the cords of love, is pure hypocrisy. And he affirms that his love to God’s word was not a rash, or a blind and inconsiderate affection, but that he loved it, because like gold or silver which has been refined, it was pure and free from all dregs and dross. This is the idea contained in the metaphorical term <span class="lang he-il">צרופה</span><em>, tseruphah, </em>translated <em>refined; </em><span class="cite-ref">(18)</span> and though it seems to be commonplace, yet, vindicating God’s word from all perverse and malicious judgments, it expresses graphically the true obedience of faith. How few are there who are not guilty, either by their distrust, or waywardness, or pride, or voluptuousness, of casting upon God’s word some spot or stain! The flesh then being so rebellious, it is no small commendation of revealed truth, when it is compared to gold well refined, so that it shines pure from all defilement. Farther, it serves not a little to show the truth of this testimony, that the Prophet confirms it by his own experience. The more effectually to repress the foolish rashness with which we are chargeable whenever we imagine that there is any fault in God’s word, he declares that in commending it he gives utterance to the unfeigned feeling of his heart, having experienced a blissful pleasure in that purity of which he speaks. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(18)</span> Dr. Adam Clarke translates <span class="lang he-il">צרופה</span>, <em>tseruphah, </em>by <em>purification. </em>This rendering conveys a beautiful idea. God’s word is not only <em>a purified thing, </em>but <em>a thing that purifies. </em>It cleanses from sin every heart with which it comes into contact. </p><p>“Now ye are clean,” said Christ, <LineBreak />“by the word which I have spoken unto you.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_15:3</span>.) </p><p>This tendency of the word to impart a measure of its own purity to such as yield to its influence, endears it to all God’s people; and for this reason they make it the subject of their constant meditation. </p></div></div>
