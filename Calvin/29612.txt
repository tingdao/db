<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>As to brotherly love</em>. Having previously, in lofty terms, commended their love, he now speaks by way of <em>anticipation</em>, saying, <em>ye need not that I write to you</em>. He assigns a reason — <em>because they had been divinely taught </em>— by which he means that love was engraven upon their hearts, so that there was no need of letters written on paper. For he does not mean simply what John says in his first Canonical <span class="cite-ref">(571)</span> Epistle, <em>the anointing will teach you</em>, (<span class="bvs">1Jo_2:27</span>) but that their hearts were framed for love; so that it appears that the Holy Spirit inwardly dictates efficaciously what is to be done, so that there is no need to give injunctions in writing. He subjoins an argument from the greater to the less; for as their love diffuses itself through the whole of Macedonia, he infers that it is not to be doubted that they <em>love one another</em>. Hence the particle <em>for </em>means <em>likewise</em>, or <em>nay more</em>, for, as I have already stated, he adds it for the sake of greater intensity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(571)</span> The Epistles of John, along with those of James, Peter, and Jude, “were termed <em>Canonical </em>by Cassiodorus in the middle of the sixth century, and by the writer of the prologue to these Epistles, which is erroneously ascribed to Jerome.... Du Pin says that some Latin writers have called these Epistles <em>Canonical</em>, either confounding the name with Catholic, or to denote that they are a part of the <em>Canon </em>of the books of the New Testament.” —<em>Horne’s </em>Introduction, vol. 4, p. 409. On the origin and import of the epithet <em>General</em>, or <em>Catholic</em>, usually applied to these Epistles, the reader will find some valuable observations in <em>Brown’s </em>Expository Discourses on Peter, vol. 1. </p></div></div>
