<div class="comment-content"><p>It was no useless repetition when the Prophet said so often that <em>God said. </em>He might have said only, “Behold, a nation shall come from the north;” but he premises by saying that he derived this message from God, and not only so, but he introduces God as the speaker, that his message might be more impressive. In the former verse he had also said, <em>Thus saith Jehovah, </em>and elsewhere: but he now repeats the same words, that the holy name of God might more powerfully rouse their minds. </p><p><em>Behold, </em>he says, <em>a people shall come from the land of the north </em>For forty years Jeremiah ceased not to proclaim war against the Jews, and also openly to name their enemies: we yet see that so much preaching was without fruit. This was dreadful indeed: but we may thus see, as it were in a mirror, how great is our hardness and stupor, and how great is our fury and madness against God. He then designates here the Chaldeans as a <em>northern nation, </em>and says that it was a <em>great nation: </em>and yet he shews, that the Chaldeans would not of themselves come; it <em>shall be roused, </em>he says. This act is to be applied to God; for though ambition and avarice impelled the Chaldeans to lay waste nations and lands far and wide, yet that war was carried on under the guidance of God himself: he armed and impelled the Chaldeans, and used them as the scourges of his wrath. We may learn this from the verb <span class="lang he-il">יעור</span>, <em>iour, “ </em>shall be roused;” and he says, from <em>the sides of the earth, </em><span class="cite-ref">(181)</span> for they came from a distant country. But the Prophet means, that there would be nothing to hinder the Chaldeans from entering Judea, and from destroying and putting to flight the people, and from demolishing the city and the temple. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(181)</span> The ancient versions render it, “from the end, or ends, or extremities, of the earth.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
