<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet now explains what we have stated respecting plunder and fraud. He confirms that he had not without reason called Jerusalem <span class="lang he-il">היונה</span>, <em>eiune</em>, a rapacious city, or one given to plunder; for the princes were like lions and the judges like wolves. And when he speaks of judges, he does not spare the common people; but he shows that all orders were then corrupt: for though no justice or equity is regarded by the people, there will yet remain some shame among the judges, so as to retain the people at least within some limits, that an extreme licentiousness may not prevail: but when robbery is practiced in the court of justice, what can be said of such a city? We hence see that the Prophet in these words describes an extreme confusion: The princes of Jerusalem, he says, are lions. And we have elsewhere similar declarations; for the Prophets, when it was their object to condemn all from the least to the greatest, did yet direct their discourse especially to the judges. </p><p>And this is worthy of being noticed, for there was then no Church of God, except at Jerusalem. Yet the Prophet says, that the judges, and prophets, and priests, were all apostates. What comfort could the faithful have had? But we hence see that the fear of God had not wholly failed in his elect, and that they firmly and with an invincible heart contended against all offenses and trials of this kind. Let us also learn to fortify ourselves at this day with the same courage, so that we may not faint, however much impiety may everywhere prevail, and all religion may seem extinct among men. </p><p>But we may also hence learn, how foolishly the Papists pride themselves in their vain titles, as though they thought that God was bound as it were to them, because they have bishops and pastors. But the Prophet shows, that even those who performed the ordinary office of executing the laws could yet be the wicked and perfidious despisers of God. He also shows, that neither prophets nor priests ought to be spared; for when God sets them over his Church, he gives them no power to tyrannize, so that they might dare to do anything with impunity, and not be reproved. For though the priesthood under the law was sacred, we yet see that it was subject to correction. So let no one at this day claim for himself a privilege, as though he was exempt from all instruction and reproof, while occupying a high station among the people of God. </p><p>He distinguishes between princes and judges; and the reason is, because the kingdom was as yet standing. So the courtiers, who were in favor and authority with the king, drew a part of the spoil to themselves, and the judges devoured another part. Though Scripture often makes no difference between these two names, yet I doubt not but he means by <span class="lang he-il">שרים</span>, <em>sherim</em>, princes, the chiefs who were courtiers; and he calls them <span class="lang he-il">שפטים</span>, <em>shepthim</em>, judges, who administered justice. And he says that the judges were evening wolves, that is, hungry, for wolves become furious in the evening when they have been roaming about all day and have found nothing. As their want sharpens the savageness of wolves, so the Prophet says that the judges were hungry like evening wolves, whose hunger renders them furious. And for the same purpose he adds, that they <em>broke not the bones in the morning</em>; that is, they waited not till the dawn to break the bones; <span class="cite-ref">(107)</span> for when they devoured the flesh they also employed their teeth in breaking the bones, because their voracity was so great. We now apprehend the Prophet’s meaning. It afterwards follows— </p><p><strong>(107)</strong> This is the explanation of <em>Grotius</em>, <em>Mede</em>, and <em>Henderson</em>. The latter’s version is—“They gnaw no bones in the morning;” <em>i.e.</em>, all is devoured in the night. <em>Newcome</em>, adopting the conjecture of <em>Houbigant, </em>supposes the true reading to be [<span class="lang he-il">ידמו</span> ], and gives this rendering—“They wait not until the morning,” which seems to have no meaning in this connection. What <em>Cocceius </em>proposes is more probable—“Who have not gnawed in the morning;” and on this account they were exceedingly voracious in the evening. But the idea of our common version is very appropriate; it implies that they were like wild beasts prowling all night, and carrying as it were their prey to their dens, that they might devour it there in the morning. This is the view taken by <em>Henry. </em>“They devour the flesh,” says Adam <em>Clarke</em>, “in the night, and gnaw the bones, and extract the marrow afterwards.”—<em>Ed. </em></p></div>
