<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Lo! surely, thus blessed shall be the man who feareth Jehovah. </em>The preceding doctrine, that even in the outward condition of God’s servants while in this transitory state there is afforded such evidence of the divine favor and goodness as demonstrates that we do not lose our labor in serving him, is here confirmed by the Prophet. Yet as the reward of godliness does not appear eminently conspicuous, he, in the first place, uses the demonstrative particle, <em>Lo! </em><span class="cite-ref">(107)</span> and then adds <em>surely; </em>for so I interpret the particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, <em>ki. </em>We must, however, always remember, as I have previously noticed, that the divine blessing is promised to us upon earth in such a way as that it may not engross our thoughts and keep them grovelling in the dust; for it is not meet that our hope of the life to come should be stifled. This is the reason why we do not at all times equally enjoy the benefits of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(107)</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Il use en premier lieu d’un mot qui est commoe pour demonstrer la chose au doigt ou a l’oeil, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">voyla </em> —<em>Fr. </em>“He, in the first place, uses a word, which is, as it were, to point to the thing with the finger, or show it to the eye<em>, Lo! </em>” </p></div></div>
