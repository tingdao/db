<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>God brouqht them out of Egypt. </em>He assigns a reason for their constant success, <em>i.e., </em>because God has once redeemed this people, He will not forsake the work which He has begun. The argument is drawn from the continued course of Godâ€™s blessings; for, since they flow from an inexhaustible fountain, their progress is incessant. This, however, specially refers to the state of the Church, for He will never cease to be gracious to His children, until He has led them to the very end of their course. Rightly, therefore, does Balaam conclude that, because God has once redeemed His people, He will be the perpetual guardian of their welfare. He afterwards teaches that the power wherewith God defends His people shall be invincible, for this is the meaning of the similitude of the unicorn. </p></div>
