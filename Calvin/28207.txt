<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>But I say, has not Israel known? </em>This objection of an opponent is taken from the comparison of the less with the greater. Paul had argued, that the Gentiles were not to be excluded from the knowledge of God, since he had from the beginning manifested himself to them, though only obscurely and through shadows, or had at least given them some knowledge of his truth. What then is to be said of Israel, who had been illuminated by a far different light of truth? for how comes it that aliens and the profane should run to the light manifested to them afar off, and that the holy race of Abraham should reject it when familiarly seen by them? For this distinction must be ever borne in mind, “What nation is so renowned, that it has gods coming nigh to it, as thy God at this day descends to thee?” It was not then without reason asked, why knowledge had not followed the doctrine of the law, with which Israel was favored. </p><p><em>First, Moses saith, etc. </em>He proves by the testimony of Moses, that there was nothing inconsistent in God in preferring the Gentiles to the Jews. The passage is taken from that celebrated song, in which God, upbraiding the Jews with their perfidiousness, declares, that he would execute vengeance on them, and provoke them to jealousy by taking the Gentiles into covenant with himself, because they had departed to fictitious gods. “Ye have,” he says, “by despising and rejecting me, transferred my right and honor to idols: to avenge this wrong, I will also substitute the Gentiles in your place, and I will transfer to them what I have hitherto given to you.” Now this could not have been without repudiating the Jewish nation: for the emulation, which Moses mentions, arose from this, — that God formed for himself a nation from that which was not a nation, and raised up from nothing a new people, who were to occupy the place from which the Jews had been driven away, inasmuch as they had forsaken the true God and prostituted themselves to idols. For though, at the coming of Christ, the Jews were not gone astray to gross and external idolatry, they had yet no excuse, since they had profaned the whole worship of God by their inventions; yea, they at length denied God the Father, as revealed in Christ, his only-begotten Son, which was an extreme kind of impiety. </p><p>Observe, that a <em>foolish nation, </em>and <em>no nation, </em>are the same; for without the hope of eternal life men have properly no existence. Besides, the beginning or origin of life is from the light of faith: hence spiritual existence flows from the new creation; and in this sense Paul calls the faithful the work of God, as they are regenerated by his Spirit, and renewed after his image. Now from the word <em>foolish, </em>we learn that all the wisdom of men, apart from the word of God, is mere vanity. <span class="cite-ref">(335)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(335)</span> The quotation is from <span class="bvs">Deu_32:21</span>, and it is literally the Hebrew as well as the <em>Septuagint</em>, except that “you” is put for “them.” The contrast in Hebrew is very striking; the whole verse is this, — </p><p><span class="cite-note">21.</span>They have made me jealous by a no-God,<span class="cite-ref"><LineBreak /></span>They have provoked me by their foolish idols;<span class="cite-ref"><LineBreak /></span>And I will make them jealous by a no-people,<span class="cite-ref"><LineBreak /></span>By a foolish nation will I provoke them. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
