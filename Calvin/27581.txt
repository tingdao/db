<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>A certain Jew. </em>This ought for good causes to be ascribed to the providence of God, in that whilst Paul is enforced to depart from Ephesus, Apollos cometh in his place to supply his absence. And it is very expedient to know the beginning of this man of what sort it was, forasmuch as he was Paul’s successor among the Corinthians, and did behave himself so excellently, and did his faithful endeavor, and took great pains, so that Paul commendeth him honorably as a singular fellow in office.</p><p>“I have planted, (saith he,) Apollos hath watered,” <LineBreak />( <span class="bvs">1Co_3:6</span>.)</p><p>Also, these things have I figuratively appointed unto myself and Apollos, ( <span class="bvs">1Co_4:6</span>.) Luke giveth him first two titles of commendation, that he was eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures; afterward he will add his zeal, faith, and constancy. And though Paul do truly deny that the kingdom of God consisteth in words, and he himself was not commended for eloquence yet dexterity in speaking and reasoning<span class="cite-ref">(341)</span> (such as Luke doth here commend) is not to be despised, especially when no pomp or vain boasting is sought after, by using fine words and great eloquence; but he which is to teach counteth it sufficient for him, without fraud or ambition, without lofty words and curious cunning, plainly to lay open the matter he hath in hand. Paul was without eloquence; the Lord would have the chief apostle to want this virtue, to the end the power of the Spirit might appear more excellent in his rude and homely speech. And yet was he furnished with such eloquence as was sufficient to set forth the name of Christ, and to maintain the doctrine of salvation. But as the distribution of the gifts of the Spirit is divers and manifold, Paul’s infancy,<span class="cite-ref">(342)</span> that I may so call it, did no whit let but that the Lord might choose to himself eloquent ministers. Furthermore, lest any man should think that Apollos’ eloquence was profane or vain,<span class="cite-ref">(343)</span> Luke saith that it was joined with great power,<span class="cite-ref">(344)</span> namely, that he was mighty in the Scriptures. Which I expound thus, that he was not only well and soundly exercised in the Scriptures, but that he had the force and efficacy thereof, that, being armed with them, he did in all conflicts get the upper hand. And this (in my judgment) is rather the praise of the Scripture than of man,<span class="cite-ref">(345)</span> that it hath sufficient force both to defend the truth, and also to refute the subtilty of Satan.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(341)</span></p><p>“ Sermocinandi,” sermonising, haranguing. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(342)</span></p><p>“ Pauli infantia,” Paul’s want of utterance. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(343)</span></p><p>“ Vel inanem et fulinem,” or futile and vain. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(344)</span></p><p>“ Cum majore...virtute,” with a greater virtue or excellence. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(345)</span></p><p>“ Scripturae potius quam hominis laus est,” is greater prase to Scripture than to the man. </p></div></div>
