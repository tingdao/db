<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And when they had found disciples. </em>Though the number of the faithful was but small, yet there came some seed of the gospel thither, according to the prophecies Of the prophets, ( <span class="bvs">Isa_23:18</span>) lest Tyrus should be altogether void of the blessing of God. And here, as in other places going before, Luke calleth Christians disciples, that we may know that those alone are numbered in the flock of Christ who have embraced his doctrine by faith. For that is a vain<span class="cite-ref">(455)</span> and false profession for a man to give his name to Christ, and not to understand what he teacheth or speaketh. And let the readers mark, that Paul stayed seven days at Tyrus, for no other cause, saving that he might strengthen them. So that we see, that whithersoever he came he foreslowed [neglected] no occasion to do good.</p><p><em>They said by the Spirit. </em>Namely, with the approbation of speech, that Paul might know that they spake by the Spirit of prophecy. Surely this was no small temptation to cause him not to finish the journey which he had taken in hand, seeing the Holy Ghost did dissuade him from the same. And this was a very fair color<span class="cite-ref">(456)</span> to fly from the cross, if he had cared for his own safety, to be drawn back as it were with the hand of God.</p><p>Notwithstanding, he ceaseth not to hold on thither whither he knew he was called by the Lord. Notwithstanding, here ariseth a question, how the brethren can dissuade him by the Spirit from doing that which Paul did testify he doth by the secret motion of the same Spirit? Is the Spirit contrary to himself, that he doth now loose Paul whom he held bound inwardly? I answer, that there be diverse gifts of the Spirit; so that it is no marvel if those who excel in the gift of prophecy be sometimes destitute of judgment or strength.<span class="cite-ref">(457)</span> The Lord showed to these brethren, of whom Luke maketh mention, what should come to pass; yet, nevertheless, they know not what is expedient, and what Paul’s calling doth require, because the measure of their gift doth not reach so far. And the Lord would have his servant admonished of purpose, partly, that through long meditation, he might be better furnished and prepared to suffer whatsoever should come, partly that his constancy might more plainly appear, when as being certified by prophecies of the doleful event, he doth, notwithstanding, wittingly and willingly, make haste to endure whatsoever things shall befall him.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(455)</span></p><p>“ Lusoria,” elusory. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(456)</span></p><p>“ Color apprime speciosus,” a very specious pretext. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(457)</span></p><p>“ Fortitudine,” fortitude. </p></div></div>
