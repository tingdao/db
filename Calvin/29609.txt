<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>Let no man oppress. </em>Here we have another exhortation, which flows, like a stream, from the doctrine of sanctification. “God,” says he, “has it in view to sanctify us, <em>that no man may do injury to his brother</em>. ” For as to Chrysostom’s connecting this statement with the preceding one, and explaining <span class="lang el-gr">ὑπερβαίνειν καὶ πλεονεκτεῖν</span> to mean — neighing after the wives of others, (<span class="bvs">Jer_5:8</span>) and eagerly desiring them, is too forced an exposition. Paul, accordingly, having adduced one instance of unchastity in respect of lasciviousness and lust, teaches that this also is a department of holiness — that we conduct ourselves righteously and harmlessly towards our neighbors. The <em>former </em>verb refers to violent oppressions — where the man that has more power emboldens himself to inflict injury. The <em>latter </em>includes in it all immoderate and unrighteous desires. As, however, mankind, for the most part, indulge themselves in lust and avarice, he reminds them of what he had formerly taught — that <em>God would be the avenger of all such things</em>. We must observe, however, what he says — we have <em>solemnly testified; </em><span class="cite-ref">(569)</span> for such is the sluggishness of mankind, that, unless they are wounded to the quick, they are touched with no apprehension of God’s judgment. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(569)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nous vous auons testifié et comme adjuré</span>;” — “We have testified to you, and, as it were, adjured.” </p></div></div>
