<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>The sin of their mouth, the words of their lips </em>Some interpreters read, <em>for, </em>or, <em>on account of the sin of their mouth, </em><span class="cite-ref">(369)</span> supplying the causal particle, that the words may be the better connected with the preceding verse. And there can be no doubt that the reason is stated here why they deserved to be subjected to constant wanderings and disquietude. The words as they stand, however, although abrupt and elliptical, well express the meaning which David would convey; as if he had said, that no lengthened proof was necessary to convict them of sin, which plainly showed itself in the mischievous tendency of their discourse. Wickedness, he tells us, proceeded from their mouth., They vomited out their pride and cruelty. That this is the sense in which we are to understand the words, is confirmed by what immediately follows — <em>Let them be taken in their pride. </em>He here points to the source of that insolence which led them with such proud and contumelious language, and in such a shameless manner, to oppress the innocent. He then specifies the sin of their lips, adding, that <em>they spoke words of cursing and falsehood </em>By this he means that their mouth was continually filled with horrid imprecations, and that they were wholly addicted to deceit and to calumniating. <span class="cite-ref">(370)</span> Those have mistaken the meaning of David who give a passive signification to the word which I have translated <em>to speak, </em>and understand him as saying that the wicked would be accounted examples of divine vengeance, the plain and notorious marks of which were written upon them. </p><p><strong>(369)</strong> This is the reading adopted by Jerome, and also by Horsley, who remarks, that in Jerome’s copies the words, “sin” and “discourse,” had certainly the preposition <span class="lang he-il">כ</span> prefixed. </p><p><strong>(370)</strong> The Syriac translation of the first part of the verse is, “The discourse of their mouth is the sin of their lips.” That is, whatever their lips speak is sin; so many words, so many sins. </p></div>
