<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Therefore I will wait for the Lord. </em><span class="cite-ref">(132)</span> I have chosen to render the particle <span class="lang he-il">ו</span> (<em>vau</em>) by <em>therefore</em>; for the Prophet recovers himself, after having received from the Lord the consolation which we have just now seen. “Seeing that the Lord is pleased to have disciples to whom his doctrine is sealed, <em>I will wait for him</em>, though <em>he hath hid his face from Jacob</em>, that is, hath rejected and cast off his people.” This is a remarkable passage, and, by meditating continually on it, we must be greatly encouraged; for though it may seem as if the whole world had revolted, still we ought boldly to persevere; and even though God <em>hath hid his face </em>from his people, and they who professed his name have been cast off, still we ought to <em>wait for him </em>with unshaken hope. This is the only remedy that is left to us. </p><p>The word <em>wait </em>is exceedingly emphatic; as if he had said, “Still I will not turn aside from God, I will persevere in faith.” He increases the force of it by adding, <em>I will look for him</em>; for the occurrence of any offense is wont to make our faith waver and faint, and it is most grievously shaken when we see that we are deprived of allies, and that there are open enemies who boldly take to themselves the name of the Church. Offenses commonly turn us aside from God, and perplex us in such a manner that we call in question the truth of the word. This consolation is therefore highly necessary, whether the Church is oppressed by outward calamities, or thrown into confusion by the treachery of the multitude. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(132)</span> And <em>I will wait for the </em>Lord. — Eng.
