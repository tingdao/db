<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>And, lo, a woman who had been afflicted with a bloody flux. </em>For <em>twelve successive years </em>the <em>bloody flux </em>had lasted, and the woman was so far from being negligent in seeking remedies, that <em>she had spent all her substance on physicians </em>All this is expressly stated by the Evangelists, that the miracle may shine with brighter glory. When an incurable disease was removed so suddenly, and by the mere touch of a garment, it is perfectly obvious that it was not accomplished by human power. The thought of the woman that, <em>if she only touched </em>Christ’s garment, she would immediately be cured, arose from an extraordinary impulse of the Holy Spirit, and ought not to be regarded as a general rule. We know how eagerly superstition is wont to sport in foolish and thoughtless attempts to copy the saints; but they are apes, and not imitators, who take up some remarkable example without the command of God, and are led rather by their own senses than by the direction of the Spirit. </p><p>It is even possible that there was a mixture of sin and error in the woman’s <em>faith, </em>which Christ graciously bears and forgives. Certainly, when she afterwards thinks that she has done wrong, and <em>fears and trembles, </em>there is no apology for that kind of doubt: for it is opposed to faith. Why did she not rather go straight to Christ? If her reverence for him prevented, from what other source than from his mercy did she expect aid? How comes it, then, that she is afraid of offending him, if she was convinced of his favorable regard? </p><p>Yet Christ bestows high commendation on her faith. This agrees with what I have lately noticed, that God deals kindly and gently with his people, — accepts their faith, though imperfect and weak, — and does not lay to their charge the faults and imperfections with which it is connected. It was by the guidance of faith, therefore, that the woman approached to Christ. When she stopped at the garment, instead of presenting herself in prayers that she might be cured, inconsiderate zeal may have drawn her a little aside from the right path; particularly as she soon afterwards shows that she had made the attempt with some degree of doubt and uncertainty. Were we even to grant that this was suggested to her by the Spirit, it still remains a fixed rule, that our faith must not be driven hither and thither by particular examples, but ought to rest wholly on the word of God, according to the saying of Paul, <em>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_10:17</span>.) This is a highly necessary warning, that we may not dignify with the name of faith any opinion which has been rashly embraced. </p></div>
