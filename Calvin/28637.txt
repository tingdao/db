<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Wherefore I give you to know. </em>Having admonished them from their own experience, he sets before them a general doctrine, which he deduces from it; for what the Corinthians had experienced in themselves is common to all mankind — to wander on in error, <span class="cite-ref">(729)</span> previously to their being brought back, through the kindness of God, into the way of truth. Hence it is necessary that we should be directed by the Spirit of God, or we shall wander on for ever. From this, too, it follows, that all things that pertain to the true knowledge of God, are the gifts of the Holy Spirit,. He at the same time derives an argument from opposite causes to opposite effects. <em>No one, speaking by the Spirit of God, can revile Christ; </em>so, on the other hand, <em>no one can speak well of Christ, but by the Spirit of Christ. </em>To <em>say that Jesus is accursed </em>is utter blasphemy against him. To <em>say that Jesus is the Lord, </em>is to speak of him in honorable terms and with reverence, and to extol his majesty. </p><p>Here it is asked — “As the wicked sometimes speak of Christ in honorable and magnificent terms, is this an indication that they have the Spirit of God?” I answer — “They undoubtedly have, so far as that effect is concerned; but the gift of regeneration is one thing, and the gift of bare intelligence, with which Judas himself was endowed, when he preached the gospel, is quite another.” Hence, too, we perceive how great our weakness is, as we cannot so much as move our tongue for the celebration of God’s praise, unless it be governed by his Spirit. Of this the Scripture, also, frequently reminds us, and the saints everywhere acknowledge that unless the Lord open their mouths, they are not fit to be the heralds of his praise. Among others, Isaiah says — I am a man of unclean lips, etc. (<span class="bvs">Isa_6:5</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(729)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’estre errans et abusez en diuerses sortes</span>;” — “To be wandering and deluded in various ways.” </p></div></div>
