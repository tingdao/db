<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Serving the Lord. </em>He reckoneth up first not only in what straits he was, but most of all his humility, coupled with contempt of the world, and rebukes, and other afflictions; as if he should say <em>, </em>that he was not honorably received or with commendation; but he was conversant among them under the contemptible form of the cross. And this is no small trial,<span class="cite-ref">(413)</span> when we faint not, though we see ourselves trodden under foot by the intolerable pride of the world.</p><p>Notwithstanding, we must note everything more distinctly. To serve the Lord is taken in this place, not for to worship God in holiness and righteousness, which is common to all the godly; but it doth signify to execute a public function. Therefore, Paul doth not speak of [as] some one private man, but as one made a minister of the Church. And so he doth testify, that he fulfilled the apostleship to him committed with humility and modesty; both because, knowing his own infirmity, he did mistrust himself; and also, because, considering the excellency of his calling, he counted himself very unmeet;<span class="cite-ref">(414)</span> and, lastly, because he did willingly submit himself to bear the reproach of the cross. For this humility is set both against vain confidence, and also haughtiness. Secondly, he toucheth<span class="cite-ref">(415)</span> his tears, which strifes, diverse assaults of Satan, the rage of wicked men, the inward diseases of the Church, and offenses, had made him shed; at length, he addeth, that he led a fearful life,<span class="cite-ref">(416)</span> amidst the layings in wait of the Jews; and he confesseth that he was tempted therewith, as he was not hardened, though he did not faint. For he is not ashamed to confess his infirmity.</p><p>His drift is, that those to whom he speaketh may not faint, through like tribulations; and that, being void of all ambition, they may do their duty carefully and reverently; and that they may not only with a patient mind suffer themselves to be despised of men, but that they may be cast down in themselves. Because, that man can never be rightly framed to obey Christ whose looks are lofty, and whose heart is proud. And (as men cannot long bear a show of virtue) to the end it may appear manifestly, that he behaved himself sincerely and from his heart, he maketh mention of his constancy which lasted three years, wherein he had still kept one course. Ye know (saith he) how I have behaved myself since the first day until this time. To conclude, this is the true trial of the servants of Christ, not to be changed as the times change; but to continue like to themselves, and always to keep a straight course.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(413)</span></p><p>“ Probatio,” proof or tests </p><p><span class="cite-note">(414)</span></p><p>“ Longe imparem,” far from being equal to it. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(415)</span></p><p>“ Adjungit,” he addeth, </p><p><span class="cite-note">(416)</span></p><p>“ Trepidam vitam,” a life of trembling. </p></div></div>
