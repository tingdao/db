<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Thou shalt say to this people, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold I set before you the way of life and the way of death. </em>Which was the way of death? <em>Whosoever, </em>he says, <em>abides in this city, shall die by the sword, or by famine, or by pestilence </em>This was incredible to the Jews, and they were no doubt inflamed with rage when they heard that they were to perish in the holy city which God protected; for there he had his sanctuary, and there his rest was. But the Prophet had already dissipated all these delusions; he could, therefore, boldly threaten them, though they still alleged their vain pretences: he had shewed reasons enough why they could hope for nothing less than exile from God, for they had so many times, and so obstinately, and in such various ways provoked him. This, then, he says, is the <em>way of death, </em>it is by remaining in the city. And he mentions several kinds of evils, and shews that God was armed not only with a hostile sword, but would also employ famine and pestilence, so that he would kill some with the sword, consume some with famine, and destroy some with pestilence. Hence he shews that they would be so assailed on every side, that it would be in vain to attempt to escape; for when they shunned the sword, pestilence would meet them; and when they were preserved from the pestilence, the famine would consume them. </p><p>He then adds, <em>But he who went out to the Chaldeans, who besieged the city, </em>etc., that is, who willingly surrendered himself; for it was a sign of obedience when the Jews with a resigned mind received correction; and it was also an evidence of repentance, for they thus confessed that they were worthy of the heaviest punishment. This is the reason why the Prophet represents it as <em>the way of life </em>to go out willingly, and to make a surrender of themselves of their own accord to their enemies. And by saying, <em>who besiege you, </em><span class="lang he-il">הצרים עליכם</span><em>, etserim olicam, </em>he wished to anticipate objections which any one of the people might have alleged, — “How can I dare thus to expose myself? for the Chaldeans besiege us, and it will be all over with me as to my life if I go forth as a suppliant to them.” By no means, says the Prophet, for though they carry on a deadly war with the city<em>, </em>yet every one who of his own accord goes forth to them shall be safe, and shall find them ready to shew mercy. God would not have promised this had he not the Chaldeans in his own power, so that he could turn their minds as he pleased. </p><p>As to the verb <span class="lang he-il">נפל</span>, <em>nuphel, </em>it means strictly to fall; but I consider that it signifies here to dwell, as in <span class="bvs">Gen_25:27</span><em>, </em>where it is said that Ishmael dwelt in the sight of, or over against his brethren. They who render it “died” touch neither heaven nor earth. Some read, “his lot fell among his brethren;” but this is an unnatural rendering. There is, then, no doubt but that the verb means often to lie down, and hence to dwell; and yet I allow that the Prophet alludes to subjection; for we must remember what must have been their condition when they went over to the Chaldeans; they must have been subjected to great reproach. It was then no small humiliation; but yet we may properly render the verb to dwell. <em>He, </em>then, <em>who went out to the Chaldeans and dwelt with them, </em><span class="cite-ref">(24)</span> that is, who suffered himself to be led into exile, or who migrated according to their will from his own country to a foreign land — <em>he, </em>he says, <em>shall live, </em>and <em>his life shall be for a prey, </em>that is, he shall save his life, as when any one finds a prey and takes it as his own by stealth; for prey is to be taken here as an accidental gain. Whosoever, then, he says, shall not deem it too grievous a thing to submit to the Chaldeans, shall at least save his life. </p><p>In short, God intimates that the wickedness of the people had advanced so far, that it was not right to forgive them. What, then, was to be done by them? to submit with resignation and humility to a temporal punishment, and thus to cease to shut up the door of God’s mercy. He, however, teaches them at the same time that no salvation could be hoped for by them until they were chastised. And hence we may learn a useful doctrine, and that is, that whenever we provoke God’s wrath by our perverseness, we cannot be exempt from all punishment; and that we ought not to be impatient, especially when he punishes us moderately; and that provided we obtain eternal mercy, we ought submissively to bear paternal corrections. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(24)</strong> “Shall go to,” is the Sept.; “shall fly to,” the Vulg.; “shall obey,” the Targ.; it is omitted in Syr. Blayney is, “surrendereth himself.” The verb, followed by <span class="lang he-il">על</span>, as here, means to fall away to, or to join. See <span class="bvs">2Kg_25:11</span>. “But he who goeth out and joins the Chaldeans, who besiege you, shall live,” etc. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
