<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Have I committed an offense? </em>His humility was cast up to him by way of reproach, while it was an excellence that was deserving of no ordinary commendation. <em>Humility </em>here means — voluntary abasement; for in conducting himself modestly, as if he had nothing in him that was particularly excellent, so that many looked upon him as one of the common people, he had done that for the advantage of the Corinthians. For the man was inflamed with so great a desire, <span class="cite-ref">(823)</span> and so great an anxiety for their salvation, that he made a regard to himself a secondary consideration. Hence he says, that he had of his own accord made a surrender of his own greatness, that they might become great through his abasement. For his design was, that he might promote their salvation. He now indirectly charges them with ingratitude, in imputing to him as a fault so pious a disposition — not indeed for the purpose of reproaching him, but with the view of restoring them so much the better to a sound mind. And certainly, he wounded them more severely by speaking <em>ironically, </em>than if he had spoken in a simple way, and without a figure. He might have said, “What is this? Am I despised by you, because I have lowered myself for your advantage?” The questioning, however, which he makes use of, was more forcible for putting them to shame. </p><p><em>Because I preached freely </em>This is a part of his abasement. For he had given up his own right, as though his condition had been inferior to that of others; but such was the unreasonableness of some of them, that they esteemed him the less on that account, as if he had been undeserving of remuneration. The reason, why he had given his services to the Corinthians gratuitously, is immediately subjoined — for he did not act in this manner everywhere, but, as we have seen in the former Epistle, <span class="cite-ref">(824)</span> there was a danger of his furnishing the false Apostles with a handle against him. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(823)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Car ce sainct Apostre estoit tellement embrasse du desir</span>.” — “For this holy Apostle was to such a degree inflamed with desire.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(824)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>See Calvin on the Corinthians, vol. 1, p. 288. </p></div></div>
