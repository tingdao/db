<div class="comment-content"><p>By<em>evil days, </em>or <em>days of evil, </em>the Psalmist might thus mean the everlasting destruction which awaits the ungodly, whom God has spared for a certain interval. Or his words may be expounded as signifying, that the man is blessed who has learned to be composed and tranquil under trials. The rest intended would then be that of an inward kind, enjoyed by the believer even during the storms of adversity; and the scope of the passage would be, that the truly happy man is he who has so far profited, by the word of God, as to sustain the assault of evils from without, with peace and composure. But as it is added, <em>whilst </em><span class="cite-ref">(28)</span><em>the pit is digged for the wicked, </em>it would seem necessary, in order to bring out the opposition contained in the two members of the sentence, to suppose that the Psalmist rather commends the wisdom of those who reckon that God afflicts them with a view to saving them from destruction, and bringing them eventually to a happy issue. It was necessary to state this second ground of comfort, because our hearts cannot fail to be affected with the most intense grief when we see the wicked triumph, and no Divine restraint put upon them. The Psalmist meets the temptation by appropriately reminding us that the wicked are left upon earth, just as a dead body which is stretched out upon a bed, till its grave be dug. Here believers are warned that, if they would preserve their constancy, they must mount their watchtower, as Habakkuk says, (<span class="bvs">Hab_2:1</span>) and take a view in the distance of God’s judgments. They shall see worldly men rioting in worldly delights, and, if they extend their view no farther, they will give way to impatience. But it would moderate their grief, would they only remember that those houses which are nominally appropriated to the living, are, in fact, only granted to the dead, until their grave be digged; and that, though they remain upon earth, they are already devoted to destruction. <span class="cite-ref">(29)</span></p><p><strong>(28)</strong> In our English Bible it is “<em>until </em>the pit be digged:” on which Hammond, who gives the same translation as Calvin, comments as follows: — “The rendering of <span class="lang he-il">עד</span>, <em>until</em>, in this place, may much disturb the sense, and make it believed that the <em>rest </em><span class="lang he-il">מימי רע</span>,<em>from the evil days</em>, <em>i e</em>. , from persecution, (see <span class="bvs">Eph_5:16</span>,) which God gives to good men, is to continue <em>till </em>the pit be digged for the ungodly, <em>i e</em>. , till the measure of their sins be filled up, and so destruction be ready for them: whereas, the contrary of this is evident, that either the destruction of the wicked is first, and the quiet and rest of the good (oppressed by them) a natural effect of that, and so subsequent to it; or that both of them are of the same date, at once ‘tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you who are troubled rest,’ <span class="bvs">2Th_1:6</span>. And this is evidently the meaning of it here, and so will be discerned, if only the <span class="lang he-il">אד</span> be rendered <em>dum </em>,<em>whilst</em>, (as it is elsewhere used, <span class="bvs">Jon_4:2</span>, <span class="lang he-il">אד היותי</span>, ‘whilst I was,’ <span class="bvs">Job_1:16</span>, <span class="lang he-il">אד זה מדבר</span>, ‘whilst he was speaking,’) for then thus it will run very fitly, ‘That thou mayest give him rest — whilst the pit is digged —’” Horsley reads the verse — </p><p>“To produce ease for him out of the days of adversity, Whilst the pit is digging for the impious.” </p><p><strong>(29)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que les maisons qui sont destinees aux vivans, pour un peu de temps sont bien concedees aux morts cependant qu’on leur fait leur fosse; et qu’en ceste facon ceux qui neantmoins sont destinez a perdition, demeurent en vie</span>,” etc. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
