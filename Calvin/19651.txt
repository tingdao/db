<div class="comment-content"><p>Many interpreters connect the first of these verses with the preceding ones, and they seem not to think so without reason; for the reason given is not unsuitable, if we refer to what the Prophet had said, even that the Jews were by no means to hope for a return until the end of seventy years. But the meaning I adopt is more probable; the particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, <em>ki, </em>is repeated; the first is causal, and the second an illative; <span class="cite-ref">(219)</span> and consistently with the usage of Scripture the learned and the experienced think that this is the real meaning of the Prophet. He then says, that the captives were very foolish who hoped for a quick end to their exile, because they had false prophets who gave them such a promise; <em>ye have </em>then <em>said, that prophets have been given you, in Chaldea, </em>and that God had there pitied you, because there are those who prophesy of a return in a short time. As then ye are so foolishly credulous, <em>Thus saith Jehovah to your brethren, </em>he then turns his discourse to the exiles, and exhorts them not to suffer themselves to be led astray. But here he indirectly reproves them, because they could not bear a condition which was even better than that of the residue, as though he had said, “What means this your unreasonableness! that when all your ways are closed up against you, and the power of your conqueror is so great that ye cannot move a finger without his nod, ye should yet think that you shall be set free in two years! and surely if you were before foolishly secure and confident, your calamities ought now to make you humble. But your brethren, who seem yet to enjoy liberty because they dwell at Jerusalem, (for those alone were then remaining,) even these your brethren suffer far more grievously than ye do.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(219)</span> Gataker approves of this and says, evidently referring to Calvin, “So an interpreter of prime note rendereth it.” That <span class="lang he-il">כי</span> is sometimes an iliative is generally admitted; and here the connection cannot otherwise be seen. There is a large gap after the 15<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse (<span class="bvs">Jer_29:15</span>) in the Sept., the verses 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 (<span class="bvs">Jer_29:16</span>), are omitted, but not in the other versions nor in the Targ.; and Blayney has thereby been led to put the 15<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse out of its place and set it between the 20<span class="cite-ref">th</span> and the 21<span class="cite-ref">st</span>, but without sufficient reason. The connection, as shewn by Calvin, is suitable as the verse now is, and by removing it, the drift of what follows is not so clearly seen. </p><p>Another thing advanced by Blayney, though countenanced by Houbigant and Horsley, two rival innovators, is not to be admitted, — that the letter terminates at the end of the 20<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse (<span class="bvs">Jer_29:20</span>), and not at the end of the 23d (<span class="bvs">Jer_29:23</span>), and that what follows forms another letter. It is evident that what is contained in the 24<span class="cite-ref">th</span> (<span class="bvs">Jer_29:24</span>) and in the following verses to the end, was written in consequence of an answer from Babylon to this letter. Compare verse 5<span class="cite-ref">th</span> (<span class="bvs">Jer_29:5</span>) with the 28<span class="cite-ref">th</span> (<span class="bvs">Jer_29:28</span>). — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
