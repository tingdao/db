It was apparently a laudable thing to despise money, but he says, that they make use of a pretense for the purpose of deceiving, exactly as if a harlot were to borrow the apparel of a decent matron. For it was necessary to pull off the mask, which obscured the glory of God. </p><p>They are <em>deceitful workers, </em>says he, that is — they do not discover their wickedness at first view, but artfully insinuate themselves under some fair pretext. <span class="cite-ref">(834)</span> Hence they require to be carefully and thoroughly sifted, lest we should receive persons as servants of Christ, as soon as any appearance of excellence is discovered. Nor does Paul in malice and envy put an unfavorable construction upon what might be looked upon as an excellence, but, constrained by their dishonesty, he unfolds to view the evil that lay hid, because there was a dangerous profanation of virtue in pretending to burn with greater zeal than all the servants of Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(834)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">S’insinuent finement sans qu’on y prene garde</span>;” — “They artfully insinuate themselves, unless one be on his guard against them.” </p></div></div>
