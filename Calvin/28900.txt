<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>For he saith, In an acceptable time. </em>He quotes a prediction of Isaiah, exceedingly appropriate to the exhortation of which he speaks. It is without doubt of the kingdom of Christ that he there speaks, <span class="cite-ref">(576)</span> as is manifest from the context. The Father, then, appointing his Son a leader, for the purpose of gathering together a Church, addresses him in these words: </p><p>“I have heard thee in an acceptable time.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_49:8</span>.) </p><p>We know, however, what a degree of correspondence <span class="cite-ref">(577)</span> there is between the Head and the members. For Christ was heard in our name, as the salvation of all of us is entrusted into his hand, and nothing else has he taken under his charge. Hence we are all admonished in the person of Christ — not to slight the opportunity that is afforded for obtaining salvation. While the rendering of the Greek interpreter is, <span class="lang el-gr">εὐπρόσδεκτον,</span> (<em>acceptable,</em>) <span class="cite-ref">(578)</span> the word made use of by the Prophet is, <span class="lang he-il">רצון</span>, (<em>ratson,</em>) that is, benevolence, or free favour. <span class="cite-ref">(579)</span></p><p>The quotation must be applied to the subject in hand in this way: “As God specifies a particular time for the exhibition of his grace, it follows that all times are not suitable for that. As a particular <em>day of salvation </em>is named, it follows that a free offer of salvation is not made every day.” Now this altogether depends on the providence of God, for the<em>acceptable time </em>is no other than what is called in <span class="bvs">Gal_4:4</span>, <em>the fullness of the time </em><span class="cite-ref">(580)</span> The order of arrangement also must be observed. First, he makes mention of a <em>time of benevolence, </em>and then afterwards of a <em>day of salvation </em>By this it is intimated, that salvation flows to us from the mercy of God exclusively, as from a fountainhead. Hence we must not seek the cause in ourselves, as if we by means of our own works moved God to assign to us his favor, for whence comes the <em>day of salvation? </em>It is because it is the <em>acceptable time, </em>that is, the time which God has in his free favor appointed. In the mean time, we must keep in view what Paul designs to teach — that there is need of prompt expedition, that we may not allow the opportunity to pass unimproved, inasmuch as it displeases God, that the grace that he offers to us should be received by us with coolness and indifference. </p><p><em>Behold now is the time </em>The Prophet had spoken of the time, when Christ was to be manifested in the flesh for the redemption of men. Paul transfers the prophecy to the time when Christ is revealed by the continued preaching of the gospel, and it is with good reason that he does so, for as <em>salvation </em>was once sent to the whole world, when Christ appeared, so now it is sent to us every day, when we are made partakers of the gospel. Here we have a beautiful passage, and affording no ordinary consolation, because, while the gospel is preached to us, we know assuredly that the way is opened up for us into the kingdom of God, and that there is a signal of divine benevolence raised aloft, to invite us to receive <em>salvation, </em>for the opportunity of obtaining it must be judged of by the call. Unless, however, we embrace the opportunity, we must fear the threatening that Paul brings forward — that, in a short time, the door will be shut against all that have not entered in, while opportunity was afforded. For this retribution always follows contempt of the word. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(576)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ne faut point douter, que le Prophete ne parle du regne de Christ</span>;” — “There is no room to doubt, that the Prophet speaks of the kingdom of Christ.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(577)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quelle similitude et proportion ou conuenance</span>;” — “What a resemblance, and proportion, or correspondence.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(578)</span> The precise word in the Septuagint version (with which the Apostle’s quotation exactly corresponds) is <span class="lang el-gr">δεκτῳ</span>, (acceptable.)

Ea igitur demum iusta est opportunitas ac recta agendi dispensatio, qu’ providentia Dei regitur;” — “He proceeds with the comparison which he had brought forward, and applies to his purpose the expression which had been made use of — <em>the time appointed by the father</em>, but still showing that that time, which had been ordained by the providence of God, was proper and suitable. That alone is the fit season, and that the right system of acting, which is directed by the providence of God.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
