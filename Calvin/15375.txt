<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>48.</strong><em>What man shall live, and shall not see death? </em>This verse contains a confirmation of what has been already stated concerning the brevity of human life. The amount is, that unless God speedily hasten to show himself a father to men, the opportunity of causing them to experience his grace will no longer exist. The original word <span class="lang he-il">גבר</span>, <em>geber, </em>which we have translated <em>man, </em>is derived from the verb <span class="lang he-il">גבר</span>, <em>gabar, he was strong, </em>or <em>he prevailed; </em>and the sacred writer employs this word, the more forcibly to express the truth, that no man is privileged with exemption from the dominion of death. </p></div>
