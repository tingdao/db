<div class="comment-content"><p>The words <span class="lang he-il">אל-תעמדו</span>, <em>al-tomedu, </em>may be explained in two ways, — “Stand not,” that is, “Hasten quickly,” as it is the case with those in extreme fear; or, “Ye shall not stand,” that is, “Though ye may seek a firm position on Mount Sion, ye shall not yet be able to continue there.” The first exposition appears to me the best, as it is more suitable to the context. <span class="cite-ref">(102)</span></p><p><strong>(102)</strong> These two verses contain a very spirited address, in a style truly poetical, — </p><p><strong>5.</strong>Announce ye in Judah, And in Jerusalem publish, and say, — Yea, sound the trumpet in the land, Proclaim, do it fully, and say, — “Be assembled, and let us enter into fortified cities; </p><p><strong>6.</strong>Raise a banner towards Sion; Hasten ye, stay not:“ For an evil am I bringing from the north, And a great destruction. </p><p>The people of Judah were summoned to enter into fortified cities, and Mount Sion was to be the resort of the inhabitants of Jerusalem: “Hasten ye,“ <span class="lang el-gr">σπεύσατε</span> — hasten, <em>Septuagint. </em>This is the meaning of <span class="lang he-il">עז</span> in Hiphil. See <span class="bvs">Exo_9:19</span>; <span class="bvs">Isa_10:31</span>. In <span class="bvs">Jer_6:1</span>, it is translated “Gather yourselves to flee;” but “hasten,” or remove vigorously or quickly, would be the best rendering. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
