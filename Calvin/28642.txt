<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>To one is given </em>He now subjoins an enumeration, or, in other words, specifies particular kinds — not indeed all of them, but such as are sufficient for his present purpose. <em>“Believers,” </em>says he, <em>“are </em>endowed with different gifts, but let every one <em>acknowledge, </em>that he is indebted for whatever he has to the Spirit of God, for he pours forth his gifts as the sun scatters his rays in every direction. As to the <em>difference </em>between these gifts, <em>knowledge </em>(or understanding) and <em>wisdom </em>are taken in different senses in the Scriptures, but here I take them in the way of less and greater, as in <span class="bvs">Col_2:3</span>, where they are also joined together, when Paul says, that <em>in Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Knowledge, </em>therefore, in my opinion, means <em>acquaintance with sacred things </em>— <em>Wisdom, </em>on the other hand, means the perfection of it. Sometimes <em>prudence </em>is put, as it were, in the middle place between these two, and in that case it denotes skill <span class="cite-ref">(737)</span> in applying knowledge to some useful purpose. They are, it is true, <em>very </em>nearly allied; but still you observe a difference when they are put together. Let us then take<em>knowledge </em>as meaning <em>ordinary information, </em>and <em>wisdom, </em>as including revelations that are of a more secret and sublime order. <span class="cite-ref">(738)</span></p><p>The term <em>faith </em>is employed here to mean a special faith, as we shall afterwards see from the context. A special faith is of such a kind as does not apprehend Christ wholly, for redemption, righteousness, and sanctification, but only in so far as miracles are performed in his name. Judas had a faith of this kind, and he wrought miracles too by means of it. Chrysostom distinguishes it in a somewhat different manner, calling it the faith of miracles, not of doctrines. <span class="cite-ref">(739)</span> This, however, does not differ much from the interpretation previously mentioned. By the <em>gift of healings </em><span class="cite-ref">(740)</span> every one knows what is meant. </p><p>As to the <em>workings of powers, </em>or, as some render it, the <em>operations of influences, </em>there is more occasion for doubt. I am inclined, however, to think, that what is meant is the influence which is exercised against devils, and also against hypocrites. When, therefore, Christ and his Apostles by authority restrained devils, or put them to flight, that was <span class="lang el-gr">ἐνέργημα</span><em>, (powerful working,) </em>and, in like manner, when Paul smote the sorcerer with blindness, (<span class="bvs">Act_13:11</span>,) and when Peter struck Ananias and Sapphira dead upon the spot with a single word. The gifts of <em>healing </em>and of miracles, therefore, serve to manifest the goodness of God, but this last, his severity for the destruction of Satan. <span class="cite-ref">(741)</span></p><p><em>By prophecy, </em>I understand the singular and choice endowment of unfolding the secret will of God, so that a Prophet is a messenger, as it were, between God and man. <span class="cite-ref">(742)</span> My reason for taking this view will be explained more fully afterwards. </p><p>The<em>discerning of spirits, </em>was a clearness of perception in forming a judgment as to those who professed to be <em>something</em>. (<span class="bvs">Act_5:36</span>.) I speak not of that natural wisdom, by which we are regulated in judging. It was a special illumination, with which some were endowed by the gift of God. The use of it was this: that they might not be imposed upon by masks, of mere pretences, <span class="cite-ref">(743)</span> but might by that spiritual judgment distinguish, as by a particular mark, the true ministers of Christ from the false. </p><p>There was a difference between the <em>knowledge of tongues, </em>and the <em>interpretation </em>of them, for those who were endowed with the former were, in many cases, not acquainted with the language of the nation with which they had to deal. The <em>interpreters </em><span class="cite-ref">(744)</span> rendered foreign tongues into the native language. These endowments they did not at that time acquire by labor or study, but were put in possession of them by a wonderful revelation of the Spirit. <span class="cite-ref">(745)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(737)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le sqauoir et la dexterite</span>;” — “Skill and dexterity.” As to this use of the term <em>prudentia</em>, (<em>prudence</em>,) see Cicero de Officiis, 1. 43. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(738)</span> One of the most satisfactory views of this subject is that of Dr. Henderson in his Lecture on “Divine Inspiration,” (pp. 193,196,) who understands by <span class="lang el-gr">σοφία</span>, (<em>wisdom</em>,) in this passage, “the sublime truths of the gospel, directly revealed to the Apostles, of which the <span class="lang el-gr">λογος</span> (<em>word</em>) was the supernatural ability rightly to communicate them to others;” and by <span class="lang el-gr">λόγος γνώσεως</span> (<em>word of knowledge</em>,) the faculty of “infallibly explaining truths and doctrines which had been previously divulged.” — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(739)</span> Chrysostom’s words are: <span class="lang el-gr">Πίστιν οὐ παύτην λέγει τὴν τῶν δογμάτων ἀλλὰ τὴν τῶν σημείων</span>. “By this faith he means not that of doctrines, but that of miraeles.” — It was called by the schoolmen <em>fides miractelorum </em> (<em>faith of miracles</em>.) — <em>Ed </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(740)</span> The plural is made use of, it is manifest, to intimate the number and variety of the diseases that were healed — the Apostles having been invested with power to <em>heal all manner of sickness</em>, <em>and all manner of disease</em>. (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:1</span>.) — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(741)</span> There does not appear to be sufficient ground for understanding the <em>miracles </em>here referred to as necessarily <em>deeds of terror</em>, while the connection in which the expression occurs seems to intimate, that the <em>miracles </em>here meant were more than ordinarily stupendous manifestations of Divine power, such as would powerfully constrain the beholder to exclaim, <em>This is the finger of God </em>! Thus, “the resuscitation of the dead, the innocuous handlng of serpents, or drinking of empoisoned liquor, the dispossession of demons, and the infliction of blindness,” as in the case of Elymas, the sorcerer, and of death itself, as in the case of Ananias and Sapphira,. were <em>mighty deeds </em>— to which “no mere created power could possibly pretend, under any circumstances, or by the application of any means whatever.” See <em>Henderson on Inspiration</em>, pp. 203-206. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(742)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Apportant la volonte de Dieu aux hommes</span>;” — “Communicating the will of God to men.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(743)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par la montre et belle apparence que les gens ont aucuneffois</span>;” — “By the show and fair appearance which persons sometimes have.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(744)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et en tel cas ceux que auoyent le don d’interpretation des langues</span>;” — “And in such a case, those who had the gift of interpreting languages.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(745)</span> The following classification of the, <em>gifts</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">χαρίσματα</span>) here enumerated by the Apostle, is suggested by Dr. Henderson, as tending to show the “beautiful symmetry” of the passage: — </p><p>I<span class="lang el-gr">. ̔Ω μὲν — λόγος σοφίας </span>  —  (I. <em>To one</em>, <em>the word of wisdom</em>)<LineBreak />2<span class="lang el-gr">. ἄλλῳ δὲ λογος γνώσες </span>  —  (2. <em>to another</em>, <em>the word of knowledge</em>.)<LineBreak />II<span class="lang el-gr">. ̔ΕΤΕΡΩ δὲ πίστις </span> —  (II. <em>To another</em>, <em>faith</em>,)<LineBreak />1<span class="lang el-gr">. ἄλλῳ δὲ χαρίσματα ἰαμάτων </span> —  (1. <em>to another</em>, <em>gifts of healing</em>,)<LineBreak />2<span class="lang el-gr">. ἄλλῳ δὲ ἐνεργήματα δυμάμεων </span>  —  (2. <em>to another</em>, <em>working of miracles</em>,)<LineBreak />3<span class="lang el-gr">. ἄλλῳ δὲ προφητεια </span>  —  (3. <em>to another</em>, <em>prophecy</em>,)<LineBreak />4<span class="lang el-gr">. ἄλλῳ δὲ διαχρίσεις πνευμάτων </span>  —  (4. <em>to another</em>, <em>discerning of spirits</em>.)<LineBreak />III<span class="lang el-gr">. ̔ΕΤΕΡΩ δὲ γένη γλωσσῶν </span> —  (III. <em>To another</em>, <em>divers kinds of tongues</em>,)<LineBreak />2<span class="lang el-gr">. ἄλλῳ δὲ ἑρμηνεία γλωσσῶν </span>  —  (2. <em>to another</em>, <em>interpretation of tongues</em>.) </p><p>Thus the <em>first </em>class includes “the word of wisdom,” and “the word of knowledge. Under the head of <em>faith</em>, that is, the faith of miracles, four kinds of gifts are enumerated — “gifts of healing,” — “working of miracles,” — “prophecy,” and “discerning of spirits;” while the <em>third </em>class includes “divers kinds of tongues,” and “the interpretation of tongues.” See <em>Henderson on Inspiration</em>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
