<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>He being therefore exalted by the right hand of God </em>The right hand is taken in this place for the hand or power, in like sort as it is taken everywhere in the Scripture. For this is his drift, to declare that it was a wonderful work of God, in that he had exalted his Christ (whom men thought to be quite destroyed by death) unto so great glory. </p><p><em>The promise </em>of the Spirit for the Spirit which was promised. For he had oftentimes before promised the Spirit to his apostles. Therefore Peter doth signify, that Christ had obtained power of God the Father to fulfill the same. And he maketh mention of the promise in plain words, to the end the <em>Jews </em>may know that this came not to pass suddenly, but that the words of the prophet were now verified, which went long time before the thing itself. </p><p>Furthermore, whereas it is said that he obtained it of <em>the Father, </em>it is to be applied to the person of the Mediator. For both these are truly said, that Christ sent the Spirit from himself and from the Father. He sent him from himself, because he is eternal God; from the Father, because in as much as he is man, he receiveth that of the Father which he giveth us. And Peter speaketh wisely according to the capacity of the ignorant, lest any man should move a question out of season concerning the power of Christ. And surely forasmuch as it is the office of Christ to direct us unto his Father, this is a most apt form of speaking for the use of godliness, that Christ being placed, as it were, in the midst between God and us, doth deliver unto us with his own hand those gifts which he hath received at the hands of his Father. Furthermore, we must note this order that he saith, that the Spirit was sent by Christ after that he was exalted. This agreeth with those sentences: </p><p>“The Spirit was not yet given, <LineBreak />because Christ was not yet glorified,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_7:39</span>.) </p><p>And again, </p><p>“Unless I go hence, the Spirit will not come,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_16:7</span>.) </p><p>Not because the Spirit began then first to be given, wherewith the holy fathers were endued since the beginning of the world; but because God did defer this more plentiful abundance of grace, until such time as he had placed Christ in his princely seat; which is signified by this word <em>poured out, </em>as we saw a little before. For by this means the force and fruit of Christ his death and resurrection is sealed; and we do also thereby know, that we have lost nothing by Christ his departing out of the world; because, though he be absent in body, yet is he present with us after a better sort, to wit, by the grace of his Holy Spirit. </p></div>
