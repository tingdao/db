<div class="comment-content"><p>This verse is connected with the last, and more fully explains what had been briefly said. The plucking off of the sealing ring from God’s finger took place when Jeconiah was deprived of his glory and his kingdom, and made subject; to the king of Babylon. <span class="cite-ref">(66)</span> Though the king spared his life, as sacred history testifies, (<span class="bvs">2Kg_25:7</span>; <span class="bvs">2Ch_36:6</span>; <span class="bvs">Jer_52:11</span>,) yet when he surrendered himself to him, he trembled as though he saw the sword ready to cut off his head; for he expected no mercy, and his fear made him to go out of the city, and to surrender himself to his inveterate enemy. The import of the whole is, that King Jeconiah would come to extremities, for he would be forced to give up himself helpless and unarmed into the hands of his cruel enemies. </p><p>But he repeats the commination, and enlarges on the subject; <em>I will deliver thee, </em>he says, <em>into the hand of those who seek thy life, </em>and then, <em>into the hand of those whose face thou dreadest, </em>and, in the third place, <em>into the hand of Nebuchadnezer, </em>(Nabuchadnezer, king of Babylon, is called here and in other places, Nebuchadrezer,) and lastly, <em>into the hand of the Chaldeans. </em>Thus the Prophet recounts, as it were in order, several kinds of death, that Jeconiah might know how dreadful God’s judgment would be. He adds — </p><p><strong>(66)</strong> There is here a striking contrast: God would pluck off Jeconiah, were he like a signet on his right hand, and would deliver him into the hand of his enemies. From being as it were on the divine hand, he would be given up into the hand of those who sought his life. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
