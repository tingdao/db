<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>51.</strong><em>With which thy enemies, O Jehovah! have reproached thee. </em>What the Psalmist now affirms is, not that the wicked torment the saints with their contumelious language, but that they revile even God himself. And he makes this statement, because it is a much more powerful plea for obtaining favor in the sight of God, to beseech him to maintain his own cause, because all the reproaches by which the simplicity of our faith is held up to scorn recoil upon himself, than to beseech him to do this, because he is wounded in the person of his Church; according as he declares in Isaiah, </p><p>“Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed; and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_37:23</span>) </p><p>That wicked robber Rabshakeh thought that he scoffed only at the wretched Jews whom he besieged, and whose surrender of themselves into his hands he believed he would soon witness; but God took it as if he himself had been the object whom that wicked man directly assailed. On this account also, the prophet calls these enemies of his people <em>the enemies of God; </em>namely, because in persecuting the Church with deadly hostility, they made an assault upon the majesty of God, under whose protection the Church was placed. </p><p>In the second clause, by <em>the footsteps of Messiah </em>or <em>Christ </em>is meant the coming of Christ, even as it is said in <span class="bvs">Isa_52:7</span>, </p><p>“How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace!” (<span class="bvs">Isa_52:7</span>) </p><p>The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">עקב</span>, <em>akeb, </em>sometimes signifies <em>the heel; </em>but here, as in many other passages, it signifies <em>the sole of the foot. </em>Others translate it <em>the pace </em>or <em>step, </em>but this gives exactly the same sense. There can be no doubt, that <em>footsteps, </em>by the figure synecdoche, is employed to denote <em>the feet; </em>and again, that by <em>the feet, </em>according to the figure metonomy, is meant the coming of Christ. The wicked, observing that the Jews clung to the hope of redemption, and patiently endured all adversities because a deliverer had been promised them, disdainfully derided their patience, as if all that the prophets had testified concerning the coming of Christ had been only a fable. <span class="cite-ref">(560)</span> And now also, although he has been once manifested to the world, yet as, in consequence of his having been received up into the glory of heaven, he seems to be far distant from us, and to have forsaken his Church, these filthy dogs scoff at our hope, as if it were a mere delusion. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(560)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De la revelation faite a Samuel</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
