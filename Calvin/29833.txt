<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>The husbandman must labor before he receive the fruits </em>I am well aware that others render this passage differently; and I acknowledge that they translate, word for word, what Paul has written in Greek; but he who shall carefully examine the context will assent to my view. <span class="cite-ref">(161)</span> Besides, the use of (<span class="lang el-gr">κοπιῶντα</span>) <em>to labor </em>instead of (<span class="lang el-gr">κοπιᾷν</span>)<em>to labor, </em>is a well-known Greek idiom; for Greek writers often make use of the participle in place of the infinitive. <span class="cite-ref">(162)</span></p><p>The meaning therefore, is, that husbandmen do not gather the fruit, till they have first toiled hard in the cultivation of the soil, by sowing and by other labors. And if husbandmen do not spare their toils, that one day they may obtain fruit, and if they patiently wait for the season of harvest; how much more unreasonable will it be for us to refuse the labors which Christ enjoins upon us, while he holds out so great a reward? </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(161)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Je scay bien que les autres ont tradoit ce passage autrement: Il faut que le laboureur travaillaut (ou, qui travaille) prene premier des fruits</span>.” — “I am well aware that others translate this passage differently: The husbandman laboring (or, who laboreth) must first partake of the fruits.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(162)</span> “The agonistic metaphor now passes into an agricultural one, (such as we find at <span class="bvs">1Co_9:10</span>; <span class="bvs">Jas_5:7</span>.) The sense, however, will depend upon what <span class="lang el-gr">πρῶτον</span> is to be referred to. It is most naturally connected with <span class="lang el-gr">μεταλαμβάνειν</span>, and such is the construction adopted by the generality of Expositors, ancient and modern. The sense, however, thus arising, either involves what is inconsistent with facts, or (even when helped out by the harsh ellipsis of <span class="lang el-gr">ἵνα κοπιᾷ</span>, ‘in order that he may be enabled to labor,’) contains a truth here inapposite; and the <em>spiritual </em>application thence deduced is forced and frigid. It is not, however, necessary, with some, to resort to conjecture. We have only to suppose, what is common in his writings, a somewhat harsh transposition, and (with many of the best Expositors) to join <span class="lang el-gr">πρῶτον</span> with <span class="lang el-gr">κοπιῶντα</span>, as is required by the course of the argument; the true construction being this: — <span class="lang el-gr">δεῖ τὸν γεωργὸν πρῶτον κοπιῶντα τῶν καρπῶν μεταλαμβάνειν</span>, where <span class="lang el-gr">κοπιὦντα</span> is the participle imperfect, and the literal sense is, — It is necessary that the husbandmen should first labor, and then enjoy the fruits (of his labor.)” — <em>Bloomfield. </em></p></div></div>
