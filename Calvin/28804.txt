<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>That we may be able to comfort </em>There can be no doubt, that, as he had a little before cleared his afflictions from reproach and unfavorable reports, so now he instructs the Corinthians, that his having come off victorious through heavenly consolation was for their sake and with a view to their advantage, that they may stir themselves up to fellowship in suffering, instead of haughtily despising his conflicts. As, however, the Apostle lived not for himself but for the Church, so he reckoned, that whatever favors God conferred upon him, were not given for his own sake merely, <span class="cite-ref">(221)</span> but in order that he might have more in his power for helping others. And, unquestionably, when the Lord confers upon us any favor, he in a manner invites us by his example to be generous to our neighbours. The riches of the Spirit, therefore, are not to be kept by us to ourselves, but every one must communicate to others what he has received. This, it is true, must be considered as being applicable chiefly to ministers of the Word. <span class="cite-ref">(222)</span> It is, however, common to all, according to the measure of each. Thus Paul here acknowledges, that he had been sustained by the <em>consolation of God, that he might be able himself to comfort others </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(221)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour son proufit particulier</span>;” — “For his own private advantage.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(222)</span> “It is not enough for the ministers of the gospel to have devoured many books of learning, to be able to decide polemical questions in divinity, to convince gainsayers, to be doctors angelical, subtle or profound; to be <em>mallei hereticorum </em> — <em>the hammer of heretics</em>. Unless also they have the experimental works of God’s Spirit upon their own souls, they are not able to apply themselves to the hearts of others. Paul had not been able to <em>comfort others</em>, if the Lord had not practically acquainted him with heavenly consolations.” — <em>Burgesse </em>on <span class="bvs">2Co_1:0</span>, p. 178 — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
