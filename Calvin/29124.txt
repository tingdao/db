<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>The Scripture hath concluded</em>. By the word Scripture is chiefly intended the law itself. It “hath concluded all under sin,” and therefore, instead of giving, it takes away righteousness from all. The reasoning is most powerful. “You seek righteousness in the law: but the law itself, with the whole of Scripture, leaves nothing to men but condemnation; for all men, with their works, are pronounced to be unrighteous: who then shall live by the law?” He alludes to these words, </p><p>“He who shall do these things, shall live in them.” (<span class="bvs">Lev_18:5</span>.) </p><p>Shut out by it, says he, from life through guilt, in vain should we seek salvation by the law. — The word translated <em>all </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">τὰ πάντα</span>) signifies <em>all things</em>, and conveys more than if he had said <em>all men</em>; for it embraces not only men, but every thing which they possess or can accomplish. </p><p><em>That the promise by faith</em>. There is no remedy but to throw away the righteousness of works, and betake ourselves to the faith of Christ. The result is certain. If works come into judgment, we are all condemned; therefore we obtain, by the faith of Christ, a free righteousness. This sentence is full of the highest consolation. It tells us that, wherever we hear ourselves condemned in Scripture, there is help provided for us in Christ, if we betake ourselves to him. We are lost, though God were silent: why then does he so often pronounce that we are lost? It is that we may not perish by everlasting destruction, but, struck and confounded by such a dreadful sentence, may by faith seek Christ, through whom we “pass from death into life.” (<span class="bvs">1Jo_3:14</span>.) By a figure of speech, (<span class="lang el-gr">μετωνυμία,</span>) in which the thing containing is put for the thing contained, the <em>promise </em>denotes that which is promised. </p></div>
